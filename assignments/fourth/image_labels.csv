They also had the lowest levels of support for then incumbent Petro Poroshenko, who is perceived here as the president of war. \nIn the recent parliamentary elections, the two regions changed their preferences and voted for Opposition Platform–For Life, a party representing former Yanukovych elites.

This is partly due to traditional support for pro-Russian politicians in this part of the country, which borders Russia.

The feet pose particular problems since they cannot be covered with insulation in the form of feathers or blubber yet have a wide surface area. Two mechanisms are at work. First, the penguin can control the rate of blood flow to the feet by varying the diameter of arterial vessels supplying the blood. In cold conditions the flow is reduced when it is warm the flow increases. \nHowever, penguins also have countercurrent heat exchangers at the top of the legs. Arteries supplying warm blood to the feet break up into many small vessels that are closely allied to similar numbers of venous vessels bringing cold blood back from the feet. Heat flows from the warm blood to the cold blood. This way penguin feet are held a degree or two above freezing—to minimise heat loss while avoiding frostbite. \nFollow @jasperdoest for more images of the wonders of nature and the human-wildlife relationship. #onassignment @natgeoexpeditions #penguin #feet #bird #winter}}]",123858,697,0.0004193085561719406,0.036970454900734716,0.02234999636290961,0

Nothing can stop Sarah, and today she is a renowned choreographer, dancer, and teacher, and a mother who teaches womens empowerment through workshops both at home in New York and internationally—and graces stages and videos all over the world.}}]",133962,402,0.0071871897886979594,0.013912771611692982,0.011222538882494974,0

Malaysia and Indonesia together produce 85% of the world\s palm oil. For a week in Kuala Lumpur, where I\m based, the city has been shrouded in a toxic haze from burning peat forests—set on fire to clear land for palm oil and pulpwood plantations on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The resulting haze can travel as far as neighboring Malaysia and Singapore. \nConservation biologist Adam Kamal explains why palm oil is so ubiquitous: It is in almost everything: toothpaste, ice cream, cosmetic creams, and even in some fuels. No other crop produces the same amount of vegetable oil per acre that oil palm does. However, while the productivity of well-maintained oil palm is amazing, the key issues now are the sustainable management of palm oil plantations, monocropping with heavy reliance on chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and expansion of plantations into pristine forest areas. High-quality forests are cut down for a one-off profit, which then eases the leasing of a clear-cut area for oil palm plantations. The key is to use already degraded land or land that aren’t primary forest or healthy secondary forest for these plantations as well as making sure that the supply chain is kept sustainable. Oil palm itself is not evil, but it must be regulated. #palmoil #environment #sustainability}}]",175334,682,0.03489906452663012,0.03579803032671565,0.03543844400668143,0

In two major ways, the Sundarbans is being impacted by climate change: first, the sea level is rising,  flooding lands with each high tide. When the tide retreats, the land is left more saline than before—and less able to grow crops. The same goes for the brackish creeks and river mouths dotting the forests. The second consequence: more big cyclones.

Toy Stories is the result of a 30-month trip, in which I visited more than 50 countries and took photographs of children and their favorite toys.

Perhaps that’s why I feel such empathy for the struggles of mothers in the wild. A harp seal mother does everything by herself. She gives birth on the ice where her pup will spend the first weeks of his life, suckling at her side until he is ready, around two weeks later, to slip over the lip of the ice and into the Arctic water. These pups are born without blubber, but they quickly pack it on from their mothers milk, which contains between 25% and 40% fat—the higher the fat content, the closer the pups are to leaving their mothers side. Pups grow from roughly 24 pounds at birth to 80 pounds by the time their mothers leave them to fend for themselves.

If this extra capacity becomes operational, it would make it much more difficult for the world to limit CO2 emissions. Despite China being a global frontrunner in investing in alternative energy, this would be a major setback, according to advocates.

Like the American bison, an animal that was once abundant and then hunted to the brink, only a fraction of oceanic whitetip shark populations remains today. Their numbers declined 93% between 1995 and 2010. Recovery will be difficult, because they reach sexual maturity by age seven and have small litters of pups every one to two years.

There are many. While we try not to anthropomorphize animals, there are individuals whose determination, dedication, and apparent kindness—even in the face of dire circumstances—speak volumes. One such female is a lioness in the Okavango known as Fekeetsa, a name that translates to overpower or overcome because of the odds that she faced. \nPerhaps she resonates particularly with me because I spent so much time with her after Dereck Joubert and I had been badly injured by a buffalo. We learnt her story after months of our own recovery and my close call with death. Fekeetsa was left with a broken wrist after a buffalo hunt went wrong. It should have been a death sentence, but she had young cubs to feed and she wasn\t going to give up on them. \nDespite undeniable pain, she changed her hunting strategy and searched the swamps for baby lechwe hidden in the reeds so she wouldn\t have to chase them. Every day she went out with the excruciating injury, and every day she brought food back for her cubs, who grew stronger and bigger. Gradually she began to heal, although she will always limp. At the beginning of this year she even adopted a cub that had strayed from its own pride and gotten lost—a phenomenon that is unheard of among lions. \nToday Fekeetsa\s cubs are nearing her size and she has recovered enough to broaden her hunts again. She has shown a spirit that I have seen in many women over the years—a knowledge that the responsibility lies with her and the complete refusal to accept failure.\n#Fekeetsa #ThisismyTrophy\n\nNat Geo is celebrating women who fearlessly push boundaries and inspire the next generation of changemakers.

This traditional blanket toss was held at Point Hope, Alaska’s annual whaling feast celebration in 2015. \nFor the people of Point Hope, nothing is more important than the bowhead whale. Their calendar year revolves around whaling, hunting, fishing, and gathering, a lifestyle Alaskans call subsistence, which is as much cultural tradition as dietary and economic necessity. This tradition is at risk as a result of climate change.

In Christianity, the stork is linked with purification, and followers of Islam revered storks because they made an annual pilgrimage through Mecca on their migration. \nHowever, since the mid-1980s, increasing numbers of white storks have chosen to stay on the European continent all year, rather than migrate to Africa in winter.

Her husband, Aleksander, chose to rebel against the war’s indignity in his own way: like many people in eastern Ukraine, he refuses to leave his demolished house. He continues living in the basement–the only surviving part–and cultivates the garden. Every day he takes a bike ride through the minefield that separates Opytnoe from Avdeevka to visit his wife. Tatiana prepares him a meal to take back, as he has no kitchen left in the ruins.\nTatiana lost a court hearing over compensation for her house. She felt humiliated by the attitude of the hearing members: “They would ask me questions like, why do I think that my house was shelled? Then they turned to a witness and began interrogating her about what brand of refrigerator I had and how many burners there were on the gas stove. They were talking to us like they assumed we were lying and it was their job to catch us out.” Ukraine’s official position is that Russia is to blame for the war, and so all claims should be addressed across the border. \nWords by Alisa Sopova, from the series #5Kfromthefrontline, an ongoing project about the everyday consequences of the war in eastern Ukraine.}}]",280728,1762,0.10549428172980184,0.1202125996560888,0.11432527248557403,1

They are the largest toothed predators in the world with the largest brains, and their skeletons are designed to handle the immense pressure of their deep ocean dives. A flexible cartilage connects the spine to the ribs, which means the rib cage collapses under heavy pressure instead of snapping. These whales were historically hunted for their oil and spermaceti, a mixture of fat and waxes found in their heads. Spermaceti was used to make candles and cosmetics, among other things.

Follow me @PaulNicklen to learn more about the role the sperm whale plays in its ocean environment, as well as how you can make a difference to their survival with @SeaLegacy and me. #ExtinctionEndsHere #Whale #Biology #Funfacts}}]",446141,1525,0.2162915440334268,0.10168829138658746,0.14752959244532318,1
