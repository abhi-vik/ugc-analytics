       "['One of the lucky few: Donner was rescued from a major breeding and cub-petting facility in Colorado—and now thrives at a true sanctuary, @turpentinecreek in Eureka Springs, Arkansas. Many roadside zoos use tiger cubs for bottle feeding, petting, and photo ops—and discard or kill them when they’re too big and dangerous to pet: it’s the dark underbelly of hands-on wildlife tourist attractions. Many are nonprofits and pose as rescues or sanctuaries. This is not conservation: Not one captive-bred tiger has ever been successfully released into the wild! You can find a list of true sanctuaries at the Big Cat Sanctuary Alliance. Our story, “The Tigers Next Door,” appears in the December issue, produced with writer Sharon Guynup.',\n",

       " \"Palm oil plantation, Carey Island, Selangor, Malaysia. Malaysia and Indonesia together produce 85% of the world's palm oil. For a week in Kuala Lumpur, where I'm based, the city has been shrouded in a toxic haze from burning peat forests—set on fire to clear land for palm oil and pulpwood plantations on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The resulting haze can travel as far as neighboring Malaysia and Singapore. Conservation biologist Adam Kamal explains why palm oil is so ubiquitous: It is in almost everything: toothpaste, ice cream, cosmetic creams, and even in some fuels. No other crop produces the same amount of vegetable oil per acre that oil palm does. However, while the productivity of well-maintained oil palm is amazing, the key issues now are the sustainable management of palm oil plantations, monocropping with heavy reliance on chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and expansion of plantations into pristine forest areas. High-quality forests are cut down for a one-off profit, which then eases the leasing of a clear-cut area for oil palm plantations. The key is to use already degraded land or land that aren’t primary forest or healthy secondary forest for these plantations as well as making sure that the supply chain is kept sustainable. Oil palm itself is not evil, but it must be regulated.\"]"
