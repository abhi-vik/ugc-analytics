Beatification,"Batch pH1  Pours a bright, peachy, warm goldenrod. A nice head forms and immediately dies, leaving absolutely no foam. 4  Reminds me of Lost Abbey sours in the nose. Lots of tropical and stone fruits are apparent, possibly derived from the touch of acetobacter present in the ph1 barrel. Sweet, ripe, sun warmed fresh off the tree peaches, minimal phenolic funk. Beautiful. 5  Fresh ripe peaches, must cellar funk, citrus pith bitterness, tangy acetobacter. Age is detectable but this beer is amazing. Holding up well and just fantastic. 4.5  Nice full carbonation, does just fine here. 4  So lucky to be trying this. Really spectacular and worlds better than batch 001. A different beer than future batches, really something special. 5  Batch 002  Pours clear and bright golden, no head. 4  Smells dank and stanky. Marijuana, enteric funk, dirt, tangy nectarines. Incredibly tart, lactic sourness is ridiculous. Damp, musty wood and cellar-ness. 5  Earth, damp oak, lemons (juice and pith), so funky and so sour. This stuff is ridiculous. 4.5  Nice carbonation, leaves your mouth puckered, bone dry, and tannin'd. 4  Fantastic stuff. Really cool try it next to pH1. Way more sour and funky. One of the best American wilds out there. 5  Batch 003, reviewed 12/15/2008, 3 years before the rest of this vertical.  Appearance: It was simply beautiful. I poured it into an almost completely spherical goblet and it looked like a beautiful glowing orb reminiscent of the sun. The head quickly receded, but lasted long enough for me to get some great aroma. 4.5  Smell: Magnificent! Pure cheesy, barnyard, horse blanket funk. I was hoping the flavor would deliver like the scent did... 5  Taste: This was damn good. Super sour lemons initially, then that barnyard funk hits. It finishes with the flavor of a well aged ripe cheese. 5  Mouthfeel: My saliva glands exploded as it hit my mouth. You know when you drink a really gnarly lambic? Yeah, like that. It was crispy yet smooth. It burnt my chapped lips something fierce. Oh yeah. 4.5  Drinkability: I thought I wouldn't want a whole bottle, so I split it with my friend, but I could have sipped on this all night. It was great how the flavor developed as it warmed, and every sip was an explosion of flavor. It probably takes someone who has really acquired the taste of really wild sours to love this, but if you like this style and you get one of the 750ml bottles, keep it to yourself!  Overall, this was a real treat. I wish it was not so expensive, but I will have to get one or two more bottles. This jumped into my top 5 beers. Easily. 4.5  Batch 004. Thanks, Craig.  Pours clear and bright straw with a nice head which recedes into a thin film. 4.5  Smells lemony, funky, powdery, and citric. Smarties also make a guest appearance. 4.5  Lemony and sour at first sip. Musty, damp oak is prominent and lasts long into the finish. This is beatification alright. 4  Mouthfeel is great. Very full from dense carbonation. Light on the palate but not at all too effervescent. 4.5  Good stuff. Less complex and funky than it's predecessors, but I look forward to seeing what it does with age. 4.5",0.6693019178505646,5.0,0.9995
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"I promised not to review anything from Dark Lord Day. There was too much happening. This is my one exception. I had glass after glass because several people kept saying wow that it too hot for me here you want to finish mine. Oh my God what were they thinking. This was the most easy drinking whiskey I have ever had. It is certainly closer to bourbon than to beer. The beer seemed much higher than 13% ABV to me but the hot alcohol had the softness of a 10 - 20 year old bourbon. WOW! Everyone who has been to my house knows that Woodford Reserve is my favorite go-to Bourbon. I am not makin this up for the sake of this review. I always have it on hand. Wouldnt you know, the wonderful geniuses at Three Floyds that hand crafted this beer JUST FOR ME, picked my regular bourbon for aging this beer. Yes, This is Dark Lord, aged for a year in none other than Woodford Reserve Bourbon Barrels. Oh my God! I just about passed out this was so freaking good. I went week in the knees and I was not drunk.  Appearance: When I received this beer in a plastic cup there was no head on it. I poured it into my snifter glass and it stirred up very little head but in the glass it did showcase a nice tan head. Several times through drinking this beer various friend emptied there plastic cups into my snifter each time revitalizing a tiny bit of head in this otherwise murky black body.   Smell: Everything I love about bourbon and more flooded my nose. Rich scent of various woods, just like the Woodford Reserve I makes me think of my freshly moistened humidor. Dark roasted malts and barley, black coffer and thick bitter sweet chocolate and of course a wallop of vanilla oak bourbon flavors.  Taste: The biggest complaint people had on this hot day was the beer is too much like bourbon. If that is the biggest gripe, then gripe on my friends. I LOVE IT! This is absolutely everything I could ever want in a drink. It is the best of both world. It is what I love about two different drinks met in one glass. Yes the alcohol does not hide. So you sip the beer like you would any other liquor. It takes drinking it differently than a more typical beer but it is certainly worth it. The dark chocolate malts and fruits blend right into the woody vanilla oak and somehow it creates what feels like very layers of flavors and leaves your mouth with the feel of bourbon on the tongue and throat and face.  Mouthfeel: The swallow is very hot but the massive rich oily smooth feel coats every inch of your mouth and then some. I can feel the hot alcohol and warm boozy black grains making my face go numb as works its way from my tongue to my cheeks, my tonsils and up through my sinuses until my whole face seems to going flush enjoying the magnificence that this masterpiece exudes.   Drinkability: When I sit down with my favorite liquor I dont start just putting them back one after another. Drinkability is the duration for which I can enjoy that drink. I would take it slowly, but I could enjoy this dink all day long.  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",0.5866006116901251,5.0,0.9994
Peche 'n Brett,"E: Beeswax coated pry-off crown cap. Purchased at a bodega in Brooklyn for a wallet-annihilating $40.00 USD. 1 pint 9.4 fl oz brown glass. Orange colourful label art. Bottle #20020. Best by 10/2020. ' 10% ABV. ""Oak aged organic ale brewed with peaches."" Brewed with peaches and brettanomyces. ""Final refermentation with pear juice.""  Expectations are extremely high given my love for the brewery and this beer's presence on the top 250 beers list.  HEAD: ~3 fingers worth of white head. Frothy, creamy, gorgeously soft, and of great complexion. Consistency is terrific. Retention is excellent - ~8+ minutes.  BODY: Pale murky orange of okay vibrance. I see no yeast or sediment within, but it definitely appears unfiltered.  Appears well-carbonated. It's a nice looking beer and captures the lively unfiltered look of a great saison, but I can't say the vibrance of the body colour is on par with that of the best expressions of the style.  AROMA: Soft orchard peaches, orange sherbert, soft juicy pear, creamy notes, pale malts. The soft luscious peach is impeccable, elevating this aroma easily to world class level. Promises a juicy peachy genuine brew with absurd depth and expressiveness of flavour.  Any oak is too subdued to be noticeable. Sweetness/bitterness balance seems perfect. Nectary juicy goodness is the highlight of this aroma; I'm salivating just awaiting the first sip.  Aromatic intensity is perfect (mild to moderate).  No overt hop notes; maybe some seamless fruity tones. Yeast character has an incredibly subtle funky bend without distracting. As soft and delicate an aroma as they come.  No off-notes or overt alcohol.  TASTE & TEXTURE: Creamy soft peach, smacky lactic tartness (was the brettanomyces used lambicus? This is straight-up sour), evocative expressive orchard peach, soft juicy luscious pear, subtle yeasty dryness (bringing just enough to coax more depth of flavour out of this brew without making it drag on the palate), and creamy peach sherbert.  Hides its 10% ABV angelically well, hiding any alcohol beneath layers of billowing softness. Couldn't be more delicate or gentle on the palate. Perfectly smacky on the palate, making the slight tart sourness sing. Comfortingly soft. This mouthfeel may be perfect; rarely do I encounter such harmony of softness, fragility, and body. It's so light it's insanely drinkable, it's aptly smooth and wet, and carbonation is perfect.  Malt backbone melts into the dominant fruity tones, letting them take the spotlight. This is as gestalt a flavour profile as I've ever encountered, blending every constituent note together in a layered cohesive way, elevating the whole above the sum of its parts. The peach sings.   Noticeable acidity.  Sourness is maybe a 4/10, which is ideal for a saison in my view. It lacks any drying funkiness, and there aren't too many fruity esters mucking with the fruity focus of the brew. Balance is perfect. Depth of flavour is excellent. Duration of flavour is high for the style. Intensity of flavour is moderate. I can't get enough of this stuff.  OVERALL: Logsdon outdoes themselves with this stellar brew. This is possibly the best saison I've had from any brewery in North America, and I can't vet its quality enough. It's earned its position on the current top 250 list, and I'd heartily recommend it to any discerning drinker - even at its seemingly obscene $40/bottle price. When I think of true perfection in terms of texture, this beer will be amongst the first to pop into my head. Its juicy softness accentuates the peach emphasis of the brew beautifully. Awingly good - ineffably so. Just fuckingly delicious. I find myself inhaling this and simultaneously being shocked by its 10% - how is this so effortlessly drinkable at that high an ABV?  Nitpicky as I am with great beers, I have to admit I struggle to find many issues with this aside from petty things like appearance. At a certain point, excellence becomes undeniable.  This is what we talk about when we talk about beer as art.  Low A+ (4.71) / MUST TRY (WORLD CLASS)  *** 07.26.17 2nd impressions from a batch # 27857 bottle:  Less sour/tart than the last bottle I tried. A little less balanced, with too much sweetness.

Sure Bet,"Currently #175 in the Top 250 beers list and #5 in the Top Illinois state beers list.  BOTTLE: Purchased at a Trader Joe's in Chicago, IL for $9.99 USD plus tax. 22 fl oz bomber format. Brown glass. Branded red pry-off crown cap. In true Pipeworks tradition, the label art/design is loud and colourful. No bottle date.  9.50% ABV. ""Imperial India Pale Ale brewed with honey and mango puree."" ""Citra and Mosaic hopped IIPA."" ""Unfiltered.""  Served cold.  HEAD: ~3cm in height. Off-white colour. Average frothiness and creaminess. Consistency is fairly soft but could be more robust. Good retention for its high ABV - ~4 minutes (fairly impressive at 9.50% ABV). No lacing adheres to the sides of the glass as the head recedes.  BODY: This is unfiltered? I wouldn't guess to look at it...it's as clear as can be; I can read the bottle label through the beer. Golden copper of average to above average vibrance. Clean, lacking any visible yeast/lees, sediment, or haziness.  Appears well-carbonated. Not unique or special for an Imperial IPA in terms of appearance, but certainly well within style conventions and generally enticing.  AROMA: The honeyed malt sweetness plays brilliantly alongside the vibrant blueberry from the Mosaic hops and the tropical citrusy vibe of the Citra. Mango I had to look for, if only because Citra and Mosaic bring so much other tropical fruit to the table...tangerine, orange, mandarin orange, maybe some guava. Has some nectary and floral aromatics as well.  Hop pungency could be better, but the honey and mango puree sweetness along with pale malts help cover any booziness in addition to muting the hops. It has a warmth to it, but no overt booze.  Fruity ale yeast esters blend in to the fruity hop aromatics seamlessly.  I find no off-notes.  Suggests a balanced and enjoyable imperial IPA with an interesting hop profile and nice honey sweetness but limited depth of flavour. The use of honey adjunct invites comparisons to Bell's Hopslam, and from what I recall I prefer the aroma of that beer. Still, I'm eager to give this a go.  TASTE & TEXTURE: Soft, full-bodied, somewhat thick, smooth, wet, not unrefreshing...frankly I expected a much boozier mouthfeel given its 9.50% ABV. This might be dangerous.  Nectary and a bit juicy, accentuating the tropical fruit nicely. Tangerine, mango, passionfruit, guava, mandarin orange. The Mosaic character is less the subtle blueberry I usually love from that hop and more the vague tropical fruit vibe that you can coax out of many new world hops...why use Mosaic if you're not going to commit to what makes it unique?  Sweetness isn't too much, which is always a risk in a honey adjunct imperial IPA (especially one also brewed with mango puree). The additional sources of sugar haven't harmed the beer's perceived sweetness or attenuation; this is a dialed-in brew even if it could use more expressiveness and pungency in terms of hop flavour. The constituent hop notes aren't as vivid or pronounced as one would expect in a truly world class expression of the style, but the beer's balance is pretty impressive in spite of its relative shallowness.  Not oily, gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, harsh, rough, or scratchy, though there is a bit of alcohol warmth that isn't unpleasant.  Well built for the style, no doubt. Flavour duration is above average. Flavour intensity is average.  Well-carbonated.  OVERALL: More drinkable than it has any right to be at 9.50% ABV, Sure Bet is true to its title, delivering plenty of interesting hop flavour, a healthy alcohol wallop, and impressive balance. In terms of imperial IPAs brewed with honey, I'd much sooner take Bell's Hopslam, which is not only better but less expensive. I'd like to see Pipeworks ditch the cash-grab bomber format and put this out in 4 packs for the same price; otherwise, I doubt I'd buy it again in spite of its obvious quality. It's hard to go wrong with Citra and Mosaic, but the popularity of those hops (particularly of late) has resulted in many breweries coaxing more of their nuanced flavour out of them than Pipeworks has managed to with this ale. Indeed, the ""Sure Bet"" in Sure Bet may well be its hop combination.  I'll enjoy polishing off the bottle, but as tasty as it is I can't say it's one of the best 250 beers worldwide, even if it is one of the better expressions of the style I've had from an Illinois brewery. More solid work from Pipeworks, and absolutely well worth trying if you can stomach its ~50c/oz price. That said, most discerning drinkers are better off saving their hard-earned money for something like Hopslam.  High B (3.71) / GOOD",0.7064664034295508,4.0,0.9993
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Presentation: Managed to snaffle two bottles of this; one was a present from my good friend BA RichLightWeight, but I also managed to buy a further bottle at Quinns in London NW1 (see BeerFly). 37,5cl green glass bottle with dimpled base. Sealed with a thumbed cork which is retained by a black metal cap and cage. All this is wrapped in black foil around the top 3 of the bottles neck. Light yellow colored main label with the generic 3 Fonteinen logo on it. Labeled as Oude Geuze with the word Vintage in white text set against a brown background below. Large date on the side of the label 07 / 03 / 2002. Listed at Alc. 6% Vol.  Appearance: Golden orange, slightly turbid at first but it soon clears to reveal a crystal clean body. Gueuze like frothy head races high with a gentle audible fizz as it settles down. The head has excellent retention, the carbonation is medium in strength but the long term resilience of the conditioning is very high, it pumps out a constant forceful rising set of streamers right until the last drop. Superb presentation, there is nothing wrong with this one.  Nose: Classic Drie Fonteinen nose with a simply orgasmic Gueuze nose. Dry acerbic nose has a soft farmyard heritage but this is punctuated with dry white grape skins and some cold tannin. Earthy tones with damp oak, sharp acetic tangents and a full body in the nostrils. Utterly charming stuff, has a biting nose at first but it also has a mature rounded edge to it. Perfect.  Taste: This Gueuze has a superb balance to it, this is what strikes me right from the off!! Gorgeous astringency pulls at the cheeks as the base lambics add to the experience, this is all lambic here! Soft yet sharp, dry yet wheaty, the beginning complements the finish and entices you to start all over again. High rise dryness in the finish could be too much for some, the sour grapefruit and grape skins add fruit to this anhydric experience and balance it nicely though. I find this characteristic to be a distinctive trademark finish in the older Oude Gueuze of Drie Fonteinen and very attractive. Incredible stuff, all the hard work has been done for the Imbiber, good to go right now but I bet this one will get even better with a few more years under its belt.  Mouthfeel: Bold feel with a big body. The intense carbonation feels like it shot blasts the cheeks, as this tingling rescinds the flavors fill the void, but after the swallow the finish is pure ball-clenching dryness that pulls the cheeks in, but it is not over the top as in some younger examples, this one has a defined mature dryness. Quality stuff.  Drinkability: Im a huge fan of Gueuze so it is no surprise that this small 375ml bottle was drained bone dry in no time. A very refreshing Gueuze it complemented the hot 4th July here in Long Bach with little effort. Lovers of Armand Debelders dry yet grapefruit grape skin filled creations will surely love this one.   Overall: Superb!! A terrifically balanced and weathered Oude Gueuze that shows why stashing fresh samples away can be such a reward. Guess I will not see this one again, shame, I wish I had picked up more now! Thanks to my good mate BA RichLightWeight for the gift of this, and pointing me towards picking up another.  Highly Recommended.",0.6887400518721596,5.0,0.9992
Oude Geuze Vintage,"2002 red label wale edition consumed Oct 2010.  Pours a half finger of white head. Color is a cloudy golden orange with a lot of active carbonation.  Aroma: A big amount of funk to this one. Oak and sour fruits. Lemon citrus again, which I find common in the 3F gueuzes. Horseblanket and straw. Some sourness to this one.  Taste: I think I like this one better than Millennium, but it has a light medicinal flavor to it and is a bit drier. A nice dried fruit profile. Apples and pears. Lemon zest and acidity again. It is funky and has a basement musk to it.  Mouthfeel: Fizzy in a good way, sour, and tart. Light to medium bodied with a bit higher amount of carbonation. Ends really dry.

Madagascar,"Poured from the bottle into a large snifter glass. Vintage 2015.  Deep walnut brown body with a hint of clarity around the edges. Small basic tan head, with little retention and can't quite make a finger. Settles to a creamy but even bubbles collar, and a little bit of lacing.  Aroma is quite impressive. Huge thick chocolate notes, and Duncan Hines cake batter. There's a hint of coffee roast in here, a bit of char as well as the roast character really pipes out just a little bit as well. Extremely impressive nose, with a bit of powder cocoa mixing in as well. Like a warm inviting bakers chocolate cake even with the matching icing, and a small cup of coffee. Very impressive.  One word. Wow. Where do I start? For a brew that seems to be fairly straightforward this is incredibly diverse on the palate. Thick rich and balanced, the light bodied quality opens up tremendously on first sip. Coffee light acid then a thick mixing cake like milk chocolate and vanilla sweetness fills the palate. Blasting char roast on the finish, and even in the mid palate as well, with some great amounts of dry roast porter like tones, and coffee bean grinds. Nice wonderful toned lactose sweetness with cream and vanilla complimenting perfectly, each of these roast, dry, sweet, and chocolate notes are just all paired together wonderfully. Aftertaste takes more of the sweetness away perfectly, almost cigar breath and coffee like quality. Oaky whiskey notes really seem to have just sat in the dust and given all their power to the other elements in sweetness and vanilla. There's no booze on this whatsoever either.  This doesn't even taste like a milk stout, and it's absolutely flooring. Drinks so incredibly easily, a great creation.",0.6962347245417412,5.0,0.9992
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Vintage 2018-  drank at fridge temp; drank to room temp.  Appearance- dark black body. Dark brown head. head pours a full 1 fingers tall. Great head retention. finally drops down to thick cap. Thick lacing on the glass after each sip.  Smell: Hefty vanilla & top shelf bourbon intertwined with musty / mature oak. Fudge and Umami. Roasted malt & a hint of oatmeal.   Taste: Perfect balance of sweet, rich, and roasty. Huge vanilla almost like marshmallows; perfectly dialed in vanilla flavor. Top shelf bourbon. Assertive roasted malt in the best possible way. Sophisticated oak barrel character; musty, oaky, charred, and deep; complexity goes on for days & days. Hint of tobacco & leather. Perfect blending of dark chocolate and fudge flavors. I don't honestly know how this could be much better.   Mouthfeel: full body. low carbonation that is dialed into where it needs to be almost to the point of perfection. Very, very smooth barrel aged stout. Not a hint of booze.   Overall: This is rich stout barrel juice! Holy Shit! The 2017 vintage of barrel aged Expedition Stout was very good, but the 2018 vintage is near flawless. It is going to be hard to cellar this beer. It drinks perfectly right now. This beer makes me happy because it is like rediscovering bourbon county from the 12oz format all over again, except this time the discerning palate knows just how incredible this beer really is! Bells hit a grand slam home run with 2018 BBA Expedition. This is easily the finest bourbon barrel aged stout without adjuncts that I have drank from a 4 pack / 12oz bottle format. It easily blows away all the best 12oz vintages of regular Bourbon County Stout. I haven't had a barrel aged stout blow me away like this since 2009 bourbon county brand stout & I think this is miles ahead of that vintage of Bourbon County. Bells brewery, take my money until I am completely flat broke. This is the perfect storm of extremely high quality bourbon barrel aged stout in the proper format (4pk of 12oz bottles). I will impulse buy this beer all day long without hesitation.   Vintage 2017-  Appearance: dark black body. Dark brown head. head pours a full 3 fingers tall. Great head retention. finally drops down to thick cap.  Smell: Heavy oak char. Sweet and rich bourbon; stronger notes of caramel, vanilla, and tobacco with a hinting of coconut. Very roasty malt profile.   Taste: Its got that big roasted malt character of Expedition stout first. Then you get a nice balance from aggressive bourbon barrel notes. Charred oak, earthy oak barrel, smoke, leather, caramel, and vanilla. As you sip the beer melds together midpalate and into the finish. You start to taste dark fruits and a hint of black licorice that evolve as your palate gets used to the huge roasted malt with big barrel notes. A lightly spicy whiskey sting and tobacco/molasses/leather combo round out the finish with a lightly bitter roast presence.   Mouthfeel: This is on the higher end of medium bodied beer which gets close to full bodied, but its not quite motor oil thick. Low carbonation that is perfectly dialed in. The body of this barrel aged stout is impressively creamy. Which really enhances your experience of this beer and improves the overall effect.   Overall: The battle of robust and roast stout VS. very aggressive and flavorful barrel notes. I think the malt profile of expedition is the beast that still dominates as the strongest flavor in this beer. The in your face barrel aging is quite nice as well. This is the more edgy version of black note. Its really hard to say if I enjoy black note or barrel aged expedition stout more. One thing is for sure that Bells makes two great barrel aged beers in the 12oz format which is very nice. I will enjoy following both these barrel aged stout offering from Bells as long as they will sell it. They are both two of Michigan's ""finer"" barrel aged stout offerings in the state.

Peche 'n Brett,"Thanks to anadune for this one, super high up there on my ""wants"" list, glad to finally see this one go. I love peaches and I love Brett, so this beer should do me well. Pours a brilliant sunburst color with hints of golden-peach flowing about. Cloudy and opaque for the most part with a foamy white head that has decent retention.  Whoof! Talk about funk! The aroma hits hard, right out of the gate, and doesn't let up. Copious amounts of Brett just unleash and unload on the senses - barnyard funk, damp cellar, and wet hay. And then, of course, the peaches! There's a vibrant peach presence that underlines the funky body of the beer - it's sweet, juicy, and authentic, and perhaps most importantly - it's not overdone at all. Rather than control or overtake the aroma, the peaches just accent it, and inject their juicy goodness in a moderate but noticeable amount, a nearly perfect complement to the barnyard funk. Sweet and funky all at once - how can you not love that? The oak can be found once you ""search"" for it, and once you find it, it doesn't go away. Beautiful woody tones round out this excellently aromatic profile. Exquisite.  I couldn't have been more excited to finally bring this one to my lips... as soon as it hits my palate, the funk just plants itself in my mouth and never lets go. This bitch is SUPER funky; tons of barnyard, horsey sweat, musty earth, cheesy-funk... Absolutely crazy. The oak makes a big comeback and tastes much more robust than it smelled - works perfectly with the insane amounts of Brett that are going wild right now. And then again - just like an epiphany similar to the aroma - the peaches just squeeze their way in, quietly and unobtrusively, adding just the right amount of presence and flavor. Seriously, they could not have been added to this beer in a more perfect amount. Enough to tame the Brett and keep your taste buds working, but not enough to overpower and turn this thing into a peach cobbler.  I wouldn't necessarily describe this beer as ""sour"", but there certainly is a light tartness that hits you initially with the onslaught of Brett. By the time the peaches take the forefront, the tartness will have faded and the beer takes on a lovely sweetness that nicely combines with (and is probably aided by) the peach flavors. My friend and I were surprised to find out this beer was clocking in at 10% ABV - there's just no possible way that much alcohol can be masked so well. Honestly, this drinks just as easily as the Cantillon and Drie Fonteinen gueuzes we had previously, and those contain nearly half the alcohol. Peche n' Brett has a medium body; sharp, slick, and wet mouth feel with a medium-high amount of carbonation.  Wow, what a truly unique and amazing beer. Perfect amount of peaches and a nice compliment to their wonderful Brett profile. I thought this one was a huge improvement over the Seizoen Bretta (although that was still very good). Took me by surprise, but I hope I'll have the chance to enjoy this one again. Top notch.",0.6623930154398531,4.75,0.9992
Beatification,"375ml, batch 005 (bottled 1/10/2012), poured into a Russian River stemmed snifter today- proper glassware-, 9/2/2013. Thanks to Brian for throwing this in as an extra. Best extra I've ever gotten. Review #179.  This beer pours a beautiful clear golden straw body, same colour as the label, with a 1cm white frothy head that persists for a very long time. Its a very pretty looking beer, typical of Russian River. In fact, this reminds me of Sanctification.  The scent is basically straight up sourness. Lemon acidity. Smelling this beer- its so damn sour that my teeth starts getting eaten away, and I haven't even put this beer in my mouth yet. It is so acidic, vinegary sour that it burns the hell out of my Cranial Nerve 1 (the nerve responsible for our sense of smell). There is a nice woody, brett funky presence underlying this beer too. This is literally the sourest smelling beer I've ever had.. but deliciously so- there is nothing off-putting about this nose at all.  And man, this beer strips the enamel off my teeth. This is so damn sour. Even more sour than sucking on a ripe lemon. So mouthpuckeringly sour, it burns the hell out of my palate. We had Blind Pig, Pliny the Elder, etc. that same night, and you would think our palate is destroyed. But I can still taste the sourness on the back of my palate, like 5 beers later. So sour, its amazing. It's got a good bit of zesty citrus sweetness that somehow balances out the sour so that it's not unpleasant at all. I don't know how Russian River does it, but they somehow made a beer that is way more sour than even highly concentrated vinegar yet is so pleasurable to drink.   The mouthfeel on this is basically a medium bodied blonde with awesome carbonation and the most damn sour aftertaste. Its like my palate got stung the heck out of it, so now its expressing a permanent sour burn here. I get tons of heart burn from this beer... its so damn sour, its perfect. The only note here is that a mere 375ml bottle is going to be pretty tough to take down on your own.  This is the most sour beer I've ever had. I can't imagine it being any more sour. I thought Sanctification and Sour in the Rye were the sourest beers that I've had, but this one far outstrips them. Its such an amazing beer, perfect for sharing with 1 friend. And that friend had better be a good one! Highly recommend. Nice job Russian River, this beer is worth everything anyone would ever give up for it. Thanks again Brian, for extra'ing me an amazing beer.  Re-review: 375ml bottle of batch 006, bottled in 9/13/2013, opened today, 2/13/2014 at Voodoo Brewery. Poured into a Voodoo snifter. 5 months old. In contrast to the 19 month old batch 005, this one is a lot more complex and slightly less sour. More lemon, citrus, oak, white pepper in the nose as well as on the palate. Acidity is still there, at 7/10 while batch 005 was more of a 9/10. Just enough to make this incredibly mouthpuckering but without overcoming all the different complexities in the flavour. Highly recommend drinking fresh within a year for the full bouquet of flavours to enjoy.  Re-re-review, but not quite: 375ml genie bottle of PH1, served in a snifter glass 9/6/2015. Pours a darker, hazy orange body, a slight straw-pink hue, one finger white head with good retention, dropping into a medium collar. No lacing. Smells of orange zest, lemon, a lot of oak, funk, minerals. Gueuze-like in many ways. Significantly restrained acidity compared to fresher batches, more of the citrus. Flavour is very complex; more so than fresh Beat. Oak, funk, cobwebs, lemon, citrus, mild orange peel. Very clean and refined, yet still aggressive enough to provide that ""wow"" moment. It's done very well with time. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, softer carbonation, reasonably mouthpuckering oaky finish, clean. Overall- this is extremely tasty for such an old bottle. This batch of Beatification has done quite well and has added more complexity with time.  Yet another batch-related review- 375ml bottle of batch 007 bottled 3/25/2015; poured in a Russian River goblet glass on 11/14/2015. Pours a slightly hazy straw yellow body, hues of gold, fluffy one finger white head with nice retention, not much lacing. Eventually goes still as it always does. Smells of oak, an intense cobweb mustiness, a ton of acetic acid, lemon, a bit of earth. It's very acidic smelling fresh. The palate is similarly acetic, with a nice lemony bite, classic Beatification right there. Oak as well, cobwebs. It's not as funky as its Belgian counterparts, but apparently that comes with time (per PH1, anyway). Mouthfeel is there, medium bodied, good carbonation, refreshingly sour but with a slightly astringent orange peel that is a bit more astringent than in batches past. Might need some time to round out the edges; perhaps that's why Vinnie held back this release for so long. That being said, it's now drinking as well as it should be!",0.6731600381528431,4.75,0.9991
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"12oz bottle - dated 10/16/18 - poured into a snifter after sitting in the snow a bit too long.   Pours the utmost deepest shade of dark brown, just shy of being pitch black. Pours headless, and then suddenly, like an apparition, half a finger of mocha head forms over the top, lasting for less than a minute before disappearing into the shadowy depths again, leaving little behind, but a frothy tan collar, and a swirly film.  Nose - Dear god. I have died and gone to heaven. I mean holy barrel-aged jesus. Where do I even begin? Hot cocoa mix powder. Bourbon. Vanilla. Caramel. All wrapped up and in your face. It's truly remarkable. Cake batter, chocolate frosting, whiskey and cream. Ancient oak, magical bourbon barrels, priceless leather. Milk chocolate covered cherries, figs, pralines, under-baked brownies. 50 year old bourbon. I can't stop smelling it. I've never given any category of anything a 5, because I've been saving that bar. This is it. The nose on this is the 5 I've been waiting for.  Palate: I need to lower my expectations after that nose, so I'm not disappointed. Okay. Here we go...  Oh my god. It's the nose personified. Need I repeat myself? Hot cocoa mix powder, fudge, bourbon, vanilla, oak, milk chocolate, chocolate covered espresso beans, fudge, fresh leather, brown sugar, Irish cream, a hint of maple, a hint of molasses, a kiss of boozy bourbon, the faintest wisp of smoky char in the finish, and truly, a touch of magic. Divine. Fairly sweet up front and through the middle, but never cloying, and then concluded nicely with the ever-so-slightly charred oak semi-dryness. Flavors dancing and transforming from start to finish, and continue to transform well after. Beautiful.   Mouthful is full, rich, slightly sticky, ever-so-sliiigghhttlllly thick and viscous (imagine a thin viscosity), bold, heavy, yet still beautifully liquid. Lovingly coats the palate in a sweet, delicious, bourbon-infused film, and then as-slow-as-glaciers, manifests into a rich, drier charred chocolate oak spirit, that stays and haunts you in such a beautiful manner. One need only take another sip to see the sweet, vibrant life from within reappear before your very palate. A fine, but very discernable carbonation is present, to remind you that this is still a being of the beer realm.  Overall: Man, I was so hesitant to grab this, at nearly $9 for a 12oz bottle. One of the only beers I can think of that's worth every penny of a huge asking price. This isn't just a beer. This is an experience. One to savor for as long as possible. This is a freshly bottled batch. I can't imagine what some age would do to this. It's incredible as is - dare I say...perfect? This is one of the extremely rare few beers that has truly blown my mind. Tree House Julius was one. Allagash Belfius was one. This...this is a work of art. Magnificence. Liquid divinity. World-class? Now that's an understatement.",0.6392106414175952,4.75,0.999
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"375ml Bottle  This one come's my way courtesy of Dave! Thanks a million, guy!This beer is black. No shadows, no hints of anything, just black. The foam is a little hard to get going but it rose as I finished pouring. The head grew to a thin cap, shy of a finger in height, and was the color of milk chocolate. A thin ring remains with a tiny island traversing the surface. Thin drink lines are left after each drink. This beer looks and acts like an 11% porter.  Oh, man. The nose on this beer is decadent. A big ol' flash of pecans gets the ball rolling. Burnt sugar and molasses join he fray shortly thereafter. There's a moderate roast in the middle high cocoa content chocolate, rich yet bordering on bitter. I don't get a ton of maple but the barrel aging was deftly handled. The barrel aspects compliment, instead of overtake, by wrapping the base beer in an embrace of toasted marshmallow, damp oak, and rich caramel. I love the toasted marshmallow quaility when pulled from barrels.  While the nose was very good, the flavor actually tops it. Walnut and pecan in the flavor, a nice nutty start. Burnt sugars and molasses again in the middle. This follows the nose fairly closely but the components are more well integrated. Dark chocolate picks up mid palate and pushes through to the finish where it's met with those fantastic barrel characteristics; toasted marshmallow sweetness, tannic bourbon soaked oak, and rich caramel. A soft peppery heat wraps it up. There are no hard edges. This is an outstanding sipper of a beer.  The body is lighter than expected yet works amazingly well. It's a couple ticks above moderate in weight with a really soft, velvety feel. It literally feels like velvet. The carbonation is dialed in perfectly. There's a little sweetness on the swallow but it's in no way cloying. Alcohol fumes get exhaled through the nose but there's no heat on the swallow. Excellent.  Bourbon Barrel Black Maple is a really outstanding beer from Jackie O's. It's rich and decadent, silky and smooth, flat out delicious. The brewers did a great job with the barrel aging and integration. They pull out all the best characteristics of the barrel while keeping the actual beer at center stage. This is some great stuff. Thanks, Dave!",0.6750782146212864,4.25,0.999
Society & Solitude #4,"Enjoyed on tap at Armsby Abbey in Worcester, MA.   A - Familiar HF hazy, golden, orangeish-yellow, straw color with three finger head with great lacing and retention. Beautiful.  S - Sweet, hoppy, fruit juice with some mellow tropical mango, pineapple balanced with sharp grapefruit citrus. pretty amazing. Hint of malt, but that's it.   T - Wow! wonderful flavor profile. You get fresh, juicy hop notes from orange & grapefruit to pineapple, mango and even banana! I've never tasted a banana like note -- delicious! Really nice balance of bitterness and sweetness throughout with a lingering finish. There is a slight pale malt presence, but easily outshined by the glorious hop juice!   M - Incredibly drinkable, especially with a medium to full body. Very robust, bursting with flavor. Great carbonation. Alcohol well hidden. As each sip lingered on the palate, it left great anticipation for the next.   O - Delicious and most enjoyable. Having sampled many of HF's DIPAs, I have perhaps even unrealistic expectations when I taste a new one. This beer delivered. It's high on the top favorites list for me. I enjoyed #4 more than either Double Citra or Double Galaxy on their own. A world class beer. So drinkable, fresh and refreshing, you could enjoy outside on a summer day, lazily passing conversation, pour after pour. Yet so equally delicious and interesting, you could savor each sip as if it were the last. I feel this is where Mr. Hill solves the Double IPA equation. Achieving the perfect combination of wonderfully interesting, unique and delicate flavor profiles that are equally as approachable, inviting, and drinkable. Well done.",0.7183094311019238,5.0,0.999
Green,"My dad showed up today. He's on a modified car circuit race team. Travels around New England. He brought me this little gem. 16oz.can with a coozy!!. He told me, the line of people waiting for canned take home pours was long.  (* Second can update. ""The action is Go !"" is the statement on the bottom of the can. Canned on: 11/10/17 opened, the next day 11/11/17. Update on notes =* slight update on 12/13 after bringing home many from the brewery. Bottom of can : "" Go see the volcanoes, Go see the rainforests"" 12/12/17 *** 3rd can update. 9/19/18. Opened on 9/28/18. Slight notes and adjustements.. )  Galaxy hops, man o man. Righteous hop. Herbal, dry earth, sweet fruity layers in both aroma and flavor. Reminds me very much of the mega complex Heady Topper. Seriously, the layers of flavor just keeps riding in. Giant, earthy, spicy, citric tropical blend of hop wonder!! The malt is also in perfect balance and very bold.  Seriously enjoyable quoff. Easier on the pallet, but Still, each gulp held something new. The hop/malt balance being in the Heady topper levels. Top shelf quality....what a sweet surprise. Thanks pops.   Balance is amazing and the drinkability is very high. Complexity is multi layered but easy breezy..... Tropical fruits but hig earthy tones as well. Major league complexity with multiple layers of flavor that just keeps coming!  I had never heard of this brewery until today. Sweet surprise. Massive enjoyment. Thanks pops!!/////  * 11/11/17 can : + 12/13/17 addition. A classic NE ipa look, muddy gold color but bright! , thick and creamy white foam, good lace and well retained. Very intricate, full civerage style lacing.   The aroma....dense fruity hops, big pine and spruce tree effect, pineapple and a very sweetp citrus/pineapple with earthy and interesting malty caramel sweetness aromatics underneath. The American and Australian hop variety combo sure gives off a wonderful, complex smell. Light mango, kiwi and starfruit way down deep.  The multi colored layers of hop complexity is mind blowing. The earthy, natural grassy tones are soooo green! The tropical and mild citrus, light and sweet , peppery malt....just goes on and on! Such a unique and fresh hop taste, only wet hop styles compare. This one has only been in the can for 24 hours, so its about as fresh and green as it gets. There are subtle notes of white wine, chardonnay, green apples and spruce tips.   The mouthfeel, the texture, the body....fresh, crisp, full, lush, smooth and juicy. Righteous all around. Greeeen is the color!! An American cult classic.  *** 9/28/18 review update:   I've realized, overtime that this is the ultimate New England IPA look. The white-hued haze to the otherwise golden color is bright but totally opaque.  The foam heady head, is creamy thick, pure white with about as much solid clumps of lace you can possibly obtain.   The nose is a thing of pure olfactory beauty. Sweetest mango>pine>cantalope>Whipped cream and bright citrus zest aroma has me convinced that Green holds the record for ""overall stankiest hop"" in a beer award.   The righteous texture and mouthfeel will blow you away! Crisp, healthy, smooth, creamy....it's so damn silky. Oooh lala!  Only Heady Topper can compare to the kind of flavor complexity, with infinate layers of hop depth and fine malty balance that Green always delivers.  Green transformed what the New England ipa style is. The bright but deep vibe, complex pine>citrus and earthy tones keeps you curious about every sip. Feelin' it !",0.7218905064301199,4.75,0.999
Sang Noir,"750ml brown glass bottle with appealing label design and unbranded hood-and-wire cap over a cork purchased from Cascade and served cold into a tulip in high altitude Castle Rock, Colorado.   Reviewed live as a sour ale per the label. Expectations are sky high; this is currently #91 on the Top 250 and Cascade is a wonderful brewery. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  No bubble show forms as it's poured.  HEAD: 2 fingers wide. Has one of the richest complexions I've ever seen. Bubbly. Fairly creamy. Decently thick. Retains very well - for ~10 minutes. Leaves no lacing on the sides as it recedes.  BODY: Dark rich sanguine red. Exquisite.  Appears well-carbonated. Looks exactly as it should.  AROMA: Subtle hints of vanilla and oak. Pie crust. Cherry pie. Sour cherries. I could use more tartness from the cherry, but it's nice as-is. Dampened oak. Cream.  A pleasant aroma of average strength. Sourness is mild - at best a 4/10 in terms of intensity. Seems sterile and clinical, and evokes only pure lactobacillus - no true wild or spontaneous bacteria (i.e. lambicus).  TASTE: Sour cherries dominate - and boy is the sourness and tartness ramped up compared to the aroma - easily a 7-8/10, with plenty of lactobacillus bacterial pucker. Oak is present throughout, lending it a guiding cohesion. A bit of subtle vanilla does come through, but no bourbon; I'd never pick up on any bourbon character if I tried this blind. Some vinegary characteristics. Toastiness. Barrel sugars.  The base beers were well-selected; I get some nice acetic character reminiscent of Rodenbach and rich red malt characteristics.  The cherry pie flavour is wonderful, and is the highlight of the beer for me.  Impeccably balanced. This tastes like a gestalt whole, but it's not without room for improvement: more sourness and tartness, richer white oak, and more of a true wild taste would help.  No alcohol or off-notes come through. A minority of drinkers may find the cherry slightly medicinal, but I love it.  TEXTURE: Full-bodied, surprisingly thick for a sour - evoking pie crust, smooth, wet, slightly overcarbonated, damp, oddly refreshing, and rich. It's smacky and acidic on the palate. To its credit, this is one of the few truly puckering beers I've had.  Not oily, gushed, hot, astringent, boozy, harsh, rough, or scratchy.  OVERALL: 9.5% ABV is high for a sour, but it's hardly noticeable here. I get too lost in the flavours to notice it. Great as this beer is, it isn't worth its high pricetag more than once. I'd recommend that every beer enthusiast try this once, but while excellent it isn't world-class, and it isn't substantially better than something like New Belgium's La Folie or Rodenbach's Grand Cru (offerings which are half the price of this one and much more widely available). The pie crust and sour cherry work together brilliantly, lending this fantastic brew some incredible harmony. But there's room for improvement still.  Low A-  --- 12.23.14: Truncated impressions:  Just a great overall beer. An incredible beer in the style with amazing sourness and a great overall flavour profile. Wonderfully acetic.  High A-",0.7240683476396715,4.5,0.999
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Understand that I HAVE to review this at the moment. What I've gone through is too glorious for words. I had the immense opportunity to have the most generous friends possible purchase a 1999 vintage of this at Mikkeller Bar SF tonight for my birthday. What would I do without lovely people in the world? Split 4 ways into wine glasses out of a 750ml bottle.  Just like an old darker red wine, it's impressive what 14 years can do to a oude gueuze. Not nearly as clear or golden-amber tone, this vintage is a solid amber orange that I've never before seen in the style, no doubt due to the sediment settling and fading away over the long period of time that this has gone through. There's an amazingly present amount of carbonation on this, leading up to a frothy head about 2 fingers tall that recedes rather quickly, yet provides sparks in its age. Very syrupy looking at this point, but definitely ranging on wine territory. Not too viscous - only very well placed and assembled.  The aroma is fabulous, as I'd expect - notes of white grape must, apricots, light cherries, and peaches, which then meld into a woody, musty flavor that is unbelievably complex yet not grating in any manner. Notes of oak are very strong on this, almost to the point of pungent, but they meld into other woody complex aromas such as cedar and cherry. Lively, but definitely the equivalent of entering an old, stone-filled, woody building, and the finish is definitely more mineral-y than fruity overall. No severe form of lactic or acetic acidic phenolic aroma here - only beautiful, well formed balanced between the dried stone fruits and musty, yet highly aromatic woodiness.  As for the flavor? Holy shit! (Pardon the language for a moment.) This is fantastic - up there with one of the greatest I've ever had. Right at the front of the tongue, you get strong notes of sour white grapes, as well as apricot, and soured cherries. Then, as soon as the fruits fade away, there's a straw, barnyard pungent flavor, that envelops into bright, vivid woody notes of mahogany, cedar, cherry wood, and (obviously) oak. Mind you, this isn't the buttery or spicy oaky notes you'd find in wine - this is one of kind. Imagine walking into a carpentry factory or studio (much like the ones I'd frequent of my uncle during my childhood), or an old home built with various types of wood that have accumulated dust and must over time. This is EXACTLY what this tastes like to me - a blast to the past filled with complex woody flavors and fruitiness, toppled underneath well settled must, funk, and slight tartness. Extremely easy to drink. Dry, yes, but also very juicy and extremely refined with years of aging. The woodiness may seem a bit too one-dimensional at times, but it's so unique that I can't really dock it for anything. This really was an experience unlike any other.  As I found myself sipping on the dregs at the very end, I wondered if I'd ever taste something like this again. I probably won't, but it's wonderful to see what excellent wood and the ever fantastic recipe of 3F's oude gueuzes lead up to after years of aging. Unbelievably rich yet super easy to drink, and filled with aromas that take me across different palates overall, this is supremely fabulous stuff. I will hold this memory as closely to me as possible for the rest of my life.",0.7014635102863853,5.0,0.999

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Thanks to a few people we were able to put together the entire vertical and almost all the BA variants. Lots of fun gents!   From a 750 into a snifter 2012 vintage Bottle 197 of 685  APPEARANCE: Just like all the rest of them. Pours relatively clear for an imperial stout. Produces a small, one finger medium-looking head that quickly fades to a wisp and ring. Black body in the glass with some carbonation evident. Only a ring remains until the end and leaves no real lacing down the glass. A little too light a pour and an average head at best.   SMELL: Pretty bold nose of bourbon barrel, oak and caramel notes. Some sweet cream and light vanilla from the barrel as well. Hints of molasses and dark chocolate from the base Dark Lord as well, but this is more about the bourbon barrel, thankfully enough. Pretty nice actually. Impressed.   TASTE: A bit hot up front perhaps, but the bourbon barrel, oak, vanilla and sweet cream from the barrel is very enjoyable. A big and persistent finish of sweet molasses, caramel, a hint of dark chocolate and some bitter coffee from the 2011 base beer, as well as lots of bourbon and oak flavors from the barrel as well. Lots of barrel flavors, meshing well with the normally overly sweet Dark Lord base beer. These two players compliment each other surprisingly well.   PALATE: Slightly lighter than the base beer, but still big enough. Just like the other DL variants as well. Medium body with medium levels of carbonation. Creamy enough, goes down fine and finishes rather sticky on the palate. A bit of a burn and some heat lingers.   OVERALL: This was the first BA DL we drank, so it basically just went downhill from here. Surprsingly enjoyable and well balanced, this is more proof that Dark Lord is better in the right barrels. I'd go as far as suggesting FFF just bourbon barrel age the whole batch and charge $40 a bottle. Much better use of Dark Lord. This was the second place finisher for me, just behind the PvW version and ahead of the Cognac variant. Lots of good barrel flavors that mellow the overly sweet base beer, but also allow the enjoyable parts of Dark Lord to play a role. Good stuff. Cheers for the fun day gents!",0.6626042308622141,4.5,0.9988
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"I picked up a bottle of Bell's Barrel Aged Expedition Stout at The Lager Mill. I've been wanting to try this beer for a while now and I'm excited to see how it turns out, so lets see how it goes. 2017 Vintage. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a snifter.   A- The label looks nice, it's got a nice classy look to it and it's just a little eye catching. It poured a dark black color that didn't change when held to the light and it had a quarter fingers worth of darker tan head that was just a little bubbly and it died to a thin ring that eventually faded away to nothing and didn't really leave any lacing behind. This is a good looking beer, it's what I would expect from the style.   S- The aroma starts off with a higher amount of sweetness with the bourbon barrels being the first to show up and they impart some strong bourbon, boozy, lighter oak and lighter vanilla like aromas and it's the aroma that sticks out the most in this beer. Up next comes a slight bit of doughy yeast with some noticeable alcohol and that leads into the malts which impart some dark malt, roasted malt, light charred malt, dark chocolate, light smokey and sweet malt like aromas. Towards the end comes the dark fruits which impart a little bit of a dark cherry like aroma. This beer has a very nice aroma, but I wish it was a little more balanced.   T- The taste seems to be similar to the aroma, but more balanced and it starts off with a lower amount of high sweetness with the bourbon barrels still being the first to show up and thy impart all the same aspects that they did in the aroma, but they are lighter and they still lean towards the bourbon and boozy aromas and I wish that was a little more balanced. Up next comes a slight bit of doughy yeast with a noticeable amount of alcohol that's burns a little and it's warming. Up next comes the malts which impart al the same aspects that they did in the aroma and they show up just a little more this time with the dark chocolate sticking out the most. Towards the end comes the dark fruits which are just a little lighter then they were on the aroma and they still impart some dark cherry flavors. On the finish there's a little bit of bitterness with some more sweetness and some more alcohol and it has a bourbon, dark chocolate, roasted malt and slight dark fruit aftertaste. This is a very nice tasting beer, it's more balanced than the aroma and all the key aspects come through nicely.   M - A little smooth, motor oil like, very velvety, a little creamy, a little crisp, full bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. The mouthfeel is good and it works well with this beer, but I wish it was just a little smoother.   Overall I thought this was a very nice beer and it's a very nice example of the style, it had all the aspects that I was looking for and they all came together nicely to make a tasty and intense beer. This beer had ok drinkability, one would be my limit, anymore than that and it would become too much for me. What I like the most about this beer is the taste, it's more balanced than the aroma and all the key aspects show up. What I like the least about this beer is the drinkability, I wish it was just a little smoother. I would buy this beer again and I'm really interested to see how it ages, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a big and bold barrel aged imperial stout. All in all I was happy with this beer and I was a little impressed with how well the taste came together, but I think I still prefer Black Note. It's one of the better Bells beers I've had and it's a very nice example of the style. Great job guys, this is one tasty and intense beer, keep up the hard work.",0.6874074202982624,4.25,0.9987
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"poured into a duvil ""like"" tulip glass by Toppling Goliath staff.  reviewed from notes taken 6/1.  Appearance: black bodied beer with dark brown head. It looks exactly like Morning delight.  Smell: Smells exactly like morning delight, but has a splash sweet and mellow of bourbon. The coffee and maple syrup are more prominent in the nose and do infact overpower the bourbon.  Taste: Tastes just like it smells! Its morning delight with a mellow splash of bourbon! The mellow bourbon melds perfectly big maple syrup and bold roasty coffee. Clark just nailed this beer. Before I drank this beer I was concerned that the barrel notes would cover up all the things that make morning delight my favorite Toppling Goliath beer, but its honestly the Mornin' Delight is still the focus of this beer and the subtle barrel notes compliment it perfectly!   Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Creamy, silky, and very smooth. This beer just coats your mouth with rich flavor. Not even a hint of booze, just like Morning Delight. Carbonation is spot on perfect.   Overall: Its another Toppling Goliath masterpiece. I would say that its a tie, its really to close for me to call. I just cant decide which I like more... Morning Delight or Kentucky Brunch; honestly I feel they are equal! World class beer no question! This is a case where a non-barrel aged beer is just as good as the same beer with a barrel treatment. You dont see that happen to often in craft beer! Clark and company at Toppling Goliath are really making magic happen in Decorah, IA!",0.6370911949884885,5.0,0.9987
Black Tuesday,"One of my all-time wants, at last. I'm glad this year's batch wasn't difficult to get as I thought it would be. 2013 vintage. Poured into a snifter from a 750ml bottle on NYE, and for obvious f***ing reasons, split with as many people as possible. Then again, I might have had 6oz of this, when all was said and done.  Pours a viciously opaque beer, with no light going through this thing at all. No much carbonation or head retention, it seems - about a half film of a fizzy tanned head coated the top of the glass. I believe this is bottle conditioned, but it seems to have made little difference in the carbonation (although I have heard of these gushing before), and overall, well, it's extremely syrup like (think more fortified wines and low ABV chocolate liqueurs) and it's definitely quite intense overall. Not pretty, but not the point here.  Quite a monstrous aroma, too - once you get past the slightly stinging boozy sensation from the beer at hand, lots of flavors reveal themselves in a firm, stoic manner. Dark chocolate, roasted, charred wood and grains. Raisins, prunes, and dates. White pepper and lavender, alongside a cornucopia of barrel spices - vanilla, burnt toffee, caramel, cinnamon, cloves, tobacco, and leather. The bourbon these guys are using is of extremely good quality, and it softens up a lot of of what would make this too harsh to drink. At the same time, a lot of the notes from the bourbon - which would normally be overly sweet - add an elegant vibe to the madness by feeling rich and bright, and not over the top or unbalanced. Really good - could strive for more balance, but I suppose that's not the point here.  Holy hell! The flavor and finish kicks most barrel aged stouts out of the park, however. I was simply stunned on how flavorful and complex this is. At first, you are immediately battered with all kinds of sweet and rich notes from the base beer, consisting of roasted chocolate, fudge, and molasses, as well as some rich dried dark fruit notes, ranging from raisins to cherries. Then, when all is said and done, the bourbon starts to work its magic - tons of vanilla, burnt toffee, caramel, cinnamon, and maple syrup, as well as an aftertaste where all of these flavors are fully enhanced and continue to rise in part of the excellent, creamy oaky notes. More nuances make themselves noticeable as this warms - licorice, tobacco, leather, baking soda.   Unbelievably complex, and a scarily easy beer to drink. While the alcohol was present in the aroma, it's barely noticeable here. You barely feel it, to be honest, and I regretfully drank this much faster than I should have. A little too syrupy overall, and some extra carbonation would really help this thing. Regardless, this is certainly my favorite flavored bourbon stout to date!  Imagine crossing a highly quality RIS, Tawny port, and Kentucky bourbon, and you have Black Tuesday. So many flavors and profiles to pick from, and I'm happy I have two more bottles that I plan on cellaring for a good long while. I'd imagine this would soften up further, and cut the sweetness down in a more elegant manner. Definitely not one that I'd want to have too much at a time, unless it's all I'm drinking that night. While it's not perfect, it tastes pretty amazing. Cheers to the Bruery for this successful experiment!",0.6866501010090797,4.5,0.9986
Mastermind,"12oz can, didn't see a date, but was brought back just a few days prior from Vermont. Poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass. Thanks to Steve for his generosity. Enjoyed on 8.17.15, reviewed from tasting journal.   The beer pours a bright gold color, hazy and cloudy with straw hues and a finger of white head, little retention but great lace. The aroma is super tropical, loads of pineapple, citrus peel, mild resinous pine, floral, a bit of mango, super bright, clean and snappy with just a kiss of pale malt. The flavors are right in, mango, pineapple, crisp and fresh, tangy with some nice bright wildflower, a bit of citrus peel bitterness, mild pine but really tropical and juicy, a decent amount of counterbalancing malt is there as well, adds a bit of sweetness too. The mouthfeel is good, coating, moderate carbonation, lively with an easy but dry finish.  Verdict: A very nice double IPA from Fiddlehead. Delicate, juicy, bright, clean, fresh, tropical, super refreshing as well. These Vermont brewers keep putting out gem after gem, and this beer can hang with the best of them.",0.7037174347121424,4.0,0.9986

Nose smelled like a bag of sticky, resinous dank had been dumped into my glass by way of the bottle! I rarely indulge as I have gotten older, especially while job hunting, but I can easily recognize the smell. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste had a unique bitterness, ranging from tropical fruit to bitter citrus fruit to resinous pine with a bit of cattiness thrown in for good measure! Whoa. I wonder why my hophead self never bothered to review this before, Finish was dry, hoppy & a good way to kick off 4-20 Day.  Praise be to Greg Koch & the rest of the Stoners!

Actually, pineapple & ruby red grapefruit, which is just a little sweeter than standard grapefruit. Mmmph! I think that I just creamed my jeans. Mouthfeel was medium, light for the style.

Sip Of Sunshine,"Fresh batch arrived at work. I cannot read the canning date, but I know this can is pretty fresh.  Poured from a pint can to a long-stem tulip at cold cellar temp.  Hue is a crystal clear, dark gold/bronze color. I was not expecting the clarity of this. Streams of beautiful carbonation are feeding a finger and a half white head that's receding pretty quickly. We're now at a spotty film.  Nose is delightful juicy hops, with coconut sugar, slight hoppy pineapple, sweet pine sap, and even a touch of lactose. I can guarantee this has none in it, but it has that sweet, creamy aroma. It smells lovely. No booze on the nose. An exhale, then inhale into the glass leads to a good touch of bubblegum that you get from a lot of Belgian yeasts. All in all, it smells like delicious candied hops.  On the palate, I get tropical hoppiness, coconut sugar, slight pineapple, and the faintest bit of sweetness. There is no detectable alcohol, and nearly no bitterness in the finish. This is such a nice change from the bitter bombs you sometimes get with IPAs of this nature. I'm a bit surprised by the ABV (8%) as I can hardly detect it at all. The finish is not bitter at all.  Juicy tropical hops, coconut sugar, a subtle sweetness, and an ever-so-slightly creaminess.   Mouthfeel is almost perfect. Medium carbonation is enough to keep it crisp and drinkable, and not flat, thick, nor prickly and thin. I have no complaints. I like effervescent beer, and this is just enough to keep me happy. Again, there's a little something in here that lends a creamy, almost chalky finish and I would not be surprised if you told me there was a touch of lactose (although I'm sure there isn't).  The second pour is slightly cloudier, although it's still pretty damn clear. Remains unchanged.   Overall, this isn't anything crazy in terms of style. However, I went into this with zero expectations, and I have to say, this is one of the best IPAs I have ever had. Delicious, juicy, hoppy, with hardly any bitterness and no booziness, a subtle touch of sweetness, and delightfully crisp and drinkable. THIS is what an IPA should be. Top notch. Highly recommend. Delicious.  Re-Review: 4/01/19  Pint can - dated Feb-19-2019  Tulipped pint glass - 44F  Pours a mostly clear/chill haze deep brass hue, with 3 fingers of foamy ivory head. Head stays in place for quite a while, slowly deflating, leaving lacing behind. 4.25  Nose: Ripe pineapple, peach, navel orange peel, mild hint of passionfruit, very slight coconut. Really not a whole lot going on, but it's cold, too. This smells WAY more New England than West Coast. 4   Palate: Slight grainy malt upfront, with a hint of sweetness. No huge malt presence. Nothing like I remember in my last review. A slight malt sweetness, but nothing sticky or syrupy or cloying. Hints of citrus and some bitter pine. Typical Citra/Amarillo/(Mosaic?). Feels out of balance. Particularly bitter. Like a poorly executed NEIPA. I remember this being fantastic. Right now, it's sorely disappointing. 4  Mouthfeel/Body: Medium plus, to full-bodied, with a medium level, fine effervescence. Not soft. Not thin. Just a beery medium feel. A touch resinous. 4.25  Overall: Maybe my palate is just completely screwed right now, but I'm just not enjoying this. With revisits, I usually change my scores, but I'm not going to do that this time. I'll revisit this on a different day, and see if it's just me. Otherwise, my palate has drastically changed, or this is just a baf batch. Right now, to me, it tastes like a crappy, bitter, sloppy IPA. Hoping it's just me.",0.7020739179647222,4.25,0.9985
Sip Of Sunshine,"Canned 8 days ago.  L -- Slightly hazy pale orange with a three finger solid white head that dissipates fairly quickly, leaving minimal lacing. Looks less beautiful when held up to direct light, but such is the case with many cloudy brews.  S -- Incredibly complex hop character: aromas of pineapple, peach, mango, apricot, pine, honey, maple, lilac, orange, and grapefruit, to name a few. The only aspect that prevents a 5/5 rating is a very mild sulfuric smell that is almost masked by the pineapple.  T -- Largely follows the nose. Very well-honed focus on the fruitiness that hops can impart without *any* of the bitterness that often turns me off to particularly potent IPAs (i.e. Sculpin).  F -- Starts mild, building to an explosion of hop flavors, which then taper off to a nice faint sweetness.  O -- Wow, is all I can say  93/100  EDIT (4/30/17): I've recently had the newest iteration of SoS, which contains the 2016 crop of hops. They wrote a post about this on their website, and I agree with their feeling that the aroma is less tropical fruit filled and the flavor is a little less 'juicy' than before. I'm not going to change my scoring numbers since I still really like this brew. It's pretty clear that the current dip in quality is temporary and not due to factors in Lawson's control (i.e. overproduction)  EDIT (8/29/17): Yep, Lawson's has pulled SoS back on track. Just as fruit-forward as ever! A little more weedy-dank than before  EDIT (9/12/17): Tastes maltier than before. Sweetness is bordering on cloying. Might be because can is almost a month old? Seems weird that it would show age that fast, though...  EDIT (11/9/17): A lot less sweet than the last batch I tried. This one has a stronger rindy/herbaceous character to it. Fabulous aromatics  EDIT (12/27/17): Getting more apricot, floral, and peach this time around. The sweetness is again a little higher than in previous cans, and like the last time I found it fairly sweet, this can is also about a month old. It seems that SoS is best consumed within ~3 weeks of canning.  EDIT (4/22/18): 2-week-old can. Really nice sweet floral character this time around. Big, juicy aromatics with that same hint of sulfur I got in the first few cans I had. Definitely better than the last batch I tried  EDIT (7/27/18): Canned two weeks ago. Yep, still really good  EDIT(11/16/18): Trying alongside Double Sunshine, lowering rating slightly in regards to aroma and mouthfeel. Still one of the best (hoppy) shelfie beers you can get in MA.   91/100",0.6759192510032235,4.75,0.9984
Black Tuesday,"alright. this is it. everyone else out there might as well stop making massive barrel treated imperial stouts, because black Tuesday is the best one there is, and there isn't much room to improve this one of a kind offering from the bruery. major thanks to drlovemd87 for hooking this up! it pours a surprisingly thin looking dark chocolate brown with just a light fizzy tan head. not to say its thin, but I expected this to be syrup, like the older viscosity or the mikkeller brunch, but it isn't, it still looks like beer, which is good. the head isn't epic, but it looks damn good all up. the smell is intense, not nearly as alcoholic as it seems like it should be for nearly 20% abv. I get a ton of nice roasted chocolate malt, cocoa nibs, light vanilla and bourbon. some char and some sweeter milk chocolate too. its complex and huge, but it isn't overpowering or out of balance. now the taste? that is overpowering! wow! what an explosion of flavors here, everything I could smell just cascades over my whole palate. chocolate is large, vanilla is bigger too than it smells, its almost like the best ice cream ever, and its got me thinking about a float... is that sacrilege or is it encouraged? the weight of this beer and its alcoholic strength are not immediately apparent. im lost in a chocolate covered oak orgasm here, its maxed out. the feel again impresses me, that its still beer like at this size. decent carbonation and a full body, but again, it isn't syrupy or overly sticky thick as to be undrinkable. obviously a bottle to share, but wow, this is incredible. id say this is a special occasion beer, but its somehow even too good for Christmas, if that makes sense. its more like just pop it on a random Wednesday and see what happens. again, drlovemd87 is a legend for making this possible. I wont soon forget black Tuesday, and I am really curious for its other incarnations.  edit: drank a fresh one last night as a midnight toast for the new year. i have to say, i was surprised that this wasnt alcoholically hot. the year on the one reviewed here i thought had done much of the mellowing, but its mellow as its made. i have even more admiration for this beer now, really really special stuff.",0.629947131192434,4.75,0.9984
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2008 vintage purchased in Brussels from Bier Tempel.  Had to uncork with a bottle opener, but not due to a lack of pressure—the huge thunk as it opened almost perforated my eardrums.  Looks red, bright and very pleasant. Head foams up at the beginning, but then fizzed itself out so that only a thin ring of fine bubbling remains. Carbonation is gorgeously fine. Looks a great fruit lambic.  Nose is wonderfully and genuinely raspberry fresh. Plenty of tart fruit, a hint of sweetness and lots of genuine lambic acidity to give its basis. The fragrance of the fruit is very true and really lovely.  Taste has that classic Cantillon acidity: raw, cutting and tart, but the sweetness and fragrance of the raspberries gives a truly wonderful counterbalance. Still acidic and with a slightly strained bitterness on the finish, but everything else restrains and leavens it beautifully. Yes. This is a wonderful balance for a fruit lambic. Restrained, truly fragrantly fruity, balanced, but still raw and aggressive.  Yes, lovely. The fruit is just right in this one, and the Cantillon acidity is slightly more restrained. Gorgeous.",0.7268210165856349,4.5,0.9984
Green,"Okay so this can of Green was canned on 11/01/2016... no expectations but immense curiosity! Definitely plan on comparing to a fresh can.  So far so good.. the look is beautiful, hazy and golden orange. Not put off at all! ... Yet.  2 for 2... the aroma doesn't smell off in any way, exactly as I'd expect a juicy Tree House IPA to smell.   Okay now it's becoming a little more clear... definitely getting strong citrus notes, and surprisingly strong bitter hoppiness on the palate that kind of hangs around a bit too long. But I'm also getting a good amount of tinniness. It's lost that juiciness, and while the hops are pleasant, it's lost its balance, and the finish just has too much of a metallic presence. Don't get me wrong though, I am very pleasantly surprised at how this has held up.  The body is fine, nice leve of carbonation, slight stickiness. Creamy foam in the pour, heavy lace retention.  Overall this was more of an experiment... however turns out this beer is still very drinkable. Having not had Green before I have nothing to compare to directly, but based on past Treehouse stuff I've had, it really wasn't that bad. Obviously these ratings shouldn't be taken as gospel, and will be updated accordingly once I get my hands on a fresh can! Cheers!  UPDATE: Got a fresh can!! Canned 11/21/17. Very excited.  Pours an awesome hazy light orange. Quarter inch of white foam with frothy lace that quickly fizzles out.  Creamy pineapple and tropical aromas galore. Such an awesome nose.  Nice present hop bitterness, loads of pineapple and tropical fruit.. truly Galaxy at its best.  Smooth, creamy, juicy, slightly sticky. All around great.",0.6859164026122824,4.5,0.9984
Vicinity,"750ml bottle, 06.14.16, tagged on the back, poured into a Trillium snifter glass.   The beer pours a hazy and cloudy peach color, golden hues with some orange tones with a soapy white head, only about a finger tall with moderate retention but nice lace. The aroma is wonderful, peaches, nectarines, apricots, beautiful bright pitted fruit with some mango, tangerine and some soft sweet, doughy malt and a nice mineral water presence. The flavors echo the nose so well, huge amounts of light stone fruits, tons of peach flavor, lychee is as advertised, soft white grape acidity, tangerine with some mango as well before a bit of citrus rind bitterness appears, light pine and some hop spice linger well with doughy malt sweetness and a lingering mineral water flavor. The mouthfeel is great, full bodied, coating, soft and smooth yet lively carbonation dances on the tongue with a quenching finish that is moderately dry.  Verdict: A beautiful DIPA from Trillium and a truly world class offering. Often their IPAs become too focused on one flavor, or are too bitter, or just overhopped, ruling out any balance or complexity, however, this is truly great. Complex, excellent balanced with an assertive malt backbone that offers just enough sweetness to keep the bitterness in check, but I just love how bright and delicate the flavors are. This is a really special beer.",0.7266231600759505,4.75,0.9984
Chocolate Rain,"750mL bottle poured into a tulip. Huge thanks to Chris for sharing!  (A)- Pours pitch black with some surprising tan and brown bubbles/froth considering the massive ABV on this thing.  (S)- A very dense but rich burnt caramel and cocoa with vanilla oak. In the far background is a more pronounced rich dark chocolate component. Very nice.  (T)- Similar to the smell, only a far far greater rich and silky chocolate flavor amidst dense caramel and vanilla oakiness. Some heat as well at the end, but definitely not nearly as much as I was expecting on a near 20%ABV beer.  (M)- A mellow carbonation level, but it fits this well. Very strong and rich overall. I like the deep chocolate middle of this beer's flavor profile; that richness definitely helps mask the huge ABV.  (O)- Definitely a fun and successful spin on the regular Black Tuesday. To me it is a bit hotter, but still not as massively crazy going into it. Extremely rich though. I daresay I almost like the regular BT version over this actually.",0.6857343313105206,4.0,0.9983
Enjoy By IPA,"This actually isn't a single beer, but it would be quite the chore to put all the actual beers on here, and people have already been reviewing more than one on this page so why bother? I'm going to review multiple versions of this beer and just use the rating of the one I like best. So far, that is the first one.  From notes taken 04/19/17:  This is the Enjoy by 04.20.17 batch. Got to it in the nick of time!  Beautiful, clear bright orange, like a new penny. A steady stream of bubbles coming up from the bottom just add to the aesthetics. There’s a very fine and filmy off-white head, moderate retention, about what you’d expect for something this boozy and filtered and soft. Tangerine, mango, pineapple, cantaloupe, alcohol to smell. Yum, yum! Palate is very tropical as well but does a better job of blending all these distinct but similar elements together, and bringing the alcohol, some caramel, and more perfumy and rindy (grapefruit) hop qualities to the front. Excellent balance, far better than your average Imperial IPA, which I enjoy up to a point but always eventually have to start wincing at. Taste and feel both remind me somewhat of an American Wild Ale, there’s a rubbery quality to it right by the grapefruit rind, but this is nowhere near as sour. Extremely peppery retro-olfaction. Thanks for that, ethanol and hops, both! Deceptively light-bodied, and masking the heat further with abundant, tight, softer, but active carbonation. You eventually feel it all throughout your mouth and throat, though, it’s only a matter of time. 4, 4.75, 4.5, 4.25, 4.5.  From notes taken 06/11/17:  This is the Enjoy by 05.29.17  In fairness I have been too busy to review, or do much drinking at all. Hiking and camping trip, new job without quitting old job, spring cleaning. But I must apologize still for the lateness of this review, given the Enjoy by Date that is this beer’s name! Still, I am not too worried that will have deteriorated greatly if other beers in this series are any indication. I review 02.14.17 a month and a half late and it was still one of the best Imperial IPA’s I had ever had.  First pour is a crystal clear golden amber, looks like a pale lager apart form the head which is a fine and fluffy foam of the palest yellow with great retention. Grass, citrus rind or oil, faint apricot, alcoholic burn on nose. Palate is caramel, biscuit, and a little grain, more robust than nose, with a harsh soapy bitterness and an extreme peppercorn finish and retro-olfaction, but is otherwise the same flavors as aromas. Medium-bodied, very effervescent for the style and ABV, starting with abundant, fine, sharp prickles and finishing softer than velvet. Some heat from the ethanol if you pay close attention. Not as good as the other two I have had in this series yet (02.14 and 04.20), but that makes sense as this is more of a basic IPA than they were. I just picked up Enjoy by 07.04.17 an hour or so ago, I’ll try to review it in a more timely manner. 3.75, 4.25, 4, 4.25, 4.",0.6830962707418081,4.5,0.9983
Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"good heavens this is good. thanks to drlovemd87. he purged his cellar this week and i was the fortunate dumping ground. he may have mixed up, because this is insanely special beer, and i am very lucky to have tried it. cracked the bottle knowing nothing about it, but was quickly impressed with its every detail. neat frosted yellow color to it, good white head, creamy and rich, but soft and delicate too, dreamy and sexy, cool. smells awesome, slight tartness to it, but some of that is the hop tropicality going on, funky brett, very mature and dry, with a bit of pucker to it, maybe a hint of some souring cultures, but a lot more brett than bacteria from what i can gather. lots of hops too, juicy and tropical, southern hemisphere and heavy handed. i get some wheat in the malt base, belgian pils, maybe some oats too, it has that fluffy texture to it. the oak is impressive here, maybe a slight suggestion of white wine, but here i get vanilla and sweetness from wet fresh oak, not a barrel of any kind. tons of must and musk and funk from the brett, an old school belgian type i would guess, reminds me of some cool old world saisons in that way. lemony as can be, but also pineapple, lime, and passion fruit come into the fold with the hops. what i want to savor and remember about this thing though is the yeast, i want it forever on my palate, i want to copy it in my homebrew, and i want every brewery who attempts to make beer in this style to try it, because this is what its supposed to taste like. unsure ive had one ive liked this much. great carbonation, crackling dry, and with a very special mystique about it in general. i want to bathe in this stuff. my goodness.",0.6443732152460961,4.5,0.9982
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"12oz bottle poured into HF stemmed glass, split three ways. Huge, huge thanks to Josh (thebigredone) for sending this to me!  A- Pours a decently viscous dark slightly brown black, fairly opaque jet black in the glass with some light purplish brown along the edges, very thin mocha brown head forms that has decent retention and fades at a moderate pace to a flat top, leaves thin lacing that fades back into the glass.  S- Aromas of rich maple syrup, integrated bourbon, dark creamy chocolate, a bit of oak on the backend. Very sweet smelling, but very pleasant and retaining a nice balance. Definitely above average aroma strength.  T- Dark creamy chocolate, sweet/sugary maple syrup, balanced and integrated bourbon, faint hints of oak. Finishes with a strong, rich maple syrup presence with balanced bourbon, oak, coffee, and creamy chocolate. Easily one of the best finishes I've experienced from a beer.  M- Thick, viscous, creamy, very drinkable, incredibly smooth especially at a surprising 13%, only a faint presence of alcohol, fairly low carbonation but appropriate for style.  O- This beer definitely blew me away and is 100% worth the hype, possibly one of my favorite beers to date. There were a ton of strong, rich tastes coming out but it still retained a very nice balance and drinkability. I wish this was made on a regular basis and wasn't so rare so I could drink it all the time. I definitely recommend seeking this out especially if you like big, rich, balanced stouts.",0.7171149094284185,4.75,0.9981
Darkstar November,"Black wax capped 500mL bottle from j47paco (many thanks!). Late 2014 release. Served in a Cigar City teku.   Pours pitch black with a two finger cap of pale khaki head. A faint collar remains but leaves almost no lace.   Great balance in the nose. Sweet, inviting aromas of bourbon, vanilla, chocolate and molasses. I keep coming back to it because this is what a barrel aged stout should smell like.   The taste is full, rich and delicious. Bourbon, molasses, dark chocolate, flame kissed oak, vanilla, brown sugar, mild coffee and a good bit of alcohol warmth. There is some heat for sure but it feels appropriate. The sweet, roasty, boozey flavors play off each other beautifully.   Creamy, borderline chewy feel with soft but present carbonation. Bourbon, vanilla, chocolate and brown sugar coat the tongue for a lingering, delicious finish.   Darkstar November delivers on all levels. An outstanding barrel aged imperial stout that has everything I look for in the style. Glad to have a friend in California that sends me such pleasant surprises like this one!",0.6528727806296429,4.5,0.9981

Peche 'n Brett,"Appearance- A tiny bit gushed out of the bottle before I poured, so be careful. Pours up a good bunch of head which has excellent retention. The head is a pure cotton-white while the body is a hazy and dull pale amber which appears brighter when held up to the light. A good amount of lacing with slight patches of sheeting.   Nose- There are definitely peaches used in the making of this beer. Very well rounded and very smooth with light notes of other stone fruits like apricots. Some apple and banana and a slight note of pears. Redolent without being overbearing. Swirling doesn't add anything to the picture.   Taste- Starts off with a front of peach that promises to be quite powerful but fades rather quickly. Slight woodiness from the hop bitterness. Slight funk and straw on the finish. Very tasty but not exactly the peach bomb I was expecting. Slight tartness and faint hints of acetic acid. Some cherry and other stone fruits plus a mild note of pears. This is very smooth and very well rounded to the point that this beer has incredible balance integration. No hint at all of the 10%. Very easygoing and delicate. Light barnyard, mushrooms, stinky cheese, straw, and armpit around the edges. I wish these aspects had more presence because that would definitely give this beer more character. Slight oak but this beer is mostly about the peach. Never cloying but always present, its presence makes it a must for peach lovers. Really good beer that shows inclinations of being great. No flaws at all and extremely drinkable. Such sublimity that I think it can be considered a great beer. This is a beer that really grows on you. Some hints of orange and lemon make this somewhat mimosa like or what I imagine a mimosa made with peach juice would be light. Nice dry finish really cleans up the flavor profile well. The pear juice works perfectly in concert with the peach notes.   Mouthfeel- So light bodied that this tends toward airy. Light carbonation works really well for this beer. It doesn't make your tongue tingle but there is a mild and smooth effervescence that works well for this beer.   Drinkability- Extremely drinkable to the point of being dangerous. It's so good that it's easy to ignore how good it is. Fortunately, it's pretty hard to get or I might being spending 20 bucks a pop on these frequently.   Overall- Great beer that is definitely worth the 20 bucks. I would definitely take one of these over any Cascade beer (not that they're necessarily comparable but in regard to the price point). Reminds me a lot of La Fin du Monde which also doesn't have great complexity but is exceptional at the few things it does do. A must try if you can get your hands on it. While I'm scoring this lower than what I scored Seizoen Bretta, I'm under the impression that this is a better beer. I will have to sample the regular Bretta again to compare.",0.6920342819447224,4.5,0.998
Peche 'n Brett,"Review #500. Served at the January tasting at the Taproom. Thanks to Darren for bringing this! One of my top wants, which for some reason has been impossible to find every time it's released. Poured out of a 750ml bottle into a tulip glass. I believe this is last year's release.  Logsdon is known in my mind for making nothing but gorgeous looking farmhouse ales, and this is no exception, in my mind. Looks a lot like fresh squeezed peach juice (or a combination of stone fruit, in general). Orange amber, with a thickness and cloudiness from the sediment and yeast, as well as a fluffy bone white head that covers the top of the glass in a graceful, imposing manner. Loses a bit of head retention over time, but leaves some sticky foam at the sides of the glass, thankfully enough. Really appetizing looking overall.  Not what I expected at all at the nose - while the stone fruit is displayed predominantly but the addition of peaches, as well as the malt profile at hand, the Brett has definitely made its mark on the beer in a funky yet strange appealing manner. At first, there's a blast of peaches, nectarines, and apricots (oh God, my mouth is actually watering as I write this), and then barnyard funkiness from the Brett, displaying notes of wet hay, some leather, and cheese. Lots and lots of cheese, particularly the goat cheese that stone fruit is often stuffed in. By a mere chance, apricot goat cheese happens to be one of my favorite things, so this isn't too off putting for me. Finishes tart on the nose, with an astringency from the yeast. Very wild, and very rustic, but I would have never guessed the alcohol was so high here.  The flavor is even funkier and intense, but it's really one of the most memorable American wild ales I've had in quite a while. Strong notes of peach concentrate, apricots, orange, and light pine meld with the funky qualities from the Brett, showing big cheese rind notes, leather, and wet hay. The oak qualities work their magic at the end and hold up the fort rather well, displaying lactic sweet flavors, as well as light tobacco and vanilla. This, in turn, accentuates a sweeter creamier factor that rounds out the Brett and gives the impression of eating actual goat cheese with stuffed dried peaches and apricots. The finishing touch of baking soda (a classic from Logsdon, as seen in their Saison Brett) cleanses the palate and gets you ready for each sip. Sweet, tart, funky, slightly saline, and creamy all at the same time. The carbonation is phenomenal here, done in the same vein as a sparkling wine. Gentle and enticing - very complex, and very refreshing.  This is a 20 proof beer?? No way - I could easily down an entire bottle of this without complaint. I would love to have a fresher bottle and open it right away, but the Brett here seems to build on some wonderful, creative aspects towards the beer's development. This could easily be the best beer Logsdon has made so far, and it's impressive that they've made a beer of this caliber so drinkable, and readily available for any occasion, as well. Excellent stuff!",0.6713372999197438,4.5,0.998
Beatification,"A pretty near perfect score here as I can confidently say that I've never had a better sour - wild ale. That being said, I've never had a Cantillon anything or Cable Car so when that happens, I'll come back and revise my statement if necessary.  Batch 5 - Bottled 1/10/12  A - The most sunshine vibrant yellowish orange I may have ever seen, minimally somewhat cloudy in the 10oz wine glass I poured it in. Sunshine in a glass. Similar color to the bottle's label but much more BEAutifil. Active, begging for a whiff. Would get a perfect 5 with good head & retention...  S - Complexities really begin to come through as it warms - especially that barnyard funk. Citrus included oranges and lemons, some pineapple and this beer smells nice and tart. Very welcoming. I'm on the fence with a lot of sours but I knew I was going to really enjoy this one at first smell.  T&M - Follows nose. I am amazed at how freaking refreshing and crisp this beer is. At only 6% it's still a nice sipper on a warm sunny day. Clean crisp bone dry finish, I mean...even if your not a fan of the style, you usually can still tell when you're drinking a high quality specimen which Beatification most definately is. Pretty blown away I must say.  O - Usually, I don't find myself wanting much more than 10-12oz of most sours but I could have sapped back on 3 of these easily. SO refreshing, SO crisp, SO clean, and such a nice bone drying finish that kept me wanting more. I'm told and assuming age will make this beer better as it usually does this style, but I really couldn't imagine where it could have improved or how it could have been better. Admittedly, I'm not new to the style but new to appreciating it and finally feeling confident in my ability to critique or review sours properly. Great freaking stuff!",0.6691117019619544,5.0,0.998
Chocolate Rain,"Managed to try this the other night thanks to a surprise bottle opening at a bar I go to. Thanks to everyone who was generous enough to share! One of my top wants for a while. 2013 vintage. Poured into a wine taster glass from a 750ml bottle. Keep in mind that I *haven't* had Black Tuesday yet as of this review, so I have nothing to compare it to.  This actually was a gusher. Are you joking?! Nevertheless, pours pitch black (as expected), with some brownish, tanned streaks, which mostly manifests itself in the head. The alcohol legs are monstrous, but lacing is actually far better than I thought it would be, leaving behind granite looking droplets against the wall of the glass after every swirl and sip. Looks like a chocolate liqueur melded with port wine, plain and simple.  An immediate blast of malty, chocolate and oak laden sweetness reaches the nose, but it's a little more complex than other imperial stouts within the category. The first flavors that hit the nostrils (albeit a brief sting from the alcohol) consist of fudge, caramel, and vanilla, and soon meld into a far more unique profile at the finish - with roasted cashews (seriously, not joking, this is very nutty), tobacco, prunes, dark cherries, and molasses. Quite a complex offering, and while it fails to hide the alcohol as well as I'd want, it's still extremely diverse for a mere chocolate-forward bourbon barrel aged offering.  The flavor is exactly what you'd expect it to be based off of the aroma - an enormous cascade of chocolate and fudge, combined with a brief sweetness of burnt toffee, vanilla, and caramel. Very, very sweet, but luckily other flavors make themselves noticeable at the finish, ranging from dark fruit (blackcurrant, prunes), spices (cinnamon, tobacco), and a brief tannic consistency from the oak barrels. While there's some carbonation, this is extremely syrupy, but luckily it's not overbearingly sweet so it doesn't bother me as much in the long run. As a port wine lover, it's pretty impressive how this tastes very similar to drinking a high quality Tawny with some dark chocolate alongside. Very enjoyable, but 4oz was more than enough.  Very good, but most certainly not worth the $40 price tag they're asking for on this. TCHO is one of my favorites and their chocolate really accentuates the base beer overall. Perhaps improves it, but I will only find that out as soon as I get to crack open my first BT. I'll be honest, though - it's going to be hard to find a beer of this type again that is as decadent and as complex as this one is!",0.6812866776615993,4.0,0.9979
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Was very happy to see the three bottle stout set arrive at my door, courtesy of cparles. Cheers! We drank Morning Delight, Assassin and KBBS, in that order.   From a bottle into a snifter Vintage: 2013 Silver wax Bottle X of 300 Whisky barrel aged with coffee  APPEARANCE: Same as Morning Delight. Pours out black and thick, yielding a smell, medium looking, creamy, dark mocha colored head with great retention. Jet black body with no carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a swirly wisp and bubbly ring. A faint wisp and ring remain leaving some falling dots of lacing down the glass. Thick black body and a great head, and just a touch more lacing would give it a perfect score.   SMELL: Basically like Morning Delight with some whisky barrel aging. Maple, caramel, butterscotch, coffee, milk chocolate and vanilla cream, with some whisky and oak pulling it all together. Really decadent. Bold and infinitely complex, with lots of aromas all over the place. Morning Delight was already a perfect score, so too bad this one doesn't go to 11.   TASTE: Outstanding. Lots of maple syrup, caramel, whisky and oak up front, with more sweet butterscotch, maple and barrel flavors at the swallow. Definitely maple and coffee with a big, lingering finish of bitter coffee and dark chocolate, coconut, sweet vanilla, whisky and oak coating the palate. Very flavorful, complex and absolutely delicious. Wonderful sweet flavors with just enough bitterness and whisky barrel to provide the perfect balancing touch. Just great.   PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. A touch lighter than Morning Delight, but still full enough for the style. Very creamy smooth on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes slightly sticky. A bit of heat lingers as well. Good feel.   OVERALL: Though it doesn't claim to be, this could very well be barrel aged Morning Delight. Absolutely fantastic. This has everything I loved about MD and added a touch of whisky barrel aging on top of it. One of the rare, rare occasions when a beer of this magnitude surpasses its billing. This is the best barrel aged imperial stout out there at this point, and I can't imagine being able to surpass this either. Would love to drink some of the second batch that is apparently waiting patiently at the brewery. Thanks again cparles. World class.",0.6646273997003599,4.5,0.9979
Society & Solitude #4,"Served from a 750ml growler into a Founders tulip. Thanks to Cam (UrbanCaver) for hooking me up!  APPEARANCE  Let's face it, IPAs almost always look sexy. This beer is no exception. It's a hazy orange juice color and sits under a rather large slightly off-white head. It had beautiful lacing throughout the (too short) drinking session. This is the kind of beer that would make even the most prude chap get all hot and bothered.  SMELL  This beer filled the room with hoppy goodness when I opened the flip top. Tons of Citra yumminess, which brings tropical fruits like pineapple, grapefruit, and mango. The Galaxy brings passion fruit and more citrus. There is a bit of a grape-like aroma as well. For being 8%, there's no alcohol to be found on the nose. This. Beer. Smells. Great.   TASTE  This is bonkers. It seriously tastes like a blend of freshly squeezed grapefruit and orange juice. I almost expect a little pulp while drinking this. There is a very good amount of tropical fruit character, like mango, a lot of pineapple, blood orange, etc. It's not as bitter as other IPAs I've had. Usually, when an IPA isn't bitter I get disappointed, but in this beer I don't miss it at all. It actually tastes less bitter than grapefruit juice while leaving all of the wonderful sweet fruit flavor. No alcohol to be found in this fella. The only negative thing I have to say about this beer is that there is the absolute SLIGHTEST dank/grassy flavor, but that's only because I drank my Haterade earlier. Overall, the Citra and Galazy are playing together so wonderfully in this beer you'd think they were soul mates.   MOUTHFEEL  Slightly under carbonated, which I can probably attribute to the 830+ mile trip that this beer had to undergo in the growler. That being said, this beer still has a wonderful mouthfeel. There's just enough residual sugar to keep this beer from going down exactly like water but is by NO means a struggle to drink. The body is medium-light, which is just about perfect for an IPA. There is a tiny bit of hop resin that lingers after the swallow, and it feels more like a grapefruit pith. Yum!  OVERALL  Hill Farmstead has been gaining a ton of respect lately, and beers like this are the reason for it. This is stupidly delicious and a triumph of brewing. I don't want to sit here and fan the flames of all the Hill Farmstead hype, but in my experience they totally deserve it. For me, the amazing thing about this beer is that it has the one thing that I don't like about Imperial IPAs - it's sweet, not bitter. I generally don't like IPAs unless they are tongue-splitting bitter. But this beer makes a fool out of me, and proves that you don't need an IPA that destroys your taste buds to be amazing. Whatever they are doing at Hill Farmstead they're doing right.   Cheers.",0.6337974574680091,4.5,0.9979
Madagascar,"Drank from a 1 pint, 6 fl oz bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA 2018  Review #1525  Dark brown/black appearance. The inky looking liquid was topped by a two-finger tall, super tight and frothy, tan colored crown that fell to a small collar. A few thin streaks of lacing stuck along the glass.  The aroma contained notes of vanilla but came across as a bit strange and artificial initially. There was a dry, powdery, almost plastic-y quality. As the head dropped, the vanilla really came forth, but it seemed more akin to artificial vanilla extract than high quality vanilla beans. Some brown sugar sweetness was also apparent. Subtle roasted malt notes. Touch of boozy, bourbon vanilla as well. As the beer warmed, the vanilla really intensified and seemed to transform into something reminiscent of high quality vanilla extract. More brown sugar. Bit of semisweet chocolate too. Amazing.  The flavor profile mimicked the nose pretty closely. The beer tasted a bit artificial and plastic-y initially but improved notably as it opened up. Strong roasted malt notes on the front end. Somewhat milky. Loads of punchy vanilla extract. A nice brown sugar-like sweetness was also apparent. Bourbon vanilla notes appeared mid-palate. Strong semisweet chocolate presence as well. The booziness increased slightly as the liquid moved along the palate. More vanilla, brown sugar and bourbon on the finish.  Outstanding mouthfeel. Super fluffy and smooth. Medium bodied for the style. The liquid contained a fine, zippy effervescence that frothed up really nicely on the palate. By the beer’s end, the liquid left a slightly sticky film on my lips.  Madagascar is one of the most vanilla-forward beers I have ever tried, and one of the most impressive of this style. Unlike most vanilla-infused stouts, which are often sweet and boozy, this was surprising balanced. If you own a bottle, be patient with this beer and give it some time to warm because it gets remarkably better as it opens up.",0.7002147756856452,4.5,0.9979
Mastermind,"Happened upon a four-pack of this brew at Craft Beer Cellar in Westford earlier today after work and just couldn't wait to crack one open to see how it stacks up to one of my absolute favorite NE IPAs, Second Fiddle! Fiddlehead is one of the best breweries I've visited in my 6 years of drinking beer; insanely fresh samples (once got a taste of Second Fiddle that was kegged that day and had just been put on before I came in!), a good gift shop and very friendly staff. A great thing about this beer in particular, though, before I get into the review proper, is that 25% of the sales go to a charity supporting the University of Vermont Children’s Hospital. Can't beat that.  Pours a gorgeous, clear-leaning bright yellow color with a generous dollop of creamy white head that laces spectacularly as it settles out. Lace is even better as the beer drinks, coming down in consistent, thick sheets. Very nice looking brew here, and quite a bit lighter than I expected for some reason. With the fairly-high clarity, I can honestly say I was pretty surprised by how this one looked.  Nose is punchy, lively tropical fruit (guava, pineapple and mango come to mind) with some grassy/dank aromas and a bit of West Coast citrus/pine. Pretty orange/lemon-forward. Ethanol is a bit apparent, but I also get just enough doughy and biscuity malt/yeast to almost quash it. This seems very laid-back, actually. The hops are pretty bright and apparent but seem well-balanced. Doesn't seem as aggressive or as traditional as Second Fiddle to me.  Flavor is bright tropical fruit, some catty notes, grapefruit pith and lemon, all layered atop a biscuit-forward malt body. Ethanol is even less apparent here than in the nose, which is interesting. This definitely doesn't drink like a bigger beer. Pretty juicy and bitter, with a lot of complimentary flavors of guava, pineapple and candied orange/orange peel.  My major sticking point of this beer is the rather stylistically-weak body, which kind of makes it less impactful than it seems like it should be to me. Still, the carbonation is decent and the combination of flavors makes it pretty damn good overall. I kind of randomly stumbled upon this one, and I'm definitely happy to have it, but it does feel a little less-amazing than Second Fiddle to me. I will, however, certainly drink the other three with aplomb, likely sharing the experience with great company.",0.6831693532085333,4.25,0.9978
Swish,"I feel like I've given too many fives, so I've been trying to find some fault with beers, but there's honestly nothing I could think of that would improve this beer from where it already is.   A: A beautiful cloudy golden orange colored IPA that has become one of my favorite things about the northeastern beers. I love the juice like appearance this has. Capped by a nice white foamy head.  S: Huge aroma that hits you as soon as you crack the can open. The aroma has ripe fruit like orange, pineapple, mango, but also plenty of pine like resin and earthy dankness.  T: Reminded me of Heady, though its been a bit since I've had one. There's a nice clean bitterness upfront, and that quickly gives way to a ton of hop flavor. Citra, Mosaic, and Simcoe hops are just such an awesome combo. There's tons of fruit flavor in this beer, and it mostly follows the nose. Behind all that hop resin is a nice bready malt base.  M: Similar to other IPAs from this region, the beer finishes dry as an IPA should, but there's a very nice medium bodied mouthfeel to it. Left nice sticky lacing on the glass.  O: Like I said, really nothing about this beer to improve on in my opinion, it has everything I love in a Double IPA, and I feel it stands with the best of the style. Thanks for this, psweendogg!",0.6543189537638342,5.0,0.9978
Green,"Officially one of the top beers I’ve had. Pours a turbid light straw yellow with a tight white head. Nose is a light pleasant pine, grass scent. Almost like a pleasant air freshener or piney candle scent. Obviously to some that might be unpleasant but it really is welcoming and pleasant to smell. So on to taste! Perfect 5! And I struggle to give any aspect a Perfect 5 but really this was the ultimate tasting experience. Can fated 7-26, 3 weeks old. Such a pleasant beer, nice grassy hay like sweetness with the perfect dose of pine. Now when you usually speak of pine notes you think of those huge piney west coast IPAs, in your face stuff. Well that’s not this. I get a lot of pine but it’s subtle on the palette and it lingers pleasantly after every sip. Notes of melon and light pineapple. Seriously, Green is so pillowy soft on the tongue but I digress. Back to tasting notes nice sweet dough malt base and the ever so slight hints of citrus peel but it’s only a footnote in this beer. Greens smell and taste sort of remind me of that first day we put up the fresh cut Christmas tree as a kid. If you get that then you get Green. Super smooth mouthfeel with a pleasant piney kick. Almost perfect beer in my book. Wayyyyy better than Julius, sorry TreeHouse Advocate ;)",0.672465341847292,4.75,0.9978
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"On tap @ DLD!  After searching high and low for a way to get this on the outside of the pub and giving up, someone with a red jacket handed me a cup and said ""enjoy"". Very gracious, thanks! Poured into my snifter - about 6oz but certainly enough for a rating!  The beer looks great in terms of color but is lacking in terms of head. Pretty dead looking, a voracious swirl reawakens a touch of lace but perhaps the most interesting aspect is the way this coats the sides of the glass. Not exceptional looking, but, for a 13% BA Beer, we'll still say the color is fantastic!  The smell is the best part of this beer. The layers of intricate depth of the base beer are still kicking. I get tons of dark fruit, chocolate, and burned malt. But an additional layer of bourbon and oak adds complexity where the base beer has smoothed out. Not a booze bomb at all, this has improved the base beer tremendously in the nose.  The taste is a slightly different story. Maybe I see BA huge stouts in a different light than others. To me, a beer like Dark Lord already has so many layers of flavor that I'm really just looking for the booze to mellow and the flavors to gel. To me, this BA version is quite good but I almost like the base beer more by itself. The barrel tastes and bourbon seem to stand on the side of the base instead of integrating. Don't ge me wrong, there are great flavors of dark fruit, chocolate, molasses and licorice. The barrel treatment was well executed, lending some wood, vanilla and bourbon, but I'm not convinced it was necessary or an improvement that warrented the investment.  The mouthfeel also takes just a small step back from the original beer. There's just a bit of a duality here, where it seems the base sludge and the bourbon are dancing but at different speeds. Still a great beer overall, and one I will happily revisit every year at DLD.",0.6691320405883239,4.5,0.9977
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Shared at DLD15. Silver wax. Served in a snifter.  Appears dark brown bodied, one finger bold brown head, good retention, no lacing. It looks just like Mornin' Delight does. Smells of sticky maple syrup, a fair bit of coffee, with a bit of oxidation, milk chocolate, a bit of bourbon. It doesn't smell a whole lot different than Mornin' Delight, but that's not a bad thing. However, on the palate, the bourbon comes through a bit more; casting an oaky presence in the background, very mild bourbon flavour/heat. The maple syrup still dominates as does the coffee, which I'll never complain about. Some milk chocolate and roasted malt backs it up. As with the base beer, it's a very two-note beer that the bourbon doesn't necessarily add much to. Mouthfeel is excellent, full bodied, sticky yet smooth, easy to drink. Overall this is a very good beer; it's not necessarily worth what it takes to get; economics aside it is an excellent stout that nicely balances two extreme flavours even if it's not particularly complex. No other brewer has been able to make a beer like this, with the exception of Tree House, so there has to be some points awarded for that.  Re-review: 2017 release, silver wax, bottle 849. Served in a KBBS glass, #properglassware. Thanks Dan. Pours a dark black body, one finger mocha head, good retention, not much lacing. Smell is whiskey, maple syrup and espresso, milk chocolate, oak, roast. The whiskey is pretty nice in this beer, actually, with a rich oak and vanillin contribution. Slight heat, which is also noticeable on the palate; which also introduces plenty of maple, coffee and chocolate in the mouth. A touch of vanillin, oak, and smoke. Mouthfeel is full bodied, slightly syrupy and sticky, good carbonation, nice finish. I still propose that Morning Wood from Funky Buddha is almost just as good for 5% of the asking price it takes to get a bottle of this, but hey, you do what you gotta do.",0.6619042836869214,4.75,0.9977
Double Orange Starfish,"Notes  The beer has a very nice look to it. It’s a bit brighter and more yellow than Aslin’s other IPAs but still has that delicious orange juice look to it. It definitely has that nice appearance of an orange juice. While it still has that nice orange look, the beer is mostly a juicy yellow.  The aroma is fairly simple but still pretty good. The smell mainly consists of a nice, strong orange note dominating the other more subtle notes. The other notes consist of a light mango and barely detectable pine that starts but gets overwhelmed by the orange notes. The thing to mention is how potent and strong it is. Here you have a beer whose smell is as strong as regular juice that others lack.  The taste is fantastic. It’s essentially a nice orange juice bomb with a bit of sweet mango to liven things up. There’s a slight pine presence in the aftertaste but it’s quickly hidden by everything else. Interestingly, the intensity is the same as the smell.  The feel is smooth and creamy with a heavy body. The beer has a slightly dry finish but for the most part it’s pretty refreshing.  Overall, another great beer crafted by Aslin. Even though the style is a bit hyped right now, this beer is still pretty good and worthwhile. Go for it.",0.6954881591312111,4.75,0.9977
Sip Of Sunshine,"Canned 4/9/18. Thanks to a convergence of out-of-state breweries and distributors to Nashville for the Craft Brewers Conference -- and them nicely bringing all kind of goodies with them for a multitude of around-town events and even some bottleshop hookups -- I was able to pickup at 4-pack and try this beauty for the first time. (Thanks Maryland Farms Wine & Liquors.)  Poured into a Teku. Attractive orange-copper body with just the slightest chill haze and one finger of soft off-white foam that fell quickly but then hung around as a nice soapy film that provided a little sticky lacing down the glass. A little swirling creates a fluffy, refreshed head with similar retention. Not the most noteworthy appearance, but a good looking beer nonetheless.  Aromas of dank tropical fruit, resin, citrus peel, wet grass, granola, wheat biscuit, and a little berry. Definitely an appealing mix of fruits and greens, plenty of dankness, and some malty balance. But much more subdued than I was expecting for a sought after IIPA.  Taste is a big step up, playing off the same notes on the nose but bigger and very well balanced. Good amount of fruity sweetness on the front, lots of sugared grapefruit and berry salad, with tropical notes of mango and guava plus some plum and green grape. Probably my favorite component of the beer. That's complimented with a healthy dose of sharp pine resin and an earthy, bready malt. Very pithy and citrusy on the back end with a lasting bitterness that breaks out from the long-lasting sweet notes. I love hoppy beers that go big on both sweetness and bitterness but find a harmony between the two, and SoS has that in spades. Very well done.  Feel is velvety, soft, and smooth and more substantial than the near-clear look would suggest. Not sticky but very coating, adding to the lasting bitterness and pithiness. I wouldn't call the beer boozy, but there are vapors and essences there that remind you that this is an 8% ABV brew.  Always hard for these ""dream beers"" that you've longed for for years to meet expectations. The flavors are truly outstanding for the beer type, though not in a class of their own. And the other elements are all solid to excellent, though not spectacular. But the overall drinking experience was extremely enjoyable and I would have this beer anytime the opportunity presents itself in the future, even if it's not the best IIPA I've ever had.",0.7060448252005981,4.25,0.9977
Nelson,"Straight pour from a pry-off 12oz bottle to a flared pilsner glass—AZ Wilderness’ Wilderpils glass. This has a bottling date of … who knows. “8254 1 0812,” whatever that means. All I know is that I bought the first sixer I saw in a store, and it’s a very recent release—past couple of weeks.   Appearance (4.0): Two fingers of bone white, fluffy foam rise off of the pour, capping a modestly hazy, glowing yellow-golden body. The head dies down slowly, leaving a pock-marked cap and concentric collars of delicate lacing linked to the beer with light, tight, lacy webs. The lacing doesn’t stick around forever, but the overall impression is quite pretty while it’s there.   Smell (4.5): Navel orange zest and alphonso mango flesh mix with lightly peppery, spicy rye that shakes off a bit of dusty straw as it wafts into your nostrils. Bright, grassy notes, underripe pineapple, and passionfruit rind mix together to make a slightly bracing, refreshing tropical mélange that’s never sweet and cloying (as much as I love those sweet, juicy aromas of some contemporary (D)IPAs). As it opens up, oodles of passionfruit and gooseberry come out. Classic Nelson Sauvin, boosted by the spicy earth of rye, which adds a nice depth off of which the hops can play out in their full expression.   Taste (4.5): In spite of the haze, this beer is all West Coast (which should be obvious, given this beer long predates the haze craze). The hops roll in clean and bitter, offering a nice grapefruit zest bite, quickly punctuated by earthy, peppery rye and a bit of that dusty straw character noted in the nose. In turn, that straw note rolls into wads of grass and a weedy, dank feel that underlies the bitter, lingering finish that weirdly turns into a nice, subtly sweet citrus note. Going back to the midpalate, passionfruit stays on the downlow, staying subtle and adding depth and color to everything else going on, but leaving a nice, funky tropical character that echoes across everything else. Meanwhile, gooseberry comes out in full tartness. It’s beautiful. No sign of booze.   Mouthfeel (4.0): Dry, medium weight but far from full-feeling, the body comes in atop a layer of medium-grain, somewhat prickly carbonation that foams up in a classically effervescent kind of way, not soft and velvety but not aggressive and champagne-like, either. It maintains a steady dryness throughout, before fizzling away with a not-quite-starchy, even dryer finish. This drinks like a West Coast IPA.   Overall (4.25): I like this beer. I like it a lot. It’s a West Coast IPA through and through, in spite of the rye and the haze. It’s actually a nice little case study in substyles, for that reason, and the end result is delightful. I’ve been wanting to try fresh Nelson for years, and I finally got to. This, to me, is a must-try. It’s maybe not the absolute best or most memorable West Coast (D)IPA I’ve ever had, but it’s also so well executed that its merits are unimpeachable. Like, it’s as solid as this substyle gets, and its individual components are outstanding: a nice showcase for Nelson with excellent brewing execution and a perfect use of rye. Very highly recommended. I’m going to enjoy the shit out of the rest of this sixer.",0.6844831050342993,4.25,0.9977
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"On tap at Toppling Goliath on release day. Served in a Duvel style tulip.  Pour: pitch black with two fingers of deep brown head. Leaves light lacing, and the head dissipates rather quickly.  Smell: woah. Lots of sticky maple, coffee, and a light bourbon. Some toffee and vanilla. A really nice roasty char, but no smokiness. Decadent and inviting. As it warms, it smells identical to Mornin Delight.  Taste: lots of butterscotch, coffee, and smooth roast. Some vanilla bourbon, and a touch of maple. The barrel definitely took the distinct maple syrup quality of Mornin Delight and gave it a toffee like quality. Finishes creamy with bourbon, coffee, and toffee.  Mouthfeel: really very drinkable. Lighter carb than Mornin Delight, but just the right amount. Very creamy, especially as it warms. Very little bourbon heat. Finishes creamy, lightly sweet, and lingers for a long time.  Overall: amazing. I enjoyed this better than Mornin Delight because of its superb balance of flavors. Easily the best barrel aged stout I've had yet. Awesome.",0.6666743209341421,4.75,0.9977
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Mine was the 2007 vintage.  Pours a brilliant deep red, with a thin head. The beer is actually surprisingly clear for a lambic, but otherwise, it looks like I would expect it to. The smell is all fruit. Sweet fruit, candy like, maybe a bit of tartness, but almost reminds me of a fruit soda. Very nice - though sometimes you don't mind the smell of garbage in a wild ale. The flavor comes across first as tart and acidic, but it has a nice sweetness to balance. The flavor in some ways reminds me of raspberry-lime juice, if there were such a thing, also a slight sourness that is really nice, like sour candy. The taste is just surprisingly clean for a wild ale, just a nice blend of sweet and tart, with the flavor of fruit, just amazingly balanced. The bo dy is a little fuller than I expected, probably from the sweet fruit juice, and the carbonation is low, but you can tell that it's there. Fairly nice. This is really a nice beer, the sourness is there in it's fullness, but it is just held in balance with the beautiful blending and the addition of fruit. It's not too acidic, and doesn't remind you of garbage, it's just a great lambic. Really a joy to drink.",0.6875415190087153,4.0,0.9977
Chocolate Rain,"Boom - Chocolate Rain. Huge shoutout to whomever decided to bring this to our tasting. I keep forgetting who brought what, dammit. Anyway, this was a big want of mine, and I'm grateful for not having to search the country for it. Pours a very deep brown color, not quite deep enough to be called black. Even an aggressive, straight down pour produced almost no head - a slight ring that fades to naught rather quickly. Possibly an effect of such a high alcohol content?  The aroma is one of the strongest and most poignant I've ever come across. It fills your nasal cavities long before you finish bringing the beer to your nose. Deep, deep vanilla aromas; dense and syrupy. A bourbon-like alcohol character is strong and robust up front, almost burning the insides of my nose. The bourbon is settled down a bit and held in check by a delicate chocolate that emerges; sweet, milky, and creamy through and through. All of these aromas only intensify as the beer warms up. The bourbon burns more, the malts get sweeter, the vanilla gets more dense. The harshness, the sweetness, the sheer dominance of the nose is quite intimidating - but hey, I would expect nothing less from a 19.5% ABV stout that was this highly acclaimed, right?  The first thing that my taste receptors send to my brain from the moment this beer touches my tongue is, ""holy fucking sweet!"" The sweetness is very high on this one, right out of the gate - honestly, just a tad overboard. The flavors, however, are very, very nice; baked brown sugar, bourbon soaked licorice and mild dark fruit, heavy vanilla beans, and lots of light, cocoa undertones. There is a solid oak and wood characteristic, front to back as well. As anyone would expect, this one gets much boozier as it warms up - starting off as a bourbon heat, it turns into a hotter bourbon heat accompanied by a slightly phenol or rubbing alcohol kind of heat.   The more and more I drink this, the more and more the vanilla-bourbon flavors stand out to me as the most dominant. The aftertaste is controlled by some light cocoa flavors that are sadly overshadowed by heavy booze. The sweetness also lasts long into the aftertaste, like a boulder rolling down a hill that is very hard to stop. Near the tail end of this beer, the alcohol is much more dominant and it actually helps keep the sweetness more in check. Slick, sticky, slightly thick mouth feel with super low carbonation.  Super glad I got to try this one - my 6 oz. pour was perfect - I would imagine that any more than this would be too much. The flavors were awesome, but there were two main things holding this one back from being a top 10 beer for me: it was a bit too sweet, and it was a touch too boozy and hot, especially as the beer warmed up. I guess that's to be expected from a 19.5% ABV beer, right? So maybe I'm being too harsh. But the beer was still damn good and the flavors were on point. Overall, if this were taken down on the ABV level and the sweetness was controlled a little better, it would easily be a top 10 contender.",0.6665900421369323,4.0,0.9977
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"its always an occasion to drink what is deemed on this website to be the best beer in the world. regardless of what one may think about how such rankings are figured, it is a treat to say the least. i remember when i was heady and westy 12 before that, times have changed! after a couple of narrowly missed opportunities to drink this one over the years, my man drlovemd87 came through in the clutch with this rarest of the rare bottle. my pour is as thick as paste, slick and black like crude oil, and without hardly any head to it, near still in appearance, shiny, almost gelatinous looking. the aroma and flavor are intense but unfortunately (to me) familiar, i wanted this to be strikingly different, at least from a quality standpoint, and as good as it all is, its not head and shoulders above all else, it might not even be my favorite barrel aged coffee stout i have had this year (shhh). a few things are immediately obvious to me. the first is that whatever barrels these were, they seem to have housed some excellent whiskey. its not more or less of it, nothing about the oak profile specifically, but the bourbon character itself seems obviously better than most of what else is out there, this i will grant. the second thing, is that saying something like this is objectively better than something else in its category that is notable and near perfect and all of that, is highly problematic, approximations and cloudy memories and nothing more than opinion. factually, this isnt that much better than any number of great beers in its field, and i will stand by that. i cant spend the whole time drinking this thinking about the merits of a ratings system i dont control or other beers i like better though, that would be a foolishly wasted opportunity to enjoy quite literally the best. its full of rich bourbon, heavy vanilla and maple syrup qualities, even the texture of maple syrup, tons of barrel char and earthy burnt dark grain and chocolate, and a well integrated high end coffee profile as well, in some ways quite simple, but impossibly mature and nuanced, enhanced magically by the whiskey, and with lingering sweet, bitter, raisin, cocoa, and bourbon character. its as good as they say it is, that is not my comment. my comment is that others are at this level too. i am enormously thankful to have been able to drink this one, especially without having to pay the absurd secondary market prices this is fetching. if you are considering dropping some coin for this on a forum or whatever, i would reconsider, not that this isnt awesome, but its likely that your local bottle shop or brewery has something comparable...",0.6378896474467667,4.75,0.9977
Sang Noir,"Enjoyed out of a 750 mL brown bottle with a cork & cage top. The label is clearly marked as being from the 2012 vintage. Enjoyed out of a small Belgian tulip glass.  Appearance - Pours a deep, dark garnet red with black cherry highlights and an overall hue that reminds me of the burgundy label as I get near the bottom and can't avoid turning the otherwise mostly clear liquid into murky mess from the sediment in the bottle. With the right angle, the light reflects off the glass and makes it look almost black. Atop the body sits a one finger head of effervescent looking foam that is a pinkish khaki tint to it.   Smell - A wonderful mix of aromas here--I get distinct tartness and a twinge of sour to come from the cherries, but also plenty of vinous notes of wine must as well as a nice tannic vanilla that I can only assume comes from the bourbon barrels. There is a pretty good showing from the wood itself, making for a super funky, musty aroma that is again held in check by the sweetness that is just enough to provide a balance.  Taste - Picking up right where the excellent aroma left off, there are obvious elements of acidity with the cherries and wild bacteria, but those are balanced quite well with sweeter vanilla and barrel flavors. Here, the characteristic of the wine barrels is much more at play than in the aroma, with those pinot notes evoking impressions of light cinnamon. There are also notes of persimmon and red plum adding to the depth of the taste. The bourbon is slightly lost in all this, but you can tell that it's presence is definitely enhancing the rest of the the same way a properly-salted meal will invoke all sorts of flavors without actually tasting directly like salt.  Mouthfeel - Light-bodied with moderate to high carbonation and a gentle pucker on the tastebuds that finishes with a semi-dry feeling on the tongue.  Overall, just an awesome beer. It's hard not to say that it's my favorite from Cascade, but it's been awhile since I had the Apricot. Regardless, this is a fantastic beer that manages to be aggressively sour without being a tooth enamel-peeling chore to get through. An excellent balance of the acidity and sweetness.",0.7034289963204826,4.75,0.9976
Haze,"Look:  Hazy orange. Looks almost like a mimosa but obviously with a much bigger head. Off white 1.5 finger head. Retention looks good. Moderate to high carbonation from looking at the bubbles. Heavy lacing on the glass.  Smell:  Jumps out of the glass when I was pouring it. The can description is on the nose. Orange juice and peach are easily identifiable. Tropical fruit is also there. They say papaya but I get more guava. Some grapefruit rind in the back there too. Plus a little wheat grain, too. Quite a pleasant, layered nose, especially for the style. Some leafy hops poke their way through as the beer warms. Pine needles too.  Taste:  Actually quite gentle for a double ipa. Fresh orange juice is definitely there. Light white peaches. Finishes with a light bitterness and some wheat crispness.   Feel:  Medium body. Carbonation is spot on. Nice and lively. Many double ipas are more syrupy than this, so I’m glad to see this working for the beer. Makes it quite drinkable. As I’m writing, I find myself agreeing with the tasting notes from the brewer almost exactly.  Overall:  Not what I’ve come to expect from a double ipa. My favorite double iPas are definitely more bitter and thicker in mouthfeel so this almost feels like a completely different style of beer and not very much like everybody else’s IPA. It’s damn drinkable though. The nose is great, mouthfeel is wonderful, and it’s probably the best brunch beer I could think of. The only thing holding it back for me is that the taste could be punchier. It is delicious and so easily drinkable, but for a double ipa I think I want just a bit more heft. This feels like a regular ipa. That being said, this is my favorite IPA of the four I’ve tried at tree house.",0.6865548873664056,4.5,0.9976
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Reviewing the 2012 Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout from Three Floyds Brewing Company out of Munster, Indiana. This is bottle number 4 out of 420. We consumed this bottle as part of a Dark Lord (and Behemoth) vertical to celebrate the then-impending, now-official marriage of my friend Scott Nicholas. Thanks again for bringing the bottle Scott, and congratulations!  Score: 99  2012 vintage bottle served in a stemmed wine-style glass and enjoyed on 09/19/12.  Appearance: Pours an ink black color with a thin layer of beige head that settles to a ring around the glass. Poor lacing, but excellent cling and retention with what little lacing there is. 4/5  Smell: Smooth bourbon, milk chocolate, oak, dark chocolate and a surprising amount vanilla (though there is less vanilla than the Bourbon Barrel Aged Vanilla Bean Dark Lord). Brown sugar and dark fruit too. There is the faintest hint of coffee in the nose. Huge doses of chocolate and smooth bourbon are present in the aroma. A slight roastiness and more oak comes out as the beer warms up. The aroma is bold and perfectly balanced. 5/5  Taste: Brown sugar, sweet bourbon and light vanilla. The sweetness is nowhere near the level of the base beer, which greatly lends to its drinkability. This tastes a lot like the Bourbon Barrel Aged Vanilla Bean Dark Lord, but with less vanilla character -- shocking, right? The Bourbon Barrel Aged Vanilla Bean Dark Lord seemed sweeter than this variant as well, though I would not characterize either variant as remotely being ""too sweet."" Molasses and raisin flavor too. No coffee. Like the nose, the flavor is bold and balanced. There is a light alcohol warming effect on the palate in the finish, as might be expected from a 15% ABV beer, but this beer is far from boozy. To the contrary, it is smooth and easy to drink. 5/5  Mouthfeel: Viscous and full-bodied with minimal carbonation. The beer is sweet, slightly sticky and creamy on the palate. 5/5  Overall: This beer's only real flaw is it's cost. As with all barrel aged Dark Lord variants, this beer cost $50 retail and was only obtainable at retail pricing by having a winning scratch off lotto ticket that each person got after buying a ticket to Dark Lord Day (and even then, you had to claim one of the four variants before they ran out). Those who struck out on the Dark Lord Day lotto would have to pay an even higher premium via trade or otherwise, as this beer sold for $300+ on eBay before eBay halted alcohol sales earlier this year. This beer is substantially less sweet than the base beer, but it's still a sweet (just not ""overly sweet"") brew.  Recommendation: This is one of those few highly hyped, hard-to-get, extra-premium priced beers that absolutely delivers, but there are plenty of comparable beers out there that cost half as much (or less). This is one to seek out and try for the purpose of ticking, but I recommend trying to acquire one with a group of friends to share to ease the cost.  Pairings: Drink this decadent beer as it's own digestif. It's heavy enough to suffice.  Cost: $50 for a 750 ml bottle.",0.6465985081655896,5.0,0.9976
Oude Geuze Vintage,"750mL 2002 Yellow Label thanks to OldStyleCubFan and later from EricE. Tasted both alongside the 3F ""vintage special edition"" with the red artwork bottled on the exact same day in 2002! Had three blind samples. One was doubled up. I was able to pair the two that were from the same bottle together. These were more watery and slightly less sour and complex (ended up being the gold foil, yellow label, normal ""vintage"" label shown here). The yellow label has more carbonation, white pepper, citrus fruits. The nose has amazing moldy white grapefruit and citrus rind. Mouthwatering palate.  750mL 2002 Red Label thanks to OldStyleCubFan and later from MrChopin. The red label alongside the yellow label is slightly better albeit very subtly since they are the same batch but the red label stayed in Armand’s storage for two years or something longer. Proper storage has lent the red label a brighter, fuller nose even with softer carbonation. More cedar, spice, pepper, barn. The taste is still white pepper, grapefruit, mouth watering sour with bright citrus and fruity tangerine. Still excellent and slightly better than the Yellow Label. 1/11/2011 8/4/8/5/16=4.1  750mL 2002 Yellow Label thanks to BrainLayer at Sour Epic Part 2. We had this next to some of the best sours in the world and this one I enjoyed more than J&J Rose and J&J Blauw back to back. This bottle was just on the ball. Juicy nectarine nose, big Brett C tropical notes. Taste is sharp, juicy, dry and dusty with loads of moldy grapefruit and huge citrus zest. Incredible white pepper, orange peel, grapefruit onslaught. Awesome stuff. Probably the best 3F beer I’ve had besides past tastings of J&J Rose. Hot damn. 12/11/2011 9/4/9/5/18=4.5  750mL 2002 yellow label thanks to BrainLayer. Okay. Let’s crack this bad boy once again. Is it really the best beer of all time? Cork pops off with aggression. Pours is hazy, deep orange with beige mousse. Thicker. Quickly settling. Nose is perfect. Mild celery seed gets demolished by overripe peach and red grapfruit which yield to overwhelming fresh birch and cedar with hay and horsey dry funk. Cobwebby old character is juxtaposed with fresh and fleshy overripe peach. An insane experience. Taste is ultra quenching white grapefruit peel with sharper wood shavings. So much old dried citrus peel plays with wood and hay. Palate is perfection. Effervescent and juicy with briny saltwater demanding this be drunk in large, quenching gulps. It’s disappears so quickly from the glass. What can you say? Is the best beer that which demands a slow savor, or that which demands its consumption with boundless temptation and seduction? This is probably the best beer ever made. Like the big brother to Beatification which passed on its power but will never yield the throne. 1/22/2012 10/4/9/5/19=4.7",0.6629096022071073,4.5,0.9976
Beer:Barrel:Time,"drank on 12/27/2017  L-very little, tiny, light tan head on top of a big thick black base...nice lacing but not at the elite level  S/T-following each other, this has it all in the nose and palate...the oak comes through like a fine bourbon....really strong in the best of ways followed up with a strong boozy bourbon right up there with the greats. A baker's chocolate phenomenon following in line with all these great flavors in a complex combination. There's possibly a hint of smoke and maybe some dark fruit or caramel as well. That's getting really deep into this. AMAZING  F-elite. The booze on the nose and taste does not come through in any kind of heat or boozy fashion, just incredible flavors. This is insanely smooth and drinkable for this level of ABV. Thickness is monstrous and so enjoyable, definitely a nice surprise as it comes through thicker than the nitpicking slight on the lacing.  O-not much negative to say on this at all. Truly an elite beer and hopefully I can get a few more down the road. All 4.75/5 ratings for sure and the 4.75s are just because it's becoming harder and harder to give anything a perfect score. SO GREAT",0.6695008578615764,4.75,0.9975
Juicy,"an extremely impressive little bottle of saison here, wonderfully hoppy and wild, and quite literally juicy in its overall complexion. pale and bright on the pour, fizzy at first but settling back quickly, less hazy than anticipated, but not all the way clear, lots of little bubbles rising up. the aroma forces an almost smelling salts sort of response from me, with an involuntary jerk back of the head, whew this is pungent. right away i get strong wine tannins, a mature bretty funk the gives to a lambic sort of oaky sourness, and of course the unmistakable new zealand hops, which seem dry hoppy right away. my mouth waters like i cant remember, so i set right in on the first swig. a big whoosh of carbonation takes the beer right to the roof of the mouth and back of the tongue, the whole palate is getting in on this right from the get go. amazing wild yeast complexion, thats what i love most about this one, super funky farmy brett with soft green apple, meyer lemon, and even white grape notes, dry but sort of richer or more complete of a brett spectrum than most, but this sort of moves into a more bacterial citric pucker, also mature and fully wild, like real lambic, it certainly has that almost medicinal start and the inoculated woody later bit, its certainly at least that complex. the hops are fruity too, pineapple comes to mind, more white wine. the wood is soft, the mouthfeel is aided by that, and its flavor is as woody as it is winey, with a nice herbal botanical input from the hops at its peak. tangy and sour, but not so much so that we didnt wish this came in a three liter bottle, my whole palate wanted the whole bottle, but i felt compelled to share it. highly carbonated and fuller bodied, but delicate in its overall presentation. dry but not all the way. one of the better and more nuanced but also aggressively flavored hill farmstead beers i have had, truly distinct and memorable, i can still taste it even. this is about as much as you can do with brett saison, especially for not having fruit in it, an enormously delicious beer. huge thanks to my trading buddy back east!",0.7016363555367282,4.75,0.9975
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Thanks to Brad for sharing this at his tasting on Saturday!  2010 vintage, served side by side with Dark Lord and Vanilla Bean Dark Lord.   Oak Aged Dark Lord pours a near jet black, with hints of brown visible at the upper edges of the glass when held to the light. Head and lacing are somewhat subdued, but given the serving medium, I couldn't ask for more. A great big aroma of rich roasted malt and oak barrels. Wow. Dark Lord is one of my favorite beers, and I find the addition of oak barrels to be quite wonderful. There is a prominent licorice note in the taste. Someone described the feel as ""oil slick in the gulf"" and I have to agree. Thick and chewy, this beer leaves a coating of stout residue in your mouth that utterly blankets the palate. This is remarkably smooth, given the high alcohol (it is higher this year than previous vintages), and gives a nice, warm burn as it slides down. I really hope I can go to DLD next year and get some of this fresh from the tap.  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  On tap at DLD 2011.

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Three Floyds Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord 2012  Poured into a tulip glass from a 750ml bottle. 2012 Vintage (Red Wax, Red Skull) Bottle: 355/688  Pours as thick as mud. With some dark dark abyss like hues. There is a nice 1 inch tan colored head that neatly forms with some great dense bubbles; nice and creamy looking. The head recedes very slowly. (5.0)  Aroma starts off with intense sweetness. Wow. Molasses and toffee. Dark fruit notes of prunes and some raisins as well. Very sweet nose. Bourbon and boozy heat are noticed in the nose as well as some nice slight honey and vanilla sweetness notes. I can’t state it enough. Very sweet. (4.5)  Taste follows the nose. Starts off with some intense sugary, caramel and molasses notes. Very sweet yet delicious. There is some slight chocolate sweetness as well but then is overtaken buy the caramel and molasses again. Wow. There is some woody notes in there with hints of vanilla and some honey. The Bourbon barrel shines adding some intense booze notes as well as some woody notes. However, these notes are not harsh. Dangerously smooth with the 15% not very noticeable. Mouthfeel is nice and thick and silky at the same time. As the beer warm some of the boozy heat is perceived a bit more. Great brew. (4.5)(5.0)  Overall this is a gem. I know a lot of people find it overrated but this version of Dark Lord is pretty good.

Madagascar,"yeah, this is about as good as anyone has done one of these vanilla bourbon huge stouts. its so much more vibrant on the vanilla, less boozy on the whiskey, and not anywhere near as sweet as a lot of them, despite intentionally being a sweeter stout, it has balance and resolve, and i loved every drop of it. not quite black on the pour, but a very dark almost inky looking brown, shiny and viscous, with red wine legs on the edges of the glass and a short mocha colored head. it has an intense vanilla aroma, fresh beans, like sliced and scraped pods, almost like it was added to an already finished beer, its first for sure. the oak and bourbon come next, really complimenting that vanilla aspect, but adding a little corny sweetness, toasted wood, caramel, and nutty properties to this. the roast of the malt brings coffee elements, bakers chocolate with bitterness, and finally back to the fresh vanilla, its pungent and intense and amazing. the even cooler thing as that this evolution of flavors is exactly the same in the flavor as it is in the nose, driven mostly by vanilla, intense, but oddly balanced. the wood is strong, the whiskey is flavorful without being hot, and there is a great low end here with coffee notes and balancing bitter roast and char. its also not too strong, sometimes these work their way up into the 12% abv and above range, and in my opinion thats just too much most of the time. smooth in feel, very little carbonation but none is needed. its nice to slow this down not speed it up. let in linger. an amazing complexion of flavors, huge vanilla, absolutely incredible beer. when do the bottles come out??? id love to acquire one for the cellar and share this with my friends here. tip top!",0.6884550483716964,4.75,0.9974
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Was definitely looking forward to having a few glasses of the oak-aged Dark Lord again this year. This was my favorite the last few years and being that one can only have it once per year, I was getting anxious! Judging by the number of people at the event several hours before the gates even opened, we figured it would behoove us to get in there quickly!  Poured into the cheap plastic cup, it really just doesn't do this beer any justice. It is still a nice looking pour - thick, oily, black, and messy. Just enough juice on the pour to create a slight frothy head. I have a feeling this would be quite nice in a snifter, but I digress.  Ah yes - wood and bourbon. Really doesn't smell that much like standard Dark Lord, but damn impressive. Sweet smelling, with some syrup or maple and some chocolate. I really like what the barrel has done to this beer.  And every bit as impressive on the palate as I remember. As expected from the smell, there is quite a bit of bourbon presence that is not around in the standard version of Dark Lord. I'm not as good at detecting the woodiness in the taste, but the smoothness given by the barrel-aging process is amazing. This is by far my favorite of the three Dark Lords - if not for being served in a plastic cup, it would certainly receive a perfect score. Very thick, chewy, and oily - I love the way it coats the mouth and hangs around long after the beer is gone. One of the detractors of Dark Lord over the past couple of years has been the sweetness. The oak-aging replaces that sweetness with a more mellow smooth taste - this is why it is so amazing.  Tough to rank the drinkability on a three ounce pour - which is why it is imperative that one gets several glasses! And even after several glasses, I'm lining up for more. I still contend that Three Floyd's should bottle about 50 bottles of this per year, and then produce 50 ""golden tickets"" that are different than the normal ones. A true Willy Wonka experience. If you get one of the special golden tickets in the mail, you can redeem it for a bottle of the oak-aged. Something to think about Nick.  Regardless of the chaos of Dark Lord Day (which I truly enjoy), the oak-aged Dark Lord alone is enough to bring me back every year. A masterpiece.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"12oz bottle, 2014 date with gold wax, poured into a Toppling Goliath teku. Enjoyed on 12.13.14, shared with my dad, review is from Tasting Journal.  The beer pours a jet black color, motor oil consistency, very thick and viscous out of the bottle with a lovely finger or so of mocha colored head, thick, taut and firm that has superb retention yielding a few spots of lace but with great dark staining legs. The aroma is fantastic, loads of smooth chocolate, coffee is assertive, but at the same time mild, lightly roasted with a nice fruit character that helps accentuate the stone fruits that come out in the nose, charred oak and whiskey with a bit of toffee sweetness linger well and just a splat of maple that helps curb any heat from the barrel and the bitterness from the coffee. The barrel character is what leaps out to me on the tongue, very smooth, nice mix of charred oak, lightly chewy and soft bourbon, a bit of toffee, a bit of molasses, even a touch of spice while smooth and decadent chocolate, lightly bittersweet, rolls over and brings forward stone fruits with lightly roasted and fruity coffee. The balance is supreme and the finish has just a breath of warmth to it from the barrel. The mouthfeel is perfection, thick, rich, creamy, viscous, silky, smooth, coating, any adjective you like for a stout, this has it, carbonation is perfect, enough life while being totally forgotten yet it also doesn't feel too sticky or clumpy, and the finish is incredibly fluid.   Verdict: A lot of hubbub and noise about this beer and it's all deserved. The balance and complexity is tremendous, everything in true harmony, no one characteristic is truly defining and each aspect of the beer is artfully mastered.",0.7092360595188156,4.75,0.9973
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Updated Review:  From 5 May 2012 Served in a 3F Geuze glass (as it should be) Bottled: 15/4/2003 Best before: 15/4/2020  I don't usually re-review beers, but the 2003 vintage is absolutely amazing. Give this beer some age and you will not be disappointed.  A: Cork burst forth with happiness. Murky straw. 1+ (frothy white) fingernail head on gentle pour.  S: Barnyard funk, lemon rind, hay, cheese. So inviting and tasting. Nice!  T: Pronounced sour, funk, and earthiness. Loads of grapefruit and lemon zest with green apple.  M: Light bodied with soft carbonation.   O: Absolutely fantastic! Hands down, one of the best gueuzes I have enjoyed to-date (Blauw is slightly above). So balanced, smooth, and refreshing. If you have multiple bottles; forget about a few and drink them with 8-10 years age.  4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5  From 19 December 2011 67th Review Bottle to tulip Vintage 2007  Shared with farundrpar during a beautiful prepared dinner by our wives on a recent visit to Amsterdam.  A: Golden hay. 2+ (pure white) fingernail head on medium pour.  S: Lemon zest, hay, must, white pepper. Not as much “funk” as I was expecting or had hoped for, but it still smells quite good!  T: Grapefruit/zesty citrus fruit with green apple. Hint of funk/sour, but not terribly pronounced. Quite nice, but I think it will grow and develop with age.  M: Medium bodied with high carbonation.   O: Better than good, but not great YET! A very crisp and refreshing beer (especially when paired with a wonderful salmon dinner), but I think this vintage can stand to age for quite some time. I’m thinking the 2007 vintage should be enjoyed no earlier than 2014, but that’s my €0.02.  4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5",0.6446797467070893,4.5,0.9972
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"22oz bottle into a snifter Vintage 2012 #68/688  650th BA rating, 630th BA review, and #96 out of the top 100 that I began ticking away at a few years ago. Only 4 more to go!  A big thanks to rjjhoffman for sending this long time want over in a trade.  A: Opaque black with some browning on the edges and 1 fingers width of mocha colored head. Head dissipates down quickly and leaves essentially no lacing, but some alcohol legs. 4.25  S: Lots of sweetness, lots of booze, and big barrel notes. Chocolate fudge, fusel ethanol, subtle dark fruits. Barrel notes include a fairly big bourbon charred oak, and a peat like character. Lots going on, and very nice. A bit too boozy perhaps. 4.5  T: Huge sweetness, particularly upfront. Its a sugary, syrup sweetness, which would be a bit much, but it fades quickly and nicely into some absolutely wonderful flavors or charred oak, roasted malt and chocolate. Tons of bourbon barrel notes, which complement the otherwise cloying sweetness of regular Dark Lord. Some boozy ethanol to round out for palate profile. Its simply fantastic. 4.75  M/D: Full bodied, carbonation very low which is appropriate, its smooth but is a bit syrupy, ABV is noticeable but its not hot. Drinkability is good, all things considered. 4.5  O: Overall, this is a great beer. I can confidently say that I’ve never had a beer which was so significantly improved by barrel aging. I am not a big fan of regular Dark Lord, but the Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord is wonderful. Definitely worth seeking out. Looking forward to someday landing a BVDL for comparison. Merry Christmas! 4.75",0.6510066322158571,4.75,0.9972
Chocolate Rain,"750mL bottle poured into a snifter 020912 Lot 30  Another huge thanks to Redbeeron for sending over this big time want in a trade!   A: Pours a quite thin appearing dark brown with lightening on the edges. An aggressive pour yields approximately 1/2 fingers width of light tan head which dissipates down almost immediately to a think outer ring. Leaves no appreciable lacing. Actually appears very similar to a cola.   S: Tons of bourbon and dark fruits. Cinnamon, caramel, vanilla bean ice cream, rich dark and milk chocolate, balancing booze, maybe even a hint of coconut. Jesus. Its so sweet and delicious smelling. Intoxicating. Incredible.   T: Huge sweetness up front, with a big caramel/toffee presence. Dark fruits, fig and cherry. Pretty boozy from the get go, but it has to be to balance out the huge sweetness. Cocoa is significant and hangs around for ages in the aftertaste. Taste is similar to dark chocolate covered cherries, soaked in booze. I also get burnt sugar, bourbon, raw oak, some roasted malt flavors and vanilla which makes itself known but is mild. Awesome palate profile here.   M/D: Smooth, slightly syrupy with an appropriately low carbonation. By no means thin, but could be thicker and chewier. Drinkability is actually very good, but this one is a slow sipper, thats for sure. And although this has a boozy component throughout, it does an incredible job of keeping the 19.5% ABV in check. Its the highest ABV beer I have had to date, and even with that ABV it is not necessarily even hot going down.   O: Overall, another big hit from the Bruery in my book. Its literally one of the best smelling beers I have ever had, and the taste is excellent (but not quite to the degree of the nose). Im very glad I was able to try this one, and will definitely seek it out again. As far as in comparison to Black Tuesday, I like CR more. Better aroma and greater balance in the flavor profile (less of the straight up diabetes-inducing sweetness bomb that BT is). I'd drink both any chance I got, but BT is great, and CR is excellent.",0.6654653686711608,4.5,0.9972

Mastermind,"nt over to get this for the release, and by 1030 or so in the morning, there was a line that wrapped like a snake around the building. there was no way we were waiting in that, i thought for sure all the beer would be gone, so we gave up on it and went elsewhere. to my amazement, when i got home, a friend of mine offered me up a can, since he had scored that day and was feeling generous. lucky me, we shared this a few ways, and all in our party were very impressed. the freshness for one, consuming hoppy beer on the day it comes out is always a treat, but this one is a real unique brew too. it has a super pale color to it, looks like a hazy pils in the glass, with an airy white head over an inch tall and fading only slowly. it smells like amarillo and citra, maybe mosaic, its hard to say for sure if there is more than a few varietals in it, but the nose is amazing. ive been getting pineapple juice from these hops lately, and i got it pretty strongly here too, but there is also notes of mango, aloe, lime zest, and cheerios. pretty basic stay out of the way type malt base, very light body for a stronger ipa, and quite clean in the finish. bitterness is moderate, or rather aggressive but just balanced expertly by the sweeter oily elements of the hops. somehow lighter and more drinkable than others, and with no appreciable yeast flavor going on, unlike many of its vermont counterparts. a beautifully done brew, perfect twist on the style for hot weather, and a beer i was real thankful to get my hands on. these guys are really putting out some delicious stuff lately, wow!",0.6635629045361421,4.5,0.9972
Swish,"Canned ten days ago, and I'm excited as hell to review Swish. I've had several cans before, but I've never reviewed it, and never this fresh. I'm letting it warm just slightly after taking out from the fridge, as I do with all quality IPAs.   Appearance-wise, this may be the best looking of the many dozens of ""hazy"" IPAs I've tried. You can't really see the particles, like you can with too many other turbid beers (Tired Hands, ahem), but the aggregate effect is one of soft luminescence. I swear, in the right light, it almost glows, like Marsellus Wallace's suitcase. The head is perfectly proportioned and leaves a gorgeous lacing as it dissipates; I get a great deal of satisfaction just watching this beer for a couple of minutes before even drinking it. The aroma is, at first sniff, all orange and pineapple juice, but there's a level of dank, spicy complexity that you don't perceive in prototypical juice bombs like those from Tree House. Something about Swish begs, even dares, you to take a sip to confirm its awesomeness. And awesome it is: I can't think of another beer that zips so fully between bright, lovely fruit notes and dark, bitter stank. Just when you think the hops are tipping over into harshness, they pull back into a gentle, floral caress. Unlike some NE IPAs, it doesn't slide into one-dimensionality as it warms. Instead (to my palette), it gets more complex, even aggressive, as it goes, becoming downright pungent near the end. The best way I can describe its mouthfeel is ""zippy,"" even frantic, as it hits the tongue, but it leaves the palette completely clean within a couple of seconds; it almost feels like you hadn't drunk anything just a moment before. Which, of course, leads to its massive, dangerous drinkability.  I can't remember being this infatuated with a beer since my first Heady. Like Mr. Topper, it's completely unique, basically incomparable to anything else. So why not a perfect score? It's hard for me to explain, but I think it has something to do with the rapid vanishing of both the taste and mouthfeel. In a funny way, it doesn't ""stay"" with you the way certain beers stay with you. Which, again, could be dangerous, especially at 8%. To sum up, ready access to this beer would probably turn me into an alcoholic. Good thing it's damn hard to obtain.",0.6471622215052116,4.75,0.9972
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Had this out of a bottle at the Portland International Beerfest in July. $7 for four ounces was a bit steep, but was excited to tick this one.   Appearance: Pink and ruby hued spritzy brew, looking somewhat goofy next to the 14% stouts being served at the booths surrounding it. Somewhat like a Cherry 7-Up, but murkier and with very lively carbonation.  Smell: Tart and sweet cherries are accompanied by cavity-inducing sourness in the nose. Horse blanket funk is present as well, but lactic sour holds its own against the brettier notes.   Taste: Sour, certainly, and sweetness from the cherries. Sourness is somewhat layered as well, with the more bracing sourness never really tearing the enamel off your teeth. I think I'm having this beer too young, to be fair; the sweetness is still quite high, and the yeast with another year or three on that would pump out more of the sours, and allow the cherry-flavors to come through without being so offset by somewhat cloying sweetness. Still, really was hitting the spot on a hot afternoon, just not head-and-shoulders above its competition at this point.   Mouthfeel: Sour, tart, and finishing very lightly, with cherry notes on your tongue. Never gets medicinal, which is very appreciated. The sweetness doesn't adversely affect the finish either, and seems to solidify my guess that this beer would be served quite well by a little more time in the cellar.  Overall: Enjoyable, light, sour, and interesting, but I'm left wanting to try this in a vertical-style setting, where we can really see the beauty of the yeast taking the edge off of the sweetness. Worth seeking out if for no other reason than to forget about it for a while and tackle it on a warm day...as it's tasty now, and I can only imagine how tasty it'd be later.",0.6762284128618113,4.5,0.9972
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"2015 Vintage, Bottle Run 2: into a snifter, it pours blood red color as it's leaving the bottle but looks black in the glass with a 1 finger foamy tan/brown head that was full of tiny bubbles, dissipating very slowly and leaving good spotty lacing that slides down on the side I drank from and foamy rings on the other side.   Smells of chocolate, bourbon, oak barrels, peat moss, coffee grinds, cocoa powder, espresso, vanilla, smoked grains, charred wood, hot fudge or brownies, earthy notes and some faint piney hops. The bourbon is very present but not dominating, letting the smoked malts and chocolate malts swirl into a complex and wonderful aroma. Like the other FiftyFifty Eclipse variants I've had, this aroma was excellent and what I expected.  Tastes similar to the nose with rich chocolate, bourbon, oak barrels, peat moss, coffee grinds, Hershey's chocolate syrup, cocoa powder, espresso, vanilla, and then some fruity notes like raisin, dates and plums, wet tobacco, brown sugar, molasses, candied sugar or Belgian yeast, and then more vanilla and coffee. The Elijah Craig bourbon whiskey taste is distinct and meshes so well with the roasted malts, barrel notes and hop accents that it leans towards the spirit flavors slightly over the beer base. After each swallow the vanilla shows up again along with toasted coconut, maple syrup, brown sugar and smoked grains. The longer it sits the better it gets, and the hops come out more with some piney notes, lemon zest, tea leaf and peppery spices. The ABV is masked completely and this is a slow sipper that I wanted to somehow drink at a pace below slow so more dynamic flavors could come out an hour later. That didn't work out (slowing it down), but this was a great brew which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Mouthfeel is creamy and buttery smooth to the point of being slick as it slides down with mild carbonation, a light alcohol burn and a thick, chewy feel that makes the body seem heavy even though it's only medium to heavy. There is a slight bitterness that's coffee-esque, with a finish that trails off on the sweet side and has a nice mix of cocoa, brown sugar, piney hops, toffee, bourbon, smoked wood and vanilla. It fades like a Frappuccino with a shot of bourbon in it and a sprinkle of dry citrus hops and roasted chocolate malts. It really was a pleasure to dink and a beer I highly recommend and will seek out again.",0.6438289343988822,5.0,0.9972
Sure Bet,"bomber bottle poured into HF wine stem.  batch# 710-711.  Appearance: Completely opaque orange bodied beer. This beer looks exactly like orange juice, especially if this beer did not have any head. Bone white colored head that pours three fingers tall. Great head retention that slowly drops down to a thick, but uneven cap leaving heavy clumps of lacing on the glass.  Smell: Sweet oranges, mango's, and pineapple go on for ever in the aroma of this DIPA. Bready malts and honey covered biscuits are representatives of the malt profile and sweetness for the aroma. AND even a little bit of dankness from those hops just for good measure. This beer smells absolutely ridiculous!  Taste: Almost but not quite a moderate level of bitterness. Hops are perfectly balanced with the malt profile. Loads of juicy juicy mango's and pineapple, a nice sweet orange/tangerine presence is noted as well; a hint of honey and bready malts impart some sweetness to balance the hop profile. The malt profile acts like a blank canvas for the hops, mango's, and honey to be showcased; all in a perfect harmony. The dankness of the hops comes through in the finish and you also taste an orange zest note which adds a light, but lingering bitterness to the finish. The balance of flavors in this DIPA is absolutely insane and delicious.  Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation levels. Really easy drinking DIPA; if I didn't know any better, I would have thought this was an APA. No booze at all and its almost 10% abv. Geez... You can literally gulp this beer down it is that drinkable.   Overall: Sure Bet is the best hoppy beer that Pipeworks brews. It is even better than squared grouper hands down and I think that squared grouper is fantastic as well. This is gotta be the best hoppy beer that is brewed in the midwest beer region. The mango's in this beer are extremely well balanced and the honey accentuates the sweetness of the malt profile to balance out bitterness of the hop profile it is absolute genius by pipeworks. I am pretty excited by the fact that this is a local shelf turd; I will be revisiting a bomber of this again as often as pipeworks brews a new batch. That's a guarantee. Highly recommend that you try this beer. Beg, barrow, or steal to get a taste. Seriously.",0.6845643459891021,4.5,0.9972
Beatification,"Russian River Beatification (Batch 005)  I was fortunate enough to score a couple of these from the recent release so a big thanks to my cousin Dan for sending these down from NorCal! Beatification pours a wonderful hazy golden straw color, subtle hues of honey and orange, a thin bubbly white head surfaces, about a finger or so, but dissipates within seconds leaving a vapid layer of film atop the beer. The aroma is fantastic, pungent barnyard funk, wild yeast, sour fruits, acidic citrus, very tropical. It does smell very reminiscent of a gueuze, but so juicy and fruit, not dry at all, I was expecting to have some champagne like dry apples and butter in the nose, but was greeted with some wonderful wet, juicy sour fruit, I could keep my nose in the glass all night. The flavors are just as rewarding, it starts with some wonderful fruit flavors such as pineapple, mango, or papaya, but moves towards some bright citrus, hints of grapefruit, but very lemon heavy. The yeasty funk is less apparent in the flavors, but it does add a nice subtle layer of complexity to the fruitiness and doesn't leave behind any unpleasant aftertastes or dryness. The body is nice, the carbonation is actually very mild, but the acidity and sour profile gives it a feeling as if it were carbonated at higher levels.  Verdict: My words don't do this beer justice, it's truly unbelievable and the hype and hysteria is most certainly deserved. This is quite possibly Russian River's best sour offering and with an already impressive lineup of sour beer, it really is saying something. Whether you call it a Gueuze or an American Wild Ale, this is a must try at all costs for any sour lover.",0.6818081007995769,4.5,0.9972
Oude Geuze Vintage,"750ml bottle, 2008 vintage, poured into a Drie Fonteinen fountains tumbler glass. Enjoyed on 1.28.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal.  The beer pours a hazy and cloudy copper color, big foamy white head, good retention, great lace clings to the glass. The aroma is super frunky, excellent expression of that distinct Drie funk that is so earthy yet citrusy and complex, lightly floral and herbal notes come forward with oak, green aged hops with some soft wheaty grain. The aroma is super bright and delicate, a really excellent display of what Drie is capable of. The flavors are excellent as well, great funk, dry dirty leaves, musty oak, bright citrus and an excellent floral character lingers well with some soft grain. The mouthfeel is great, very lively and crisp that coats very well with a tart and dry finish.  Verdict: A stunning gueuze from Drie Fonteinen. Excellent complexity, beautiful expression of funk with tons of depth bringing out nuances of fruit, oak, spice and grassiness, really delicious and special stuff.",0.7320140226915101,4.5,0.9972
Vicinity,"Trillium Vicinity  A: Surprisingly, this NE IIPA from the kings of the style does not pour completely opaque, instead opting for only a slightly hazy, brilliant golden-orange color. Two-and-a-half fingers of meringue-like head sits atop and has really nice retention. Lacing is equally impressive. There are obvious particles floating within, bounced around by the lazy-yet-plentiful carbonation. Per style, it should really be a bit hazier, but otherwise this is perfect. 4.75/5  A: Mango, orange, papaya, tangerine, lime, pineapple, and peach all burst forth from the glass in constant waves. Underneath lies a weedy dankness and a little alcohol sweetness. No real malt aromas are noticeable, but the sheer complexity of the hops (and probably fruity ale yeast contributions) really makes this incredible. The alcohol presence seems a bit much for only 8%, however. 4.5/5  T: Plenty of the same tropical-heavy fruits of the aroma, plus a great and very welcome contribution of juicy and bitter red grapefruit. Melon shows up toward the end of the flavor with the dank and pithy bitterness, along with a little indiscriminate herbaceousness. Malt sweetness is unnoticeable since it blends imperceptibly with the hops and creates a wonderful juiciness. Again, there is an alcoholic note on the end that is slightly unwelcome due to the relatively low ABV and how well it is hidden in other beers of similar ABV; this is a minor gripe, however. 4.75/5  M: Medium, slick, soft, and creamy are all applicable terms here. Carbonation is natural and soft, perhaps a little on the low end but not at all in a bad way. Dryness is slight, leaving the finish somewhat sticky and syrupy, making the beer seem much bigger than it is. This may be a bit of a flaw, but it somehow does not seem as detrimental as it could be in other beers. 4.25/5  O: This is a fantastic IIPA from perhaps the best brewer of this style. While it is not perfect, it does approach that and belongs in the conversation for the best to come out of the movement. There is so much juicy complexity that it is almost overwhelming, and it is almost perfectly balanced with the dankness that shows up later. It is truly remarkable how well Trillium integrates the overt hoppiness with the malts in a way that they worth together rather than being somewhat separate entities as in some other NE IPAs. Equally remarkable is how they wring unique flavors out of very similar, Galaxy-dominated hop bills. Pair with The Wonder Years ""The Upsides"" for being awesome but not quite game-changing. 4.5/5",0.7211244624210242,4.5,0.9972
Beatification,"After finding no time to make it up to the brewery to buy some bottles of this last December, imagine my surprise when, during a family visit to the brewery, that they were still tapping this! Couldn't ask for a better turn of events - this has been one of my all-time wants since I ever started getting into sours and gueuze beers. Batch 6. Poured into a tulip tumbler glass at the brewery.  Pours a faded amber color with some straw hues, as well as a slight golden glimmer when held against the light. Cloudy, with some noticeable carbonation at first that dies down alongside its initially frothy white head. Not much lacing, and if it weren't for its cloudy appearance it would retain the same look of a low alcoholic white wine. Hmm, previous batch pours (mainly from bottles) definitely indicated that this was more vinous looking in the past, but I'm not too concerned. Sour beers are very different from the bottle than they are on tap, and hopefully I'll be able to try a bottle of this to compare notes to.  Yeah, the aroma nails it, however - this is as good of an interpretation on the style as any world class gueuze I have tried from Belgium, and if this isn't enough reassurance that perhaps knowing how to make wine (as Vinnie does) isn't perhaps the best path to take before committing to brewing wild ales, I don't know what is. Huge notes of musty peaches, apricots, white raisins, and, of course, yellow apples and pears. A big dank cellar aroma is predominant, with notes of old, cold stone (I'm thinking slate), damp hay, leather, and a damp cloth aroma. This is brief, however, and the finish is filled with nice notes of toasted tobacco, vanilla, toffee, and a little bit of something floral, maybe herbal, from the fresh hops. Crisp, warm, and inviting. An excellent effort.  Wow, one sip and I'm immediately assured that this is one of the most drinkable wild ales being made in this country. This is so fruity, funky, sour, and yet so refreshing and comfortable to drink! At first, there's the large apple and pear notes, followed by some white nectarines and a bit of orange melon (all soured or under-ripe, of course), with some brief peppery sensations, as well as nice white floral notes. Sour and acetic, but also a bit lactic from the barrel aging. The funk then takes over in the middle of the mouth, delivering grassy, wet hay flavors that are earthy and quite mineral, with a crisp and cooling sensation at the same time. The finish is more funky, but also melds with the toffee, vanilla, and leather profile quite gracefully and balanced. Extremely creamy and filling from the yeast, but also crisp, and palate-cleansing - the white vinegar finish definitely does its work well. In spite of its acidity, this is gentle on the senses, and makes a terrifically approachable. Delicious stuff!  I knew other sours made by RR were already world-class, but this really took it home for me. This is not an easy beer to make, and to produce something that is so complex and yet so brightly textured and balanced when working with wild bacterial strains is nothing short of magic. For those who have had any doubt on the direction that wild beers are taking in America, try this one and be astonished. This is by far the leader of many beautiful things to come. I hope to get a bottle soon and compare some notes, and see how this changes over time.",0.6799319262194892,4.5,0.9971
Chocolate Rain,"750mL bottle acquired through the Reserve Society. The Bruery has apparently stopped bottle dating but this is the 2013 vintage just released in April. Served in a Red Brick snifter.   Pours jet black with about one finger of brown head. Head receds to a tiny halo which doesn't lace. Swirling my glass shows nice thick legs that fade slowly.   Smells incredible! Bourbon chocolate cake and vanilla dominate with oak, roast and booze thrown in.   The nose, while excellent, couldn't prepare me for how awesome this tastes. Rich chocolate cake, strong yet smooth bourbon, vanilla bean ice cream, sweet creamed coffee, booze soaked dark fruit, heavy roasted malts, that kind of funky sweet almost signature Bruery yeast character and a little alcohol burn. So freakin delicious with the rich flavors coating my tongue. The alcohol is present but this drinks so smooth like only half of it's 18% abv bill.   Thick, heavy, chewy, viscous feel with light carbonation. Coats the mouth for a long, sweet bourbon chocolate cake aftertaste.   Truly outstanding! This was one of the main reasons I joined the Reserve Society and I couldn't be happier. So rich and full. Even better than the already stellar Black Tuesday. Very highly recommended.",0.6511077931873972,4.75,0.9971
Black Tuesday,"750ml bottle from 2012, about 6oz poured into a snifter at Dustin's birthday tasting yesterday, 6.15.2013.  Aroma: Lots of bourbon and heat, which dominates the nose. But there are marshmallows and tons of chocolate, very sweet. It basically smelled like bourbon smores. Interesting! I thought the heat was really off-putting, but altogether this beer has a really, sweet and complex nose.  Colour: Pitch black, like a black hole. Not much of a head at all, which is not surprising for a high gravity beer like this. There isn't even a collar, and there isn't any lacing at all when I swirl it around. Its black, that's all I can expect from a beer called Black Tuesday.  Flavour: Really, really sweet. Like mentioned before, it tastes like a crap ton of chocolate, bourbon and a little vanilla sweetness. There's a lot going on here, but the best way to put it is hot, hot bourbon smores. It all comes together well, not all that cloying. Deliciously bourbony and malty!  Mouthfeel: Thinner bodied but full of flavour. Actually quite well carbonated for a giant stout like this. Aftertaste is mostly all the malty sweetness that I experienced while swishing this beer along my palate. Its pretty much dessert. Really, the biggest problem with this beer is that it's so damn boozy. I know its a 19.2% beer, but it was just a beer that took a long time to finish. Still, so black and thick... gotta say this is a hell of a mouthfeel.  Overall: Delicious. It's like drinking bourbon and port together. Thick thick beer that is very sweet but not cloyingly so. As mentioned above, the problem is that its got too much alcohol in it- I can smell it in the nose immediately as its being poured, and it definitely gets hotter as it gets warmer. I think its a deliciously sweet barrel-aged big stout but for the $36 it costs per bottle, I'll take 6 bottles of BCBS. It's not a very good value IMO (which does not detract from the overall scoring in this review), but I'm glad to have at least tried it.",0.6345943316987293,4.5,0.9971
Very GGGreennn,"Big thanks to rudzud for hooking me up, canned 6/07/19 Pours a big foamy bubbly semi dense large head that retains forever, good soapy lacing as well, cloudy opaque murky tan-gold color  Nose is everything I could have ever wanted in the style, loads of super juicy tropical fruits, tons of pineapple mostly, but also a strong passion fruit and mango/papaya note, a bit of a doughy base malt and creamy, little citrus and peach  Taste hits right in stride, super juicy with loads of tropical fruits, pineapple passion fruit smoothie like, some citrus and a little pith, orange mango sherbet, papaya and mango juice, a little cantaloupe, with a little doughy creamy base malt, a touch of chalky minerals with the pith, low bitterness and almost no alcohol, plenty of creamy doughy malt to prop up the hops, drying on the finish with tons more tropical fruits and some citrus, a little green like spicy hop as well that likely dropped a bit since it was super fresh and this would probably be even better after another week, light bitterness lingering  Mouth is super lush creamy rich, like a smoothie but without the lactose or protein gritty feel, creamy soft carbonation almost like nitro but without the nitro taste, almost no alcohol  Overall, definitely reminds me of the early days when they were first making new IPAs and changing the entire style of the beer, and I was so excited to go down to Munson every Saturday and just fill a few growlers of the new IPA, shoot the shit with the crew. Couldn't wait to try the new beers and gawk at how they got so much juicy fruit without bitterness and over malt characters, this just hearkens back to those days. Thanks for bringing beers like this to the table now and then, and continuing to remind me that even though I'm burnt out on the style, and almost all NEIPAs seem to blend into the same thing, this still somehow stands out and makes me happy again.",0.6764474430343265,4.75,0.9971
Coolship Red,"amazing brew here, as authentic a lambic as i have gotten from the united states, its sour, dry, funky, and unlike even some of the best belgian ones, it is beautifully carbonated. the use of raspberries here is lovely as well, not as intense as say an atrial rubicite, but used more elegantly and refined in a special way. the bright pink color of this is gorgeous, while the white head on it is fluffy and permanent, with a certain enticing character. it smells as good as any raspberry beer out there, tart from the fruit, but also very sour from the wild yeasts and critters, which manifest themselves in an acidic and lactic mouthwatering aroma. the flavor is sour beer first, raspberry next, but the fruit stays all the way through the finish and slings to the edges of my mouth as the rest of it is dried out completely. such a clean finish for a beer this flavorful. the yeast profile is amazing, as good as any, thats the point of this coolship project from what i understand, to make very authentic and delicious wild yeast ales, this is so punchy and juicy and sour and awesome, i wish they would distribute to colorado, what a gem this beer is. nearly flawless on the overall, i cant think of a single thing i would change.",0.7136746045755157,4.75,0.997
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout," pours like you might think. Black, viscous(like really, used cold engine oil thick) and next to no head. It coats like none I have ever seen.  S: First thing I noticed was the coffee, then the sweet maple, bourbon and a hint of chocolate. It isn't as aggressive in smell as say, Double Stack, but it is certainly strong when it gets poured.   T: I docked it a little bit here because everything on the nose was perfection. I felt barrel presence was lacking in taste. I wanted this to still taste bourbon like with the other adjuncts. Everything else was on point with the nose, except in different order. Maple was first and foremost. Really nicely sweet. Then came the coffee in a nice robust, but not overpowering, fashion. It was there enough to accent and mix. After that the dark chocolate mixed in and added a nice bitter richness to the whole experience.   F: So...it's not quite natural/real maple syrup viscous, but it is damn close. It is the thickest beer I've ever had. A wonderful coating mouth feel that lingers for days. If you're sharing this, I'd recommend a small number of bottles before and this last. But then again, other things might give it a run for its money here. I don't know.   Overall, I'd go through the trouble of getting it again from the brewery. I don't think I'd trade to get one though. It is fantastic. I sipped on mine for over 2 hours and I loved it going from cold to warm. The character change and adjuncts shining through was an absolute treat. I've never had anything close to it in thickness or character. My one gripe, preventing my perfect score, was the lack of barrel in taste. Other than that, perfection in a bottle.",0.6417396412179689,5.0,0.997
Green,"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 3/8/2018. Pours opaquely hazy golden orange/amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with awesome retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Thick soapy lacing clings on the glass, with fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of huge tangerine, grapefruit, orange juice, lemon, lime, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, biscuit, white bread dough, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, grapefruit, orange juice, lemon, lime, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, biscuit, white bread dough, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very mild pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, orange juice, lemon, lime, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, biscuit, white bread dough, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is fantastic. Zero warming alcohol for 7.5%. Overall this is an insane NEIPA! All around amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; very smooth and refreshing to drink, with the mildly bitter/drying finish, never aggressive. Amazing soft spot on mouthfeel for the style. Extremely juicy, vibrant, and dank/earthy balanced hop complexity; great bready malt backbone, not overly sweet/heavy. A highly amazing offering, and perfect style example. One of the best I have had.",0.693608361080501,4.5,0.997
Beatification,"Eric... what else can I possibly say but thanks! I am ever grateful for this, one of my most sought after beers. Thanks.   375ml. Batch 001. Gentile first pour yields a glowing and absolutely radiant clear, bright, copper/gold liquid with virtually no head and just the smallest appearance of carbonation. Aroma yields loads of tart acicity. Moldy tropical fruit. Wet dog. Foot and BO. Aged cheesy stank. Very light barnyard impression. Musty, acidic basement? The citrus component and funk of the brett and wood really play off each other wonderfully. Doughy, champagne-like yeasty malt quality. Wet rocks and gravel. Shit, I could smell this all day. Acidic, tart and rather minerally on the palate. Tart pineapple, plenty of wood tannin. Acidic, horsey, funky and damn near gueuze-like. As with the nose, the citrus, barrel and yeast aspects all melt together rather seamlessly. The malt component really reminds me of a doughy and bready Champagne, a la Bollinger. Plenty of spritzy carbonation all leading to a fantastically dry, funky, earthy, acidic and rocky finish.  With the yeast added the nose becomes a lot more musty and dank, losing a lot of the citrus component and adding a wholly wonderful layer of cheesy, animal, barnyard funk. Cheesier and moldier on the palate as well. The wood seems to come out more as well. Acidity is toned down on the finish, but the flavor and tangy yeast linger on the tongue for quite a while. Most excellent, but I prefer the bright tang and acidity of the top half of the bottle. Regardless, this a true world class example of the sour ale style and ranks up there with the best of them. Thanks again Eric!  Batch 2: 375ml Bottle. Initial review of the top half of the bottle before the yeast pours. Holy shit! What a insanely funky and over the top nose! Tart, juicy citrus, white pepper, wood, brett, horse blanket, cow poop, farm. Absolutely wonderful in its complexity. Pours a clear gold. Nearly still. Nearly perfect. Shimmering in all its awesomeness. Flavor is tart and acidic beyond belief. Pineapple, brett, sour, funky. Awesome!  After the yeast. More musty notes emerge. More basement and less farm. Pungent and potent as all hell. White pepper notes emerge. Grapefruit skin. White grape skin and tannin. Assloads of tannic wood. Still acidic but a tad more lush and creamy. Dusty and gravely. Out-freaking-standing! Thanks Mark!",0.6985999416277267,4.5,0.997
Vicinity,"I stopped into the Fort Point location to get some Secret Stair, and they didn't have any. After describing what I generally like (strong ales - Double, triple, quad generally Belgian in style and Stouts) not overly bitter and hoppy. I have had some Double IPA's that I really like Six Point Resin, and my local Sip of Sunshine by Lawson's - Heady is just a little much for me. This Double IPA sounded great, but just didn't hit the mark.  The look is wonderful straw colored and murky, can't see my fingers around the glass thick. Poured with a nice creamy head that lingers - looks great, good start...  The smell - As soon as I popped the cap I could smell the grapefruit and other citrus rising from the bottle, it was enticing me to love this drink...  The taste following the smell, was a good complex flavor of Citrus, fruity, malty great front end - then the bitter, hoppy after bite - just what I said I didn't want. I prefer it smooth. This is not as hoppy as Heady I could finish it and I've been know to pour out a Heady.  The feel was thick creamy and full in the mouth, with a mild carbonation that felt good. Not as effervescent as I would generally want but satisfying.   Overall, For me this was an OK beer. There are many I would turn to first - Like Sip of sunshine - on a hot day. but if you are looking for a flavorful citrus IPA with a bitter bite you could do worse than this.  I am interested now in the others that they sold me, Metal, Heavy Metal and Pot & Kettle - will they be as bitter? We shall see...",0.6795773848092552,3.5,0.997
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Low carbonation, attractive, but the immediately dissipating head renders it less than perfect.   Nice nose, pleasant, impressive. In relative terms to other absolute top tier stouts, it hangs around with them. Lovely, but not a clear stand alone...not a rose among thorns.   Great mouthfeel. Hard to separate from melted chocolate. If i could give the mouthfeel a 6/5, i might.   Everything you'd want in a stout. Thick. Declicious. Flavorful. I'm not adding any new information saying tastes of maple, coffee, chocolate, and barrel...the label says much.   Its hard to knock this beer in any category, its outstanding, awesome, amazing, super, and delicious. Among all beers, its in that highest tier, it doesn't however separate itself within that tier (creating a new tier). It is perhaps the best beer I've ever had, at a minimum in the top 10 discussion, however a case could be made for D6, MBP, DBH b1...all in the same ballpark.",0.6703455396187346,5.0,0.997
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Been wanting to try this one for a while. The regular version of James Rolfe (the angry video game nerd)'s favorite beer. I heard many good things about it, had to give this one a try. Got a case from Market District for $12, which was a more than reasonable price. Doing this review on the spot.  Poured into a tall glass, its very pure looking. Faint yellow, massive head, very carbonated. The head lingers a long while. The first sip burns. This is a very carbonated beer. The flavor is great upon first impressions, no bitter beer taste, virtually no hops presence. You know its a wheat beer from drinking it. I have heard others say they got hints of bubblegum and banana from this? Not me. Its citrusy, its wheaty, its good. But I would definitely not say its sweet. Its an excellent sipping beer on a warm summer night.  Look: Quite beautiful. Looks like the perfect beer should look. Massive head, bubbly, beautiful yellow color.  Smell: citrusy, pure, literally can smell the history behind the beer. Its no surprise this stuff has been around for so long.  Taste: Delish. An outstanding beer taste. Not bitter one bit. Some citrus hints underneath the carbonation (which assaults the tongue) and a great finish which leaves you begging for more.  Feel: Ouch. Burning sensation from the carbonation which I find to be stimulating. I am used to belgian ales. Anyone that drinks bottle conditioned trappist ales are used to this feeling. I expect it and look forward to it.  Overall: Outstanding beer. Its the best of all worlds, though I am a belgian ale/trappist ale kind of guy, and also love pumpkin ales, this is probably my go-to beer now if I am not forking over all my money for expensive trappist ales or when pumpkin ale is out of season. This is for the serious beer drinker who drinks for the appreciation of a fine brew. Put down the Budweiser and give this a try, you won't regret it.",0.6220788126610699,4.75,0.997
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Poured from tap into Chalice approximately 12 ounces.  A. Poured maybe a half finger of very dark tan head by the time it arrived to my hands. Not much lacing. Color is jet black.  S. Whiskey, oak, vanila, molasses, roasted malt, chocolate. Not overpowering on the aroma. Not a whole lot of whiskey barrel on the nose, but does impart subtlety. This beer reminds me of Bourbon County Stout in a lot of ways, which is saying something about this beer. Nice smooth smelling beer for a barrel aged imperial stout.  T. T. Nice whiskey, bourbon hints. Smooth. Oak, vanilla, chocolate, alcohol. Nice vanilla, milk chocolate sweetness. Tongue coating flavor. Again this reminds me of a smoother Bourbon County for some reason. I had one of these beers on Friday afternoon, and thought about it so much I had to go back and get another one on Saturday. Really big beer with a lot of flavors, but still smooth.  M. Full bodied. Tongue coating sweetness. Medium low carbonation.   O. Damn good Imperial Stout. This beer made me crave having another one. Smooth but great whiskey flavor. This is really as good as a lot of the best barrel aged stouts that I have had. Mouth coating flavor. Really smooth for 13%. I found a lot of similarites to BCBS for some reason, but I can not remember BCBS ever being this smooth fresh. Having had Kentucky Brunch makes me very excited to try my bottles of Assasin. Kentucky Brunch needs to be put in a bottle soon. Toppling Goliath is putting out some really good beers.  5/6/12 Bottled Version  Poured from 12oz bottle into Globe glass.  A. Poured about a half finger of head. Color is jet black. Moderate lacing. Not much head retention.  S. Smells like bourbon. Coffee, vanilla, chocolate. Smells like I remember it on tap. Does smell a little hot. Molasess, roasted malt. Pretty heavy cofee aroma.   T. Coffee, vanilla, roasted malt, bitter dark chocolate. Not super boozy on the taste, but you can fell that it is there. Really nice chocolate flavor on the back of the tongue. Big time flavor.   M. Nice mouthfeel. Full bodied, close to being called chewy. Lingering bitterness on the finish. Low carbonation.  O. Lots of coffee flavor going on. Nice barrel aged characteristics as well. This was a delicous beer on tap, that really impressed me. Nothing different about this beer out of the bottle.

Todd The Axe Man,"Currently #108 on the Top 250 beers list.  CAN: 1 pint format. Aluminum. Standard pull-tab. Metal-inspired label design. Canned 01/27/17.  7.20% ABV. ""India pale ale."" Brewed with Citra and Mosaic hops.  Served cold into a tulip per the label's instructions.  HEAD: ~5-6cm in height. Frothy and creamy, with a soft yet robust consistency. Recedes within 8 minutes, leaving no lacing. I've seen frothier and fuller more inviting heads, but this is to style.  BODY: Nontransparent. No yeast/lees are visible within, but it does seem unfiltered. Translucent. Colour is a pale copper-orange.  Appears well-carbonated. Not a unique or special appearance for an IPA, but a generally appealing one.  AROMA: I don't think either citra or mosaic hops are particularly well showcased, with this lacking the fresh pungent citrus and blueberry you'd expect from those hops. It offers only mild aromas of both along with some oniony and floral aromatics. I guess some of the kids these days might refer to this aroma as ""dank"" given its suggestiveness of a coating, fruity, deeply flavoured hoppy brew, but I'd have to refrain myself.  If anything, onion is dominant in this aroma, bringing it more into line with a simcoe-hopped IPA than a citra or mosaic hopped expression of the style. Aromatic intensity is moderate.  TASTE & TEXTURE: More tropical in its fruit profile than classically citrusy, emphasizing mango and tangerine above classic orange or grapefruit. Oniony indeed; I'd guess this was brewed with simcoe in a blind tasting. Mosaic's signature subtle blueberry is absent here to its detriment, but I guess the Mosaic does contribute some of that less interesting tropical fruit flavour. Floral as well. The warm boozy pineapple I despise in IPAs does emerge here, unfortunately.  All hop bitterness is balanced nicely by the pale malt backbone, and I think I find some caramalt in there too.  A very coating medium-bodied mouthfeel emphasizes the onion. A more fresh zesty acidic texture would play better to the citrus. Could be softer and more oily. Smooth and wet, but not too refreshing. Overcarbonated. Not gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, harsh, rough, or scratchy.  The mouthfeel suits the taste well enough without elevating the beer as a whole. There's no ideal harmony of flavour, but this texture does the job and doesn't get in the way of the flavours.  Far from the most complex IPA out there, let alone within Surly's own impressive lineup. I'm not too thrilled with the hop profile, and that comes as a shock seeing as Citra and Mosaic are some of my favourite hop varietals.  OVERALL: Fails to deliver on its Citra and Mosaic hop premise as well as the best expressions of the style (and since those hops in particular are so popular as of late, it's an easy comparison to make). Even single hop Mosaic beers like Lone Pint's Yellow Rose easily exceed this in terms of quality, but regardless it's a drinkable enjoyable take on the style and I'll enjoy finishing the 4 pack I bought. As much as I adore Surly, I can't count this as amongst the best beers in the style, nor would I recommend it to friends over more widely available and more affordable go-to IPAs from the likes of Deschutes, Lagunitas, and others, but I'm glad I tried it once and I wouldn't mind trying it fresh on-draught. If it disappoints, that's only because we've come to expect the best from Surly...and they so often rise to the challenge.  C+ (3.25) / ABOVE AVERAGE",0.7207713121303361,3.25,0.9969
Beatification,"Thanks to Adam for busting this great brew out at an impromptu tasting!  Appearance: Pours a perfectly clear golden color with 1/4"" of white head. Carbonation is there, but fairly minimal for the style. Head retention is nice, as a nice layer remains throughout the duration of the beer. The clarity and clear, warm color make the appearance of this beer very nice.   Smell: Smells of lemons, tartness, some pale fruitiness (maybe some mango and peach), slight funk and light mustiness. Pretty nicely balanced between the tartness, funk and fruit character.  Taste: Some initial sweetness that is slightly peachy with some mango, followed by lemony tartness, slight funk, and a very sour finish. This beer definitely has more lacto sourness than brett funk, as the taste lacks funk and mustiness for the most part. A very good taste, but wish it had that extra gear. Still, good.  Overall/Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is perfect. Light bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, a damn nice wild that I was excited to try, and would definitely have again.",0.7019588328506227,4.5,0.9969
Black Tuesday,"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 9/18/2013. Pours opaque dark brown/black color with a small foamy khaki head with decent retention, that reduces to a ring of lace that lingers. Minimal lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, fudge, brown sugar, maple syrup, almond, molasses, vanilla, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, dark bread, raisin, plum, cherry, fig, and date; with light notes of marshmallow, licorice, smoke, pepper, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. A bit of increasing booziness in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Damn nice complexity and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, fudge, brown sugar, maple syrup, almond, molasses, vanilla, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, dark bread, raisin, plum, cherry, fig, and date; with light notes of marshmallow, licorice, smoke, char, pepper, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate bourbon/oak spiciness and light roast/char bitterness on the the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, fudge, brown sugar, maple syrup, almond, molasses, vanilla, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, dark bread, dark fruit, marshmallow, light smoke/char, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Mildly increasing dryness from bourbon/oak spiciness. Medium carbonation and very full body; with a very creamy/silky/velvety/rich, and lightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is awesome. Alcohol is very well hidden; a lightly increasing warmth of 18.9%, with mild lingering barrel booziness after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged imperial stout! All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the enormous ABV. Bruery stouts always seem to have a class of their own on the flavor profile. Not as deeply roasty or charred on black/roasted malts like some others; but still extremely rich and complex. Outstanding barrel integration and balance, without feeling overly boozy, tannic, or drying. A highly enjoyable offering.",0.6659410518514255,4.0,0.9969
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"My buddy snagged a sample of this for me, along with regular DL for both of us, while I was standing in line for bottles. Thanks Beast!  On-tap in the parking lot into a plastic cup, then transferred to my tasting tulip.  A: Viscous black body with some nice dark brown foam. Looks amazing.  S: Very sweet, very potent aroma of roasted malts (lots of chocolate, some coffee), bourbon, vanilla, and oak. Lovely.  T: Follows the nose, with restrained booze overseeing a luscious medley of sweet, malty, oaky, bourbony goodness. Awesome.  M: Smooth, thick, creamy body. Sticky, but enjoyable, with expectedly low carbonation.  D: Super sweet and super strong, but the oak aging makes this tasty enough to make me want far more than the small sample. Considering how many high-test beers I've sampled today, though, that probably isn't the best idea.  Notes: This is an awesome, delicious beer, and is far more impressive than this years fresh regular DL. While I look forward to seeing how that ages (and I have very high hopes), there's no question that today this is the more delectable beverage. I'm still kicking myself for not getting in line for the Vanilla Bean DL right away, though. Here's hoping I can make it back next year!  Cheers!",0.656945670126385,4.0,0.9969
Chocolate Rain,"Notes from a tasting on 8/15. not sure who brought this one, but i can tell you that it was far and away the highlight of the tasting. i had a batch 2 recently (review still needs to be added), and i can tell you it is a different beer entirely from batch 1. batch 2 is not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but batch 1 is simply magic in a bottle.  Batch #1!!!  a - poured a watery black with no head at all, looks kind of sludgy, but has that darkness of the devil's soul.  s - a hint of rubbing alcohol with a salm in the face of amazing gourmet chocolate and the perfect dosage of vanilla glazed on top. some toasted coconut in the background to round out the nose. really just marvellous, my mouth is watering.  t - HOLY MOLY!!! Huge vanilla with rich decadent chocolate. Still pretty hot, but beautiful. everything is in it's right place. the vanilla is divine. not a vanilla bomb, but a dessert.  m - a bit hot, but silky smooth. for a beer this huge, it blows you away how great it drinks.  o - FAR superior to batch 2. FAR FAR FAR superior. this beer is unreal. the entire group was floored by it and i don't think one of us didn't peg this as the top beer of the evening (and it was in good company with rare, black note, pappy eclipse, and other big guns). we even gave some sips to a table of ladies next to us and they too were blown away that ""a dark beer"" could taste so good. when we told them the ABV, they thought we were lying.",0.6079599626318892,5.0,0.9969
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"The beer pours a deliciously white and creamy head that dissipates at a moderate pace. It still leaves a good amount of beer around the inside of the glass. The beer itself is a cloudy and opaque medium orange that strongly resembles orange juice. It is beautiful.  The smell is fantastic. The smell has as fairly strong lime zest that comes out the strongest compared to the other notes with a wood note following it. The grapefruit is actually fairly mild compared to the other two but adds a good fruity complement.  The taste is really good but the smell is better. The zest isn't as strong as it is in the smell and actually comes out more in the finish. The wood note comes out strong when compared to the lime floral notes. The grapefruit notes are there but it is more of a unripe white grapefruit. It's still good but a bit light.  The feel is pretty good. It's a medium bodied beer with a dry finish because of a crisp carbonation. The beer itself has a good weight and goes down like orange juice does.  Overall, this is a pretty good beer and worth getting one's hands on giving the interesting lime note. Go for it.",0.6911146591945391,4.75,0.9969
Chocolate Rain,"Poured from the bottle into a teku glass. B #510 February 5th 2018.  Fleeting and sudsy tan head, that dissolves pretty quickly, to barely a thin collar. Interesting body color though. Opaque and dark but has this giant amount of purple to it somehow.  This is an interesting aroma. Wine like fruit flavors mixing in with an interesting cocoa bent. Rich dusting cocoa powder, almost husky and carob thick ripping on the nose. Not sweet at all, but not much barrrel hinting character on this. Impressive but not sure the angle this is going.  So down the hatch and what do we get? Big richness. Light bodied but with excellent silky quality and maybe a touch of cutting fizz, filling with rich flavors. Light warm touches of raspberry and cherry like kirsch heat, mixing with a dark decadent cocoa powder that blankets and even neutralizes the sweetness so perfectly. Rich dusting finish on the aftertaste, while large, doesn't come off as a hot boozy mess. I am literally feeling fine powder on my lips and tongue with this brew.  Impressive and punchy. Goes aggressive but with some control, but not without some sacrifices. Impressive stuff.",0.6969878232930226,4.5,0.9969
Sang Noir,"The beer pours a nice and interestingly colored head that dissipates quickly. The head seems to have a tan with purple hue, which is pretty interesting and unique. The beer itself is beautiful and strongly resembles a nice pinot with its brown and purple hues. The beer is obviously hard to see through because of the coloring but the texture is pretty nice.  The smell and taste are both fantastic. The smell and taste both contain a nice dose of dark cherry tart, pinot noir berry fruitiness, and a bit of whiskey. The pinot noir note seems to come out more in the smell while sacrificing the whiskey; unlike the taste, where the whiskey is a bit stronger but still gets lost in the dark cherry notes. The dark cherry notes dominate the taste along with the tartness and is supplemented by the barrel aging.  The feel is pretty good. It's a lighter bodied beer but it has a bit of heft to it that gives it a nice smooth body and keeps it from being watery. The strong tingling carbonation is nice and actually makes the tartness easier to tolerate.  Overall, this is a pretty good beer worth getting even if it is a little pricey. While the tart notes are a bit stronger than the other beers from this brewery, it is still an easy to drink beer. Go for it.",0.6839556725806011,4.5,0.9968

L: Pours a beautiful crystal clear golden caramel apricot color with a solid white head leaving good lacing. Delicate effervescent bubbles continue to rise up to the top. Did someone call for champagne?  S: Wet grassy resinous hops and peach-heavy tropical fruit aromas mingle with caramel malts. Touch of alcohol in the nose. The aroma is rather delicate and not as in-your-face as I like my IPAs to be, but quite inviting.  T: The taste follows as a bigger version of the nose as caramel malt sweetness hits the tongue first, accompanied by a pleasantly sharp but not overbearing punch of alcohol backed up by the prickly carbonation. Tropical fruit flavors of mango and pineapple settle in next and then transition to a dominant peach note, finally giving way to a wet resinous hoppy bitterness that sticks to the tongue well after each sip. Sweet biscuity malts are present throughout and provide a solid tasty backdrop for the hop train. Very nice.  F: Medium-bodied and sticky, and quite satisfying rolled across the palate. Carbonation is excellent and the bubbles are going straight to my head not halfway through the bomber.  O: This is a solid IIPA and tastes more complex with every sip as it warms. Devastatingly joyous? Perhaps. Well-crafted and delicious? Definitely. Great job, Stone. Will enjoy again next cycle!",0.6991819095915744,4.25,0.9968
Green,"Had in a tulip glass from a can dated 3/15/2016.  Look: Julius aint got nothing on this beer being hazy. This is nearly opaque. I hate the whole ""look of a beer"" debate going on right now but it isn't that golden haze that appeals to me. Granted, don't base the score of the look of the beer. More on that later. Smell: Pineapple. WOW PINEAPPLE. That is all I am getting from this. A little orange and a good bit of that hop aroma, but pineapple is straight in my nose. Good smelling beer again. Taste: Delicious. This is a ""where did my beer go"" kind of beer. It has a good upfront hop profile that dies a bit quick, but it isn't a palate wrecker like some beers out there. The malt backbone is nice and sweet. I could drink this beer constantly though. The alcohol is covered to a point I don't notice it at all, and the beer itself is quite refreshing. This is a fantastic beer. I will say I liked julius better, but this beer is a great beer.  Feel: This has a good mouthfeel. The hops don't overpower you and kill your mouth, and the sweetness of the malt is there on the aftertaste.  Overall: This is my third beer from Treehouse and they are straight killing it. I have a couple cans of Julius to confirm my opinion on that beer and lucked into getting one of the Green cans. I really enjoy this beer and will say this is a fantastic IPA. I love how it doesn't overkill my tastebuds, but rather gently massages it over the course of the drink. Again, quite jealous at the folks in MA.",0.6169585580801851,4.5,0.9968
Black Tuesday,"my first taste of the legendary Black Tuesday. had to fight the Bruery's server for it, but I finally got me a few bottles to try. very thick and heavy so I have a liter growler of Noble's Big Whig IPA as a chaser! vigorous pour results in a 1/2 finger of tan foam which subsides quickly. very dark, dark brown color.... all barrel smell after the pour. minimal soapy lace on the sides. very rich aroma of barrel, whiskey, roasted malts.... very nice aroma, though, want to continue wafting it in.... some chocolate here, but mostly the bourbon is what makes its mark. I wonder if it aged a bit if it would mellow any? definitely some strong flavors here with the near 19% abv but these are very nice flavors. vanilla, some dark fruit. very sweet. licorice? it says anise, but I don't get any of that. maybe some brown sugar? very thick flavor, almost syrup. for the abv, I suppose that is required.... well, I tasted the legendary Black Tuesday. finally. it is what I had expected after tasting some other Bruery labels. sweet, stout, strong. syrup-y. I planned ahead for this, even, by having the chaser ready to go.... it really goes well with all the left over Butterfingers and (especially) Almond Joys left over from Halloween. actually, I stole them from my kids' bags... and as a matter of contention, try a little Tootsie Roll with your Black Tuesday... really brings out the alcohol... and sugar. all in all, my first sip of this legend, a nice chaser, leftover Halloween candy, and football. what a great sunday! as jimmy buffett says (sings), I wish lunch could last forever...",0.6045671017331822,4.5,0.9968
Aaron,"A: Pours a deep murky brown color with a beige colored head. Head is somewhat creamy, has very decent volume considering the aging done on this beer but dissipates quite quickly to a ring.  S: This beer really needs to not be ice cold for the nose to open. Still, it's pretty faint. There are notes of leather, peacans, vanilla, pepper, oak, caramel and light smoke. Quite a bit of raisins, dates and figs and maybe even dried apricot? Very nice and coherent but pretty low on intensity.   T: What it lacks in smell intensity, it fucking gives back in taste. Jesus this beer is insane. It's insanely tasty with a ton of raisins, figs, dates and yes dried apricots. You have a ton of caramel, toffee, vanilla, smoke, very smooth oak, light pepper, super strong vanilla, leather and peacans. It's insanely complex and incredibly coherent. If I could give this beer a 6 I would. Taste wise, it has NO faults (enough for me to give a 5 on its own) and is absolutely spectacular in the mouth with its intensity of flavors while still being very drinkable. EDIT: Saw someone somewhere say this beer had creme brulee notes and I agree 100%. There is a definite lactose like creaminess in the flavors that are very much there.  M: This is quite heavy but not too much surprisingly. Very smooth, creamy and not sticky at all. Absolutely perfect for the genre.  O: Man I can't say enough about this beer. I haven't been this impressed by a beer in at least 7 years (it was Cantillon Saint-Lamvinus). It's very intense in flavors, it's extremely complex and still very coherent (high complexity beers sometimes have flavors that don't complement each others this well). It's easily my favorite beer of all time as it is one of my favorite genres and by far the best executed beer of the genre I have the pleasure to taste.   It was a very expensive beer at something like 35 USD, but it was well worth it to me. If I can find it again, I WILL buy at least 4 bottles. This beer commands your time and full attention. IMO, this is white whale worthy status.",0.6894553172594772,5.0,0.9968
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Kbbs '14  Pours a viscous, motor oil black color, with a small dark brown head, soon collapsing to a tiny ring of lacing with some spider web in the middle of the glass. Leaves back a mix of tiny tubbles and an oily texture after swirling.  Although I opened this after more than a year of its release, the coffee is as dominant as it has been in fresh Mornin' Delight. In this though, the Bourbon adds to the complexity of the coffee, creating an unforseen richness of aromas on the nose, while maple syrup appears to be a bit muted. There is a luscious bakers chocolate quality in this, tying the oaken barrel and flowery, cold pressed coffee beautifully together, creating a spicy coffee bean decadence, amped up by a mix of molasses and syrup. Coffee itself has an earthen note to it, perfectly enhanced by the barrel, while vanilla blends into scorched malts, producing an intense, wood accompanied, spicy praline impression.  I cannot belive the mouthfeel on this is real. This is unbelievable smooth. Rich and creamy, while featuring one of the most intense tasting beers I've ever had. Its silkness remains throughout, soothing the warmer parts of the beer with whipped cream and just an unbelievable softness.  Tastes of fudge, earth and brownie batter right from the beginning, together with a sweet and bitter cold pressed coffee appearance, adding foremost a roasty quality to the taste. While the flavors evolve rapidly on the palate, its silk creaminess calmes the upcoming flavor onslaught, leaving everything enjoyable and detectable. Milk chocolate and cocoa nibs set on top of the outstanding creaminess, finding their counterpart in roasty malts and a genuine coffee bitterness, blending into earth. Has a hot peak, together with a flowery barrel dryness, while licorice and a rich chocolate coating, calm the well accentuated, spicy heat. Finishes surprisingly clean and soft, right after the short, burning glimpse, whipped cream works its magic, ensuring the beers world class mouthfeel, while complimenting its chocolate richness. Coates the tongue during the aftertaste, together with gently spiced vanilla and coconut bark, packing also a lingering dryness.  This beer is beautiful throughout, it is indeed perfect. What I loved most about Mornin' Delight was its outstanding mouthfeel, but this one puts it to shame, by revealing a chewy smoothness, I have never experienced before in a beer. Its taste features a certain ambivalence, on the one hand it drinks fairly easy, due to its unreal silkness, while on the other hand it packs an unbelievable flavor range with a perfectly nuanced intensity to it. Everything seems to be in perfect balance, while maple syrup gets partially replaced by the far more complex Bourbon barrel in comparison to the MD. I understand this beer is highly sought after, this time it is most certainly well deserved.",0.7180599094287211,5.0,0.9967
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Canned 12/1/2016, it pours cloudy yellow gold with a foamy 1+ finger foamy white head that was packed with tiny bubbles, fading slowly and leaving really damn good foamy lacing that sticks to the glass.   Smells like pineapple juice; unbelievable how fruity and juicy this smells with so much citrus and fruit that the only way to describe it is fruit juice. Fantastic aroma to breath in, heavenly and all things hops.  Tastes so juicy that the citrus seems like citrus hop cones were squeezed to get the oil out and let the fruit juice flow. The fruit is abundant with green apple, pear, guava, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, lemon and every tropical fruit you could think of. The malt backbone gets the sweet caramel and syrupy toast going in synch with the hoppy goodness and just makes for a fantastically balanced IPA. Simply delicious.  Great feel and bitterness level, this was a fantastic beer overall.  3/18/2017-Had another can dated 03/09/17 and it validated how good this beer is...looks great again, the nose has tropical fruit, caramel, melon, pineapple, biscuit, fresh cut grass and tangerine. Lovely to inhale again, with zesty hops and a lot of dynamic fruity aromas to breath in...it really does start things off right when a beer smells this good. Once again the flavors are outstanding. Grapefruit juice, peach, lemon, pineapple, guava, brown sugar, fresh zesty piney hops, tropical fruit, star fruit, green apple, and just tons of fruit. Really tastes fresh hopped from the double dry hopping and just makes for an incredibly tasty beer. Enough malt backbone and caramel sweetness to bring it all together, this is a really great DIPA, perfectly balanced IPA and world class in my view.",0.6782480202533308,4.75,0.9967
Peche 'n Brett,"A big thanks to Jeff for this one. 750ml capped bottle into Tired Hands stemware. Shared with schen9303.   Pours a foamy 1.5 finger light cream colored head with great retention. Beer is a slightly cloudy orange. Lacing is thick and layered with excellent stick. An awesome looking beer.   Nose is fresh peaches and cream with hints of cane sugar. Very simple but the peach presence is one of the strongest I've ever come across.  Huge sweet peach flavor complemented by Brett funk, cane sugar, foam, coriander and floral notes. Lightly tart balanced by fruity sweetness throughout. Finishes peach skin and a slight woodiness. Really good.  Light bodied with ample carbonation. Prickly and lively in the mouth and goes down refreshing and crisp. Soft finish with a very clean aftertaste. Super drinkable.   A big thanks again to Jeff for this hyped and hard-to-come-by brew. Certainly worthy of praise, this is one of the more unique peach ""sours"" I've come across. Not so much tart but really uses the sweet peach character very nicely.",0.6954512427106656,4.25,0.9967
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"2008 vintage poured from a 750ml bottle into my Lost Abbey stemware. It poured a darker red color, much like an actual cherry. A thin, pink, bubbly head was there for the pour and then all but disappeared soon after.  The aroma is like a sour cherry pie. I get a pretty strong sour, tartness mixing with the fruity cherry flavors. A little bit of a funky, musty flavor is there and I get a little bit of vanilla as well. Great aroma overall, I love the fresh cherry flavor it had.  The taste shows a lot of tart and sourness to it. The cherries come out more in the finish along with a strong dry tartness. A little more funky, musty flavor is there in the finish as well.   The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style with carbonation being a little below average. Overall it was a great beer. I love cherries so I've been looking forward to trying this one for a while. The tart, sour cherries were really great in it. Pretty awesome beer to sip on this new Year's Eve.",0.6640707209587255,4.5,0.9967
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"2016 poured into a snifter on 1-1-17.  L - Very dark with mahogany edges. A finger of brown head that dissipates to a ring on the edge with decent amount of lacing.  S - Bourbon and oak, not a lot of sweetness. Drier than a lot of other BA stouts I've had initially but some caramel roast as it warms.   T - I get a lot of bourbon and black pepper. Gets a little sweeter as it approaches room temp. Surprisingly clean taste as flavors don't linger on the palate which is unexpected from something as heavy and slick. Lacks the usual roasty chocolate and coffee notes experienced with other BA stouts. Flavor is definitely not what I had expected. Not in a bad way, but different than other BA imp stouts. The bourbon/alcohol here is also different than I've experienced from other BA stouts. There's a certain astringency present that one would get from a neat bourbon. A lot of very subtle and mellow flavors going on. Interesting.  Side note: I'm getting a very intriguing, very slight and fleeting, taste of lavender. Could be attributed to the honey..? Maybe I'm just making it up.... who knows.   F - Beautiful mouth-feel. Not as thick as other imp stouts but it's not a bad thing here. SG and viscosity work perfectly with the carbonation. Pretty awesome, really.  O - Very interesting flavor profile. Really enjoyable as it's unexpectedly different from any BA stout I've had to date. Highly enjoyable, but hard to justify the price tag.",0.6797636163388873,4.5,0.9967
Beatification,"750 ml bottle sharred with 4 other BA's, I forgot who brought this but a huge thanks to whoever you are.  Batch 3  A- Really clear, golden straw color, nice carbonation coming off the bottom, no head, or lacing. S- Really nice aroma, sweet and sour at the same time, big fruity notes, lemon zest, sour apple, peach, awesome aroma, I cannot wait to try this. T- Wow amazing, very sour and puckering but sweet at the same time, apricot, peach, vinegar, sour apple, grape skin, lemon, absolutley delicious. M- Medium mouth feel, decent carbonation, fizzy, dry finish. O- Amazing beer, very impressed, love the acidity, vinegar, sour apple, easy drinkability, puckering, one of if not the best sour I have ever had.",0.6399415623323982,5.0,0.9967
Chocolate Rain,"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 2/16/2017. Pours hazy nearly opaque dark brown color with a 1 finger foamy light khaki head with very poor retention, that reduces to nothing very quickly. No lacing, some clinging alcohol legs, and streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, toffee, fudge, brownie batter, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, and brown bread; with light notes of coffee, roasted nuts, molasses, licorice, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, smoke, leather and yeast/roast/toast/oak earthiness. Increasing booze in the aromas as it warms, but not too overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malts, cocoa, vanilla, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, toffee, fudge, brownie batter, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, and brown bread; with light notes of coffee, roasted nuts, molasses, licorice, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, smoke, leather and yeast/oak earthiness. Light herbal/roast bitterness and bourbon/oak tannin spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, toffee, fudge, brownie batter, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, brown bread, coffee, roasted nuts, dark fruits, leather, and yeast/roast/toast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, cocoa, vanilla, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak/alcohol spiciness balance; with no cloying sweetness after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering and bourbon/oak/alcohol spiciness. Light-medium carbonation and very full body; with a very creamy/slick, and lightly syrupy/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is great. A bit rough on barrel tannins and spicy alcohol. Light-moderate increasing warmth of 19.6%, with mild lingering barrel booze after the finish. Overall this is an incredible barrel aged flavored imperial stout. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, cocoa, vanilla, and bourbon barrel flavors; pretty smooth and easy to sip on slowly for the massive ABV as it warms, with the mellowly bitter/tannic/drying finish. Fantastic balance of rich malts, vanilla, cocoa nibs, and bourbon barrel presence/integration. Not nearly as mind blowing as I remember from 2014 review. This is just ridiculously massive for a beer. A highly enjoyable offering otherwise, matches up with the rest of the Black Tuesday variants as expected.",0.6569056766589277,4.75,0.9967
Chocolate Rain,"In the Beer 2000 (the rest of this voice should sound like Conan O'brien)... Oh man, never thought I would reach 1000 let alone 2000, holy crap! To do it, one of my long (about 1 year) sought after beers, Chocolate Rain, ""Some stay dry and others feel the pain"" (Tay Zonday eat your heart out). Shared with rudzud as our shared RS membership dictates.  As it pours, it looks a bit lighter than I expected as it's flowing slowly out of the bottle. A light fizzy head forms, darker colored I think although hard to tell, fades almost instantly, although typical for ridiculous abv beer, over a very dark beer, not quite pitch black, with hints of light sneaking through the edges, and I mean HINTS. It also wants to have legs, but is more like a layered sleen of beer slowly sliding down the sides of the glass instead of legs.  Nose is just pure chocolate! Awesomeness! Tons of chocolate right out, oh and vanilla!. A big cocoa nib profile wafts out of the glass, not too aggressive at first, but then shows me up quickly, with some cocoa nibs, melted milk chocolate, a bit of baker's and some heavy dark chocolate. The fresh soaked vanilla beans, tons of caramel and molasses to add to the richness. A bit of booze, but doesn't seem like 19% yet. It brings that aroma of a brick of almost pure dark chocolate, there's so much chocolate! so many exclamation points!. A hint of cinnamon leads to some brandy and bourbon soaked raisin, vanilla, some oak and bourbon. The vanilla really builds as it warms.  Taste, ooohhh man, knee buckling, luckily I peed before I sipped this. it just erupts with pure chocolate! It reminds me a lot of the huge brick of the super dark chocolate I used to get at Trader Joe's which I would shave slices off, and let them just melt over my tongue, and the result is almost exactly like this experience. Various layers of chocolate melting all over my mouth, bakers', dark, milk, cocoa nibs, etc, etc, and also etc. Then comes vanilla, with all the descriptors I did for chocolate, vanilla is just behind it (well mostly after it warms). Some toasty oak barrel, vanilla, pure vanilla bean and richness. Some bourbon comes through as well, not strong, but enough to let you know, with a light bourbon soaked raisin like flavor. It drinks like 9% not 19%, smooth and rich, and just a light bitterness. A touch of biscuit adds some malted milk ball flavor. Finish is super long, mouth coating, tons of vanilla, chocolate, dark choc, light bourbon, oak, booze, and just a touch of bitterness, linger for what seems like forever, and even burps up flavor of awesomeness hours later.  Mouth... holy shit, this has to be the best mouth feel I've ever had in a beer!!! it doesn't even seem like a beer, more like velvet, velour, essence of pour silk, and everything in between, all having sex with the hottest chic in the world in heaven, wrapped in melted dark chocolate, and served on a naked hot Japanese woman, ala sushi, etc. There really isn't a word to describe the mouth feel. If I could vote for higher than 5, this mouth would go to 11. It even tickles my gums on each subsequent sip, literally tickles!  Overall... gggmmmsssshhhgggguguuuaaahhhgggrrrlllggguuh.",0.615047913318189,5.0,0.9966
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"375 ml bottle into snifter, 2017 vintage bottling. Pours opaque dark brown/black color with a 1 finger dense and rocky tan head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, walnuts, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, fudge, marshmallow, vanilla, cream, cinnamon, habanero pepper, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark/brown bread; with light notes of coconut, molasses, licorice, raisin, fig, date, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Touch of booze in the aromas as it warmed, but not overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, walnuts, spices, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, walnuts, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, fudge, marshmallow, vanilla, cream, cinnamon, habanero pepper, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark/brown bread; with light notes of coconut, molasses, licorice, raisin, fig, date, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Mild herbal/roast/char bitterness, and bourbon/oak/pepper/cinnamon spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, walnuts, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, fudge, marshmallow, vanilla, cream, cinnamon, habanero pepper, bourbon, toasted oak, dark/brown bread, light dark fruit/smoke/char, leather, tobacco, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, walnuts, spices, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet and spiciness balance; with no cloying/acrid/astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and bourbon/oak/spiciness. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety, and lightly sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is fantastic. Mildly increasing warmth of 12.1% and pepper heat; with minimal barrel booziness lingering after the finish. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged imperial spiced stout! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, walnuts, spices, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the big ABV, with the mildly bitter/spicy/drying finish. Amazingly rich malt complexity, perfectly balanced spices, and bourbon barrel presence/integration. Not overwhelming on any aspect. A bit more soft and mellowed out on spice after the barrel aging. A highly enjoyable offering as expected. Liked it just a bit more than the base beer.",0.6615194436723082,4.5,0.9966
Chocolate Rain,"just a ludicrous beverage here, i mean come on guys, this is taking it pretty far, and its truly epic. maybe the final evolution of the huge stout. i was amazed by this on so many levels, although i also have to say that doing anything to black tuesday seems a bit ridiculous, like improving on perfection is pretty tough right? and im definitely not sure this improves on it any at all, but it does create a whole new landscape, and a delicious one. the chocolate is really dominant, aptly named obviously, its a mix of sort of sweet milk chocolate and really bitter dark chocolate. for some reason it only tastes like the nibs a little bit, with a much stronger actual chocolate flavor than the bitter earthiness and espresso roast. must be all the sweetness going on, this is sweet because black tuesday is sweet, its sweet because the vanilla is sweet, and its sweet because the bourbon barrel here is very sweet. its all a good sugar, but its hard to ignore, and it slows down the rate of drinking just as quickly as the alcohol here, which is strong, but not quite as strong as i expected it to be given the insane strength. not as thick as the others for some reason, its viscous no doubt, but its just not quite as coating and filling. this is a very special rarity, and i am very grateful to have gotten to share it with close friends.",0.6503197055353709,4.5,0.9966
Beatification,"375 mL bottle poured into an RR -tion glass. Batch 5, bottled 1/10/2012. A celebration beer. Robotics National (International?) Champs.  Appearance - Pours a hazy golden-orange body. No much of a head. Small bit of white foam that settles to a ring of bubbles. Not really lively looking.  Smell - Nice tart fruit aromas. Citrus orange and lemon. Good dose of white peppery funk, but it's not anywhere near as strong as the best Belgian lambics.  Taste - First sip is tart, quite tart. Loads of lemon tang to it. Fades quickly, though. Wheat and hay permeate the flavor as it fades to a peppery funk in the end. Again, it's not moldy cheese funky or nasty sweaty feet sock funky, but it's a touch funky.  Mouthfeel - Finishes crisply and without a puckering sour flavor. It actually retains a bit of a sweetness. Just a hint. Lingering flavors are excellent. This is a well crafted beer. Finishes with just a touch of bitterness.  Overall - Really pleasant sour. Easily the best from RR and definitely one of the best American Wilds out there. Compared to a true Belgian lambic, though, it's not up with the best. Lacks a bit of complexity and definitely missing the funk that I crave. I'm being picky, though. This is delicious and a worthy celebration beer.",0.6843113967055023,5.0,0.9966
Black Tuesday,"If Stouts could inspire liqueur, then this beer is the epitome of that discussion. Again, The Bruery outdoes themselves with another transcendent ale. Beers simply don't get bigger, bolder, more confident or... more ideal!  Its highly viscous pour is the blackest of blacks- its onyx-like sheen makes the beer look every bit as much like an oil slick as it would anything meant to be placed in the mouth. Ominously dark, mysterious and undoubtedly masculine- there's simply something menacing about the beer's appearance. With really no foam, froth, or streaming to mention- the beer's espresso-like character takes hold.  As espresso is where the aromas take off. Deep sweet and smoky roast character is charged with the strongest roasted coffee that's woven together with molasses and maple syrups. Dark chocolate and dried fruit gives the beer a complex wine-like nose. Cherries, grapes, dates, figs and oak peak through the enormity of malt along with hints of coconut, vanilla and caramel as the beer warms.  Heading into taste, the stout's low-lying carbonation allows its massive malt sweetness to latch onto the taste buds and saturate them fully with high espresso roast, black-strap molasses, bittersweet chocolates, walnuts and a savory, smoky sweetness. Port wine and aged sherry release savory and almost salty flavors with a certain ""meatiness"" that reminds me playfully of teriyaki and soy sauce. Its that sweet and salty interplay that creates such a savory combination that the stout easily replaces dessert as after dinner reward. Its molasses-infused bourbon flavor is well equipped with oak, vanilla, coconut and char as the beer warms.  Incredibly rich and chewy, the beer's viscosity wraps around the tongue like a ribbon of silk- it might as well make love to the mouth. Its heavy coat easily penetrates to soft tissues of the mouth and is slow to release- allowing for a forever linger of sweetness, booze and brownie.  With all the Imperial Stouts on the market, few reach this kind of apex- its every much a digestive liqueur that's as well balanced, complete and robust as any. If stout is the questions, then Black Tuesday wins!",0.6888295782238409,4.75,0.9966
Scaled Up,"Canned 10/4/16. Consumed 10/10/16.  A: Beer comes in a medium gold color with medium-plus haze. About a finger of fluffy white head forms as it pours, bit it dissipates rapidly and fades to a thin ring of tiny bubbles within a minute. Not too much lacing on the glass.  S: Intensely aromatic. A true medley of tropical fruit, with pineapple, mango, blueberry, and peach at the forefront. There's a musty, overripe, almost rotten fruit character as well as an underlying dusty, earthy white grape note from the Nelson. I'd say that the Galaxy and Mosaic definitely dominate the aroma while the Nelson plays a very nice supporting role.   T: Follows the nose, but with a few additional and potent notes. I get a lot more citrus (sweet orange, grapefruit) up front; in fact, the citrus is actually the dominant flavor throughout the taste. Tropical fruits are still there, but much more restrained. Pineapple, mango, blueberry for sure. On the backend, that Nelson-y grape flavor really comes out, but it's a sweeter grape flavor than I'm used to from Nelson. The finish isn't nearly as dry as other Nelson-hopped beers I've had recently. The sweetness of the fruit flavors really carries through and makes for an incredibly balanced and satisfying aftertaste.  M: Medium-plus weight on the tongue with a really nice balance of bitterness and sweetness. There's a lingering sticky, almost candied dried fruit sweetness that coats the mouth, but the medium bitterness and white-wine-esque dryness keeps it far from being cloying. It's incredibly smooth for the ABV with a very textured (slightly chalky) yet still quite juicy feel. Not quite creamy, but very close.  O: This is a really good DIPA and an excellent showcase of three of my favorite hops. The aroma on this is HUGE, one of the most pungent and explosive that I've experienced in a while. The aromatic profile is rich and tropical with an perfect earthiness to complement the sweet, almost candied fruit notes. The flavor follows suit, but is less diverse and more heavily citric. As the beer warmed, I got a bit more alcohol on the taste and a slightly 'fusel' nail polish-y flavor, which was a bit unpleasant. It wasn't overpowering at all, but I definitely preferred this when it was cold vs. near cellar temp. Overall, this is a fantastic DIPA and one of my favorite Trillium beers yet.",0.713753115154619,4.5,0.9966
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2008 sticker. Cork comes out with a very satisfying pop. Says bottled in 2010.  Pours a gorgeous, deep reddish pink, with a light pink head. Pours about 2 fingers of head, but it reduces almost immediately, leaving pretty much nothing but the most delicious looking raspberry juice you've ever seen. Lack of visible carbonation beyond the occasional bubble is a bit disappointing, though.  Smell is pretty strong on raspberries upfront. Some earthy funk and sourness comes through too. A bit of oak. This is really nice, good meld of smells, but the raspberry definitely takes center stage.  Oh yeah, that's pretty sour. Not as strong on the raspberry as I was hoping or expecting from the smell. There's some raspberry, some oak, some earthy mustiness. The oak is more prominent than in the nose. Very funky. Not quite as nice as the smell, but it's still very tasty. Maybe a bit of citrus and underripe green apple in there too. More like a 4.25, but I'm feeling generous.  Despite the appearance to the contrary, the mouthfeel is actually really nice. Decent carb, not overwhelming, and a slightly thin body, which seems perfect to me. Very slight creaminess, and a smooth finish.  I'm new to Cantillon, and to sours in general, but I've yet to find a loon I didn't enjoy. Another hit.",0.6787609238393746,4.5,0.9966
Swish,"16 oz can poured into a bulbed pint glass. Liquid comes out a nice golden yellow color. Glows a little brighter when it's held up to the light. Nice white colored head, mostly small bubbles and it has some decentnlacing to it.   Smell is really good, jumps out at you right out of the can. Huge tropical hop aromas immediately. Orange, mango, and pinnacle kind of come out immediately then there's some floral and resin notes. Some nice light bready grain notes at the end.  Taste is really, really good. Delicious flavors of orange, like baked orange bread or pound cake though. Pinnaple and mango and some fresh juicy tangerine, some tropical flavors with a little bit of citrus peel. Some nice light gentle grains in there as well.  Mouthfeel is good. Has a nice heavy medium feel with somewhat of a lingering flavor. Very nice carbonation level, works great with the beer. It's well balanced; sweet without being to sweet and hoppy without being a total hop bomb. Great drinkability and an easy beer to drink. A beer for anyone to enjoy year round. Glad to have been able to try it. Thanks Nick for hooking me up with a couple cans!",0.680440358278707,4.5,0.9965
Haze,"Traded for this beer a little while back and wanted to have a full can of this after taking a sip of this in the Other Half line. Can dated 4/20 (ha!) with ""Alright X 3"" written below it as this still tasted fresh when I finally gave it a go today. No floaties as the haze was still present but not overpowering, indicating that there wasn't any massive sediment in this. Even though the Julius was more popular and the first beer that I had from Tree House, I liked this more as it wasn't as potent and was much more balanced, making it easier to sip without being hit over the head by juice and hops!  Lovely pour to this as the beer had the aforementioned hazy shine to it, with a muted golden hue, massive head, and tons of soapy lacing left on my pint glass. Mostly orange on the nose, to go along with the yeast, some booze, and candied tangerine sweetness. All of those were in the taste, which had to be one of the most appealing and pleasing that I've ever had in a beer. The spice from the grapefruit kicked in pretty quickly, followed by a good piney mouthfeel, dank weed, a bit of garlic, and lots of tropical fruits. Slick, moderate in carbonation, and wonderfully balance, the earthy hops were a nice base to the wide range of flavors on top that meshed wonderfully together.   Plenty of booze here but with so much to enjoy here, who's to notice? There was just the right amount of juice and sweetness here and I didn't need a glass of water to chase this down with. Beers like this come around once in a blue moon and I can't wait to get my hands on this again. With everything in near-perfect proportion, what's not to love?",0.6719354874674637,4.5,0.9965
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"For the most part, I've been disappointed with aged framboises. This is the 2007 vintage, bottled 14 Sept 2009, consumed 29 April 2011 in celebration of our last night living in DC (for now, at least) and having those French bastards rip us off $10K for a POS UHV tee they made for us.  Decanted, this is clear with a dense, light pink head with excellent retention and lacing, this is a great looking lambic. The nose has a beautiful, bright, raspberry character, fruity and jammy with macerated fruit. The lambic base is expressed as a more lemony, ripe character, in line with Cantillon's Lou Pepe line. A little grass and hay are present as well.  The palate opens with quite an intense sourness, very lemony, very lemon-rind like with a distinct raspberry fruitiness, moderately jammy but also very bright, ripe and almost floral. Demonstrating the dichotomy that is a fruit lambic - ripe, delicate, fruit character coupled with an intensely sour base. There's a definite musty character, one that's lightened up by the lemony sourness. Drying, sour and lemony acidity are present on the finish, along with a rather prominent fruit character. Despite being relatively young, this does has a touch of solventy, rotting raspberry character present. Seedy tannins are present, lending a mild nuttiness to the flavor, especially the finish. Despite the high acidity, I seem to have no problem plowing through the first half of the bottle and savoring the second.  Ultimately, this is the completely unlike Hommage in that it leans more heavily on the sourness rather than the fruit. Additionally, this just doesn't seem to age as well as the Drie Fonteinen framboises seem to (I only have Hommage as a reference, but I hear Framboos is rather amazing even 12 years on).  **Original review :03-08-2009 08:36:11** 4/4/4.5/4.5/4.5 2003 vintage picked up at Sam's in Clybourn today. At $30 a bottle, I wasn't going to pay up another $15 to carry it back home. Into a wine glass  A: Hazy pink with a thin white head that recedes fairly quickly. This would be clear (it was when I picked it up) but it doesn't take well to a train ride in a backpack  S: Opens up with a ton of funk - wet leather, horse blanket - before a mild raspberry note comes through. Fruit character is well expressed, with the aroma carrying through very well. Age might have something to do with the shift in balance towards a more funk-forward beer. Acidity is noticeable  T: Opens up sour and tart with plenty of acidity. Funk is restrained compared to the sourness - very forward and bracing. Acidity is prominent, lemony in nature. Fruit comes through in the middle, with a delicate raspberry flavor that works very well, now that my palate has been opened up by the sourness. Finishes dry, tart and long  M: Soft carbonation, light body and a delicious finish. Great stuff  D: A 750 is going to be no problem. OTOH, I think I'm going to drink my fruit lambics fresh and age my gueuzes.  **Edit 26 March 2011** Joe was kind enough to share a bottle of the 2002 vintage (bottled in 2004). Light, this is a clear amber and is lightly carbonated. The nose has rotting, overripe raspberries and nail polish remover. Not much funk, there's some pie-like cooked fruit character, mildly jammy. The palate opens super sour, definitely too much so. Not really acetic or lactic, is this what an excess of malic acid tastes like, but it is unpleasant. Light in carbonation, this is too sour in my book. 3.5/3/2.5/3/2.5",0.6919658119096911,4.5,0.9965
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Canned 9/27/16. Consumed 10/6/16.  A: Beer comes in a medium-plus hazy light orange with about a finger of pillowy white head that sticks around for a while. Thick rings of lacing stick to the glass, and alcohol legs are apparent.  S: Trillium's notes are spot on. Huge notes of lime, grapefruit juice, and orange peel. Subtle hints of earth, wood, and musty dankness, but the zesty, pithy, citrus notes are dominant, almost overwhelming.  T: Again, Trillium describes their own beer perfectly. Very floral up front with notes of grapefruit and navel orange. Light bready sweetness hits mid-mouth and transitions to a sweet, almost candied citrus on the finish. Here, I get grapefruit and a reappearance of that huge lime note I picked up on the nose. Lingering sweet grapefruit/lime flavor sticks to the palate.  M: Medium weight on the palate with a great balance of sweetness and bitterness. Lingering aftertaste is accompanied by medium sweetness and medium bitterness to pleasantly sit on the tongue long after the swallow. It's not quite creamy, but the carbonation is smooth enough to make for a very drinkable beer, despite the intensity of flavor it packs.  O: As with all the DDH versions of the Street series beers, this is an excellent showcase of El Dorado. It packs a TON of flavor and aroma into a beer around 7% while offering a simple, clean malt bill that balances out the intense dry-hopping without much distraction. As with all beers in this series, overall opinion basically hinges on affinity for the highlighted hop. For me, El Dorado is a very enjoyable hop, but one that I prefer to be used in conjunction with others. The pungent notes of lime, grapefruit and earthy flowers are not my favorite, but they're still quite good. It's a very well executed IPA that I'd happily enjoy again!",0.7054023379032677,4.5,0.9965
Oude Geuze Vintage,"bottle poured into a tasting glass. 2002 Red label. Big thanks to the generosity of Adam for sharing this with us!  (A)- Pours a hazy goldenrod color that produced a good white head that dissipated quickly, but settled in on a nice layer for awhile.   (S)- Very dry with mild must and plenty of lemon peel. Some hay funk and earth, but actually rather clean if that makes sense.   (T)- Great tart sourness with hay earth funk. Nice fruity tang. Super dry on the finish. Ever so slightly lactic.  (M)- A great carbonation level and balance. Clean, crisp and inviting. Sour, but held back a bit. Super dry, but I like.  (D)- A great gueuze for sure. Dry and tart with nice fruit character. Makes me look forward to trying the regular non-vintage aged with a decade or more on it.",0.6871679562055226,4.5,0.9964
Black Tuesday,"ng Type: Bottle (dated 8.25.15) Consumed: 12.4.15  A: 4.25 Pours a very dark brown with a small, light tan head that dissipates quickly. Looks a bit thinner than expected.  S: 4.5 Immediately struck with caramel, raisins, chocolate, vanilla, and quite a bit of bourbon. There are some roasted malt and coffee aromas going on, but they are definitely dominated by the sweeter elements.  T: 4.75 As expected, this is a sweet beer. Still, it’s surprisingly balanced walking the line between strong ale and stout. Like the nose, the flavor has plenty of raisin, caramel, vanilla, and oak. There’s also tons of maple and molasses on the palate too, blending into relatively subtle roasted malt, licorice, and berry character and making the whole experience more interesting. The beer is just slightly dry and bitter on the finish.  M: 4.5 I had the 2014 version prior and felt it was a bit thin. 2015 is much more substantial, almost chewy; it’s still not to BCBS or parabola levels of thickness, but that might help this beer overall. The carbonation is great and the finish almost makes this huge beer feel drinkable.   O: 4.5 This is a fantastic beer with tons of interesting flavors and aromas. It’s also very impressive how drinkable it is considering it’s nearly 20%. Not exactly the prototype of a BA stout, but definitely a great example of what bourbon barrels can do to strong beers.",0.6958492236502648,4.5,0.9964
Aaron,"Got this one from dboon in a recent box. Cheers for all the loot man!   From a 500ml bottle into a snifter Released April 2014 Barleywine style ale aged in oak barrels  APPEARANCE: Pours out a syrupy mahogany brown/red and yields a small, medium looking, slightly foamy, light tan head with decent retention. Head slowly recedes to a half wisp and ring. Hazy mahogany or ruby red in color with no carbonation evident. A splotchy wisp remains all the way but leave no real lacing down the glass. Good looking barleywine.   SMELL: Big nose of oak, bourbon, red fruits, toffee, leather and hints of vanilla from the barrels. Bold stuff. Very fruity with plenty of barrel character.   TASTE: Oak notes, toffee and red fruit flavors up front. Enough alcohol as well and plenty flavorful initially. Lots of red fruit before more wood and alcohol show up at the swallow. A bold and boozy finish of oak, bourbon, toffee, vanilla sweetness, leather, plenty of red fruits and caramel sweetness lingers on the palate. Sweet, boozy, with plenty of barrel character.   PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Creamy enough on the palate for the style, goes down fine with a decent burn at the swallow and finishes rather sticky. Lots of heat lingers but it's fitting.  OVERALL: This is solid stuff, and well worth tracking down if you're a fan of the style. Really flavorful barleywine with plenty of red fruit and barrel character working really well together. The sweet malt flavor is really enjoyable as well. It’s a little hot and harsh at the swallow perhaps, and unfortunately there’s no reasonable way to find out what the ABV is on this one, so we can’t say whether that’s to be expected here or not. Still, even without knowing that, I’d gladly drink this again and am happy to have had the chance to try it out. It will most likely age very nicely too, but I’m not one to hunt beers to not drink them. If you get a chance to try this, don’t hesitate. Thanks again for the brews dboon. This was delicious.",0.6713921359394045,4.5,0.9964
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"GLASS: Snifter TEMP: approx 45 - 50 degrees VINTAGE 2009 (Had @ DLD)  Much like Dark Lord, this one is solid black. It has a small head of tan foam that dissipates to a ring aound the edge of the surface. Lacing is a touch better than the 'regular' version, but still not very much. It's still very thick and viscous, sliding down the sides of the glass.  This is where it steps out away from it's brother. Nice big oakiness joins the chocolate and coffee notes. Dark fruits are still present, just a little more subdued. Wonderful bourbon-like notes. The vanilla is brought a little more forward. Nice caramel toffee notes.  Taste follows the 'regular' version, as well. This one brings along nice notes of charred oak, vanilla and bourbon. Molasses comes forward a touch. Lots of brown sugar notes. Slight hint of tobacco. The oak aging really mellows the flavor profile out, making this one not nearly as sweet as the 'regular' version and giving it a drier finish.  While this one is still full-bodied and creamy and yes, thick, it loses just a touch, comparatively. If I weren't comparing it to it's brother it would score perfect anyway, but this one is slightly less, in that sense. In the 'regular' DL review, I said it deserved to be rated with a 7 for mouthfeel. This one still deserves a 6.  While this beer is incredible and totally worth the wait to get the chance to try it, I think that I actually prefer the 'regular' DL just slightly better. That shocks me, because I love barrel-aged brews, in general. I just like the big, bold, malty sweetness in the other one, which is toned down in this one. Also, the booziness is more prominent in this one, which is not a bad thing, but it's better when you don't know that it's there.",0.6477288608249779,4.5,0.9964
Peche 'n Brett,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 1/2019. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger dense and rocky white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big juicy and lightly tart peach, apricot, pineapple, lemon zest, white grape, pear, green apple, white pepper, honey, bread, hay, straw, grass, light musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome balance and complexity of fruity/spicy/funky yeast, peaches, and pale malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of lightly tart peach, apricot, pineapple, lemon zest, white grape, pear, green apple, white pepper, honey, bread, hay, straw, grass, light musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of yeast spiciness and slight tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of peach, apricot, pineapple, lemon zest, white grape, pear, green apple, white pepper, honey, hay, straw, light funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of fruity/spicy/funky yeast, peaches, and pale malt sweetness; with a great malt/yeast spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly slick/prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome fruited brett saison. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy/funky yeast, peaches, and pale malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.",0.6875455730279062,4.5,0.9964
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"bourbon barrel aged imperial stout with coffee, which on paper sounds like the same thing a million other breweries are doing, but in reality, is unique as can be, more concentrated and intense in all aspects than almost anything else in this field i have had before, which is a large sample size for sure. the coffee here is so fresh, earthy, and rich. its roasted like crazy, with an obvious dark chocolate profile that blends in beautifully with all the dark malts, which in this case stand out more than in a lot of these due to the apparent lack of a sweet malty middle, its all dry and roasty, near black, with the only sweetness at all in here coming from the bourbon, which has honey and vanilla and toasted marshmallow aspects to its sweetness, but its not from grain. it almost tastes like an ice beer, like some of the water was frozen out to make the beer thicker and more pronounced in the flavors, the dark malt here is really deep, and the coffee is dosed heavily enough to match it all the way through. there is a lot of charred oak on this, a faint hint of coconut and raisin right up front, and lots more chocolate. the whiskey is pretty strong here too, but it brings the coffee together with the wood and the heft of the grain. rich vanilla and maple notes in it, and just a little warming alcohol. this is amazingly complex and delicious, a hell of a breakfast beer, and another reason why i am increasingly obsessed with this brewery! this is one of the best of its kind!",0.6905277779854294,4.5,0.9964
Mastermind,"Canned 8/7/2015, bought the next day at the brewery. Props to Fiddlehead for a very efficient system. We drove by to see 300+ people in line, and gave up, only to return an hour later. The line had dissipated completely, but still, anyone who wanted a case got one. Super quick and I actually felt like these guys were happy that people were getting to try their beer, unlike some of the bigger names in the area.   Poured into a tulip from a 12oz can - I understand this to be the first batch with the new colored (plastic) labels.   L: Beautiful golden-amber color in front of a light. No visible sediment at all, but rather opaque. I prefer clear beer but this looks apetizing.   S: Big, sweet citrus and melon. Very clean and not as in-your-face as something like Sip of Sunshine.   T: Utterly ridiculous. Right off the bat this is one of the most balanced beers I've ever tasted. Grassy turns to melon, then suddenly a long tangerine-like citrus finish. I adore fruit bombs and this one is perfect. Nothing else hiding in the flavor, just a nice logarithmic curve up to the fruity finish. Unreal.   F: Almost a little thin up front for the style - but it's so brief I can't even be sure. As the flavor comes on, so does the mouthfeel. Perfectly fills the palate, but doesn't give me sweater teeth like Heady and some other over-the-top resin jobs.   O: I don't even know what to say. I love everything about this beer, from buying it on premises to the last drop. I would make the 6 hour drive back to Shelburne just for this. Given the choice, I wouldn't take Heady Topper or SoS over Mastermind. Okay, I've calmed down a little. Now I just have to figure out how to make it back for more.",0.6517590501403587,4.75,0.9964
Beatification,"HUGE thank you to Aaron for surprising me with this gem. shared with mike and scott in an evening of exciting sours.  batch 004  a - poured a murky fuzzy orangey yellow with a thin fizzy head. the bottle was a gusher.  s - black pepper funk. sweet tarts. like a russian river sour on funk steroids.  t - WHOA that's a funky sour! sour grapefruit. like the juice they used to give me in day camp when i needed something thirst quenching, yet instead ended up having dried out puckered mouth. the oak is in there, but under the sour flavoring. smarties and sweet tarts.  m - PUCKERING - super sour.  o - extremely sour. not for the faint of heart. nearly knocked me down at first. all that being said, it didn't seem much different than the standard russian river sours, which in my opinion are just as good as this. this is definitely on the overly sour side.  *** ** * ** *** edit 2012-08-15 Batch 3 (750) *** ** * ** *** 4 - 4.5 - 4.5 - 4 - 4 Notes from a tasting on 8/15. big thanks to totoropanda for bringing this one.  appearance was just like the other batches i've tried, a murky orange. smell was super sour and tart in the nose with some floral kicks to it. taste was also extremely sour and sweet tart with some floral notes. the beer has a really nice feel to it. not prickly but close to it. this is a really solid beer, very balanced and extremely drinkable for such a sour beer. i found that i liked this batch better than batch 4, but not as much as batch 5.",0.6402505332696181,4.0,0.9964
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Recently shared at sour day by rvdoorn and papaeugene. Thanks again for a wonderful day guys!   From a 75cl bottle into a wine glass.  Bottled 13 April 2002  APPEARANCE: Pours a big, fluffy, white head with good retention. Gamboge orange in color, hazy, with medium levels of carbonation. A ring remains until the end but leaves no lacing down the glass.   SMELL: Funky and acidic with tart lemon citrus notes, green apples, barnyard, hay, as well as some leather on the nose. Very nice.   TASTE: Funky, moldy, with lots of tart, lemon citrus flavors and sour green apples up front. Lots of smoky leather as well, with a good dose of acidic sourness and tart citrus fruits lingering on the palate. Soft and very well balanced, with lots of funk and slightly acidic sourness.   PALATE: Lighter body with higher levels of carbonation. Airy and bubbly on the palate, goes down okay and and finishes puckering. It calms and becomes creamier as it sits, turning into a smooth treat after a while.   OVERALL: This is really fantastic stuff. The feel needs a few minutes to calm a bit, but the overall quality of this aged gueuze is excellent. Well meshed and balanced flavors highlighting both the funky and acidic sourness sides of the style. A real treat and I'm happy to have had the chance to try this first vintage. Thanks again guys!

Enjoy By IPA,"(Enjoy by 4.20.17, purchased on 4/20 and chilled, consumed 4/21... poured into a tulip)  L: pale amber-gold liquid, mostly clear but with maybe a very slight haze... rocky, jiggly blanket of bright off-white foam, nice hold... a few jagged scars of crusty lace  S: orange pulp, sweet pepper, grapefruit oil... very soft, medicinal booze underneath, as well as some biscuity malt... maybe more than a hint of peach and a subtle overtone of old wool upholstery... nice little nuances, but intensity may have softened by the point  T: super citrusy up front, with a surprising degree of lightly toasty-roasty crystal malt poking out... spicy, peppery static in the middle of the palate... the malt stays nicely balanced with the bitter citrus of the hops in the aftertaste, but that could be due to the hop dynamics having softened by the final day... malt and spice goes almost snickerdoodle last two sips, mmm... bold flavors overall, though lacking any unique (hop) characteristics  F: at first, medium-light bodied and supple... softly oily residue with a lovely full-thorax warmth... excellent tongue squeezing bitterness long after each sip... the alcohol behaves itself - such expert execution... by the end, it's malt/hop nectar (filtered hermetically clean, however)... the balance is superb - maybe you could lay this down for awhile  O: the hop flavors are very conventionally west coast, but their depth, density, and intensity is fantastic... this might easily be their most flavorful, enjoyable hoppy pale (when young)... great marketing concept (drink by), though the 10-hop garbage still never does amount to anything interesting",0.721279926500545,4.5,0.9964
Black Tuesday,"2012 bottle, shared with friends and family at the Local Option's Pi Day event. Poured into a snifter, reviewed from notes.  Pours a sludgey cola brown color, almost jet black but lots of brown hues are visible when struck by the light. A few tiny bubbles appear momentarily but are gone immediately and no lacing is left behind. The aroma is powerfully sweet, lots of chocolate, bourbon, sweet oak, mollasses, vanilla, brown sugar and even some toasted marshmallow at the end. There is a powerful alcohol presence that lingers and almost burns the nose, not to be unexpected at nearly 20%, but still a bit of a deterrent. The flavors are really intense, lots of bourbon and sweet milk chocolate, brown sugar, a bit of bitter roast and molasses, chewy oak is a nice touch with some vanilla behind it but the alcohol really dominates the back end of this and the finish is fairly hot. The body is nice, chewy at times, silky at others, it coats the mouth well, nearly zero carbonation but just enough to keep it lively and interesting and there is a nice warming sensation as it goes down.  Verdict: Despite this beer being nearly 20% and fairly hot, it's very drinkable which is quite impressive, but I'm not blown away by this. I've been fortunate enough to try a variety of vintages of this and even with time it's still a alcohol forward beer which isn't really my preference. A worthy beer for anyone who enjoys a barrel aged stout, but there are plenty of better ones on the market, and many of them for a better price.",0.6623333699432001,4.0,0.9964
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"750 ml capped and corked bottle poured into several glasses. 2008 vintage. Huge thanks go to Stakem for generously sharing this.  Pours a lovely looking ruby, topped with a ½ finger of pinkish colored foamy head. This retains well, leaving back a rich and frothy cascade of lacing which rides high up the sides of the glass. The aroma smells of ripe raspberries, funk, acidity, and a touch of wood. Those juicy raspberries really pop here but the funkiness of this definitely has its place as well.   The raspberries are right out there in the taste as well but the overall flavor does get a bit intense from the funk and sourness that is present. It definitely weaves in and out of being acidic but then much more along the lines of a fruity tartness as well. This luckily doesn’t get out of hand, as there is just enough of a very light sugary presence here to helps cut things a bit. There is a little more stand out funk here than what I’m used to with this brewery, which stretches into the finish along with some dry edges. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and spritely feeling in the mouth, with a crisp feel that jumps those flavors around in the mouth and helps with keeping things staying interesting.   This was nice. It had a bit more of a Lambic funkiness to it than I expected but that fresh raspberry flavor and a lively body really kept this energetic feeling in the taste and feel despite the assertiveness of the flavors at times. This is another Cantillon well worth checking out.",0.6972534468502718,4.0,0.9964
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Got to have a small glass of this at Dark Lord Day 2010. The pour was pitch black with some dark chocolate lacing clinging to the sides of the glass. It's one of the darkest and thickest looking stouts I think I've ever seen. It left a little lacing on the glass but not a lot.  The aroma had a big vanilla and oak wood presence with a good amount of bourbony alcohol flavor to it as well. It also had dark chocolate, roasted malts and a little dark fruit to it. The barrel added a very nice complex aroma to it, it was a little strong but didn't overwhelm the beer.  The taste also has a large oak, vanilla and bourbon presence to it. The bourbon flavor gave it a warming alcohol finish. Also present were some dark roasted and chocolate flavors but they definitely took a backseat to the barrel flavors.  The mouthfeel was nice and thick with low carbonation. Very nice mouthfeel on it considering I like thick and heavy stouts. Drinkability was decent although the alcohol and barrel characteristics were a little strong. The 4-5 oz glass that I got was plenty for me.  Overall a very nice modification of Dark Lord. I enjoyed the glass I had but probably wouldn't have gotten another one, especially if this was a beer available all the time. It felt like the barrel characteristics were a little overpowering and became the main flavor of the beer instead of Dark Lord being the main flavor with some barrel characteristics to enhance the complexity. Don't get me wrong it was delicious and great for the serving size they gave out, just couldn't justify any higher scores for it based on that.",0.6822100876717316,4.0,0.9963
Second Fiddle,"Pint can (3/22/18) ""Your cat died"" on bottom.poured into a long stem Treehouse glass.  A wildflower honey color, clear and bright. The off-white foam cap is rocky and bubbly, excellent retention with plenty of thin covering. Intricate and sticky lacing leftover's.  The hoppy aromatics are powerful! A pungent bouquet of dense and fresh smelling hops, very juicy, sweet tropicals, like strawberry and pineapple. Wet grass, dried leaves and multiple layers of fruits. Some slight peppery and boozy notes with a caramel like sweetness in the malt. This is easily one of the best smelling and aromatic Dipa's I've had the pleasure of sniffing.   The multiple dry hopping sessions sure give it an excellentl dry and crispy bite. The malt is very light and crisp with layers of dryness, earthiness and a peppery kick right at the end. A light to medium juicy body and texture surrounded by dryness. Light to medium bodied, juicy then dry texture finishing dry but very clean. Awesome feel!   The hop complexity in the flavor is straight magic. Dry-earthy, juicy-fruity, green veggies and crispy summertime leaves, black pepper bite and bitter-dry hop pellet, straight...no chaser! The leftover taste, the lingering green-grassy, fresh hop taste is crazy good. Deep hop complexity with a wide range of hoppy effects. The dry-earthy and fresh hop cone taste I love so much, grassy, earthy, fruity, bitter, juicy....I mean, it's all here!! The malt is light, grainy tones of dried wheat and slight caramel sweetness. Not a golden, pilsner style thing like many New England style's but a light and bright amber malt is more like it. Excellent balance in a fine supporting role to the mega-star hops. The depth and complexity of the hop flavor and overall affect is rather mind-blowing.   This monster Dipa plays NO ""second"" fiddle to anyone !",0.7273919037361779,4.75,0.9963
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Pours black and thick almost like used motor oil with a short light brown head. It's as beautiful as any stout I've seen.  Smells sweet and boozy of course, but it also has plenty of exotic coffee aroma. I don't know much about coffee but for me this is smelling like walking down the coffee aisle at a fancy grocery store. I love that smell, although I'm not much of a coffee fan.  Tastes like it smells pretty much. The bourbon doesn't add a lot initially, I found it more in the lingering after taste, although it certainly feels boozy. It tastes especially creamy, Jackie O's knows how I like my coffee. There is just the right amount of coffee bitterness, too. Some chocolate coming along for the ride, too.  Feels pretty heavy and boozy, which is what I look for in my BA stouts, but it still manages to be very easy to drink. The bourbon is also a little noticeable in the lingering taste and warmth in my mouth and throat. Very relaxing.   Overall, this is the best barrel aged coffee stout and the best Jackie O's offering I've ever had. Easiest five stars I've ever given.",0.6157151800336581,5.0,0.9963
Haze,"this one is cool because the hop complexion is a little more familiar and old school. its northwestern and spicy and vegetal and piney to me, intense, like a west coast ipa that just also happens to be multigrain and hazy. this one has become famous for them, and i can certainly see why, it should appeal to ipa drinkers of all persuasions, oily and bitter too to an extent that the others i have had from them recently are not. i like this being a little more classically styled in terms of hop flavors, it allows me to easily appreciate what the grain base does for the hops, which is to extend them well beyond just the finish, and to almost balance their intensity with texture not with flavor, which is amazing, this is super soft and round and bubbly and exciting, unique feel for hoppy beer, and these guys have it dialed. grapefruit and orange zest in the nose, fresh pine, resinous and almost concentrated, intense in a delicious way. its not overly complex, but thats part of what makes it, the simplicity is great. its clean and pure and fresh, and while i might not rank it among the best hoppy beer in the world like so many folks here on BA have, i sure enjoyed the can and hope to be able to drink a bit more of this in the future. lucky to have had a friend send me these cans, i really enjoyed all of the tree house ive had recently, and totally see what all the hype is about!",0.6908144198197554,4.25,0.9963
Nelson,"Poured a cloudy golden body with one finger of bubbly white head. Overall impression of appearance is of an excellent IPA, very true to style. Scents of tropical fruit, especially tart passion fruit, a vinous dry white wine character, hints of mango and underlying notes of tart citrus with hints of lemon most noticeable alongside light tangerine and light vegetal hop notes and spicy rye malt. Overall impression of aroma is of a very nice rye IPA that showcases the best of the Nelson Sauvin hops along with the character of the rye. Bright and fruity describes it best. Flavor begins hoppy with notes passion fruit, oniony, vegetal hops, dry white wine, slight citrus peel and some spicy rye malt backbone. Middle continues vegetal flavors with passion fruit fading into the background, spicy rye and spicy hop flavors providing depth, lightly floral flavors and moderate notes of citrus peel. Finish is hoppy and dry with notes of vegetal hops, grapefruit peel, spicy hops and spicy rye malt and some light tangerine. Aftertaste is vegetal hops, grapefruit peel, spicy rye malt and light pine resin. Overall impression of flavor is of an excellent Nelson Sauvin hopled rye IPA, bringing forth the best aspects of both flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a sticky, resinous feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of an excellent IPA, true to form. Overall this is an amazing IPA. It uses two of my favorite ingredients, rye and Nelson Sauvin hops to create a complex and rich IPA.",0.7096647859882372,4.75,0.9963
Madagascar,"650ml bottle from the recent 2014 release. Much thanks to Dylan for sending this one. Served in a snifter 2/13/2015.  A- Dark brown body, opaque and close to being pitch black. One finger offwhite head, nice retention, no lacing.  S- Vanilla ice cream. Seriously, this smells like authentic vanilla with a nice dose of bourbon and lactose. Some milk chocolate sweetness, a small bit of oak. Sweet smelling enough but not over the top. This is perfectly beyond what I expected it to be, and I knew its reputation going into this. Wow, the vanilla balance in this is perfect. Surprised there wasn't more barrel in this, but honestly, I really don't care- it adds more vanilla to the overall flavour than anything else.  F- Vanilla ice cream flavour, milk chocolate, a bit of roasted malt, slight espresso, slight smoky bourbon flavour. This is phenomenal and drinking better then BCBVR is right now. Perfect amount of vanilla that is genuine and not extract-like at all.  M- Medium bodied, nice silkiness and moderately creamy; does not reach the mouthfeel of BCBVR but not a lot of beers do, anyway. Drinks great, easy to drink and zero heat.  O- This beer is drinking better than BCBVR is right now, and reminds me a lot of aged BCBVS. It hits that sweet spot of perfect vanilla goodness without being boozy at all. Seek this one with prejudice!",0.6638188556359219,4.5,0.9963
Oude Geuze Vintage,"750ml bottle 6,0% Abv. Served lightly chilled in an over sized wine glass.  Bottled on: 27/12/2007 BB: 27/12/2017  This is the 4th beer in my series of sours.   Appearance: Beautiful gueuze! Bright golden-orange body (a little darker than other gueuzes I have had recently) topped by a large white head that lasts really well and leaves some patchy lace. Subsequent pours cause the beer to become significantly cloudier and deeper orange in colour.   Smell: I was expecting a good nose on this one, but damn this smells delicious! Beautiful deep funk and tart, acidic fruit dominate the nose. Notes include: Lemons, tart white grapes, rotten stone fruits, a hint of sweetness, musty basements, old books, oak, sweaty feet, old leather, a touch of ripe cheese, a light rubbery note, very earthy, hay, earthy mushroom, light lactic note, damp and every now and then a meadow like floral note.  This is certainly the best smelling gueuze I have had to date.   Taste: The flavour is just as good as the nose lead on, stunning funkiness and refined tartness. Initially tart lemon and apricot, quickly followed by must basement, old wood, cobwebs, sweaty feet, lots of wet hay, oak, sharp cheese, cider vinegar and earthy mushroom   Mouthfeel: Pretty much bang on for the style - medium body, high level of carbonation. Perfect dry finish and lasting flavour.   Overall: This is an absolutely stunning gueuze, the best I have had to date! I shudder to think how good the Lente is going to be!  I will certainly buy a lot more of this in the future.",0.6777938531695211,4.5,0.9962
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"This is not a normal review because it's from memory from 9/25/13. I felt it was wrong to just ""had"" this gem, and I didn't have anything to write with at the time since I was just going out for dinner and not expecting something so fantastic to be there. Shared this w/ Skrip and another friend at a random place in VT that had it for on site consumption only. The words may be less descriptive than usual since it's from memory, but I the numbers should be spot on because I have pics for appearance, and remember how great it smelled/tasted/felt overall!  2010 vintage  A- Pours a GORGEOUS raspberry pink/red that just glows in the glass! Very minimal head that recedes quickly, leaving little to no lacing. Good carbonation can be seen.  S- My God, this smells fantastic! Super fruity and tart. Raspberries, sour green apples, very light vinegar/acidic smell. It all just explodes out of the glass, beckoning you to take a sip!  T- The taste follows the nose nearly to a T. The sour/tartness is not overwhelming, but it's right there in your face from the start, and leaves a puckering sour snap in the finish. Perhaps not as much raspberries as I'd like, and a bit more vinegar than preferred, but these are minor complaints. There's plenty of oak/tannic character. Not super complex, but delicious!  M- The feel was well carbonated and quite good for the style as it went down smooth, but again with that smack of sour in the finish. The oak yields a mellow feel as well.  O- Overall this was a pleasure to drink. The aroma was top notch, and the taste could stand up to many of the best sours out there. I'm taking off a little extra just because as it warmed a bit past cellar temp (which is what it was served at) the flavor dropped off slightly and became more vinegary (which I don't necessarily mind much, but it took over the raspberries, which I feel are meant to be featured).",0.6707971079511269,4.5,0.9962
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Night of the Funk  A-Pours a beautiful reddish pink. The color is deep and concentrated. Tiny, pinkish head. Very beautiful.  S-Aroma is excellent. Jammy, ripe raspberry. Also there is an abundance of tart raspberry. Sweet and sour all in one. The raspberry is rich and layered. There is also a pleasant oakiness. Another cool component of the nose is this earthy, pungent 'terroir' like aroma. Great aroma.  T-The flavor does not disappoint. The jammy raspberry is big and rich. The tartness is set perfectly. Raspberry flavor like nothing I have come across before. Sweet and sour perfection. The earthy 'terroir' component really sets this beer apart. Oak seals the deal.  M-Puckering and light bodied with tickling bubbles. Tannic. A bit sticky.  O/D-Easily my favorite Framboise. The depth of flavor is impeccable. I was super excited to try this and it blew me away. A delicious beer. Must try the other Lou Pepe brews.",0.6989666333501227,4.75,0.9961
Aaron,"500ml bottle, batch #2, poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass. Enjoyed on 1.30.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal.  The beer pours a dark burgundy color, very opaque with a foamy off white head, bone colored that offers little retention and a few spots of soapy lace. The aroma is unbelievable, tons of caramel, stone fruits, brown sugar with rich grain, figs, smooth toffee forward bourbon with an oak barrel character that brings out a touch of acidity to counterbalance the richness with just a touch of hop. The flavors are wonderful and incredibly complex. Plenty of toffee, caramel, soft and sweet dark grain with a super layered bourbon profile, a touch of vanilla, a bit of spice with charred oak and a touch of acidity that brings out some stone fruits and a touch of boozy warmth lingers. The mouthfeel is great, coating and smooth, very full bodied with low carbonation, but just enough to prop the beer up with a warm and soft finish.  Verdict: A fantastic barleywine from Hill Farmstead, a truly special beer. The complexity is incredible, the balance is fantastic and the depth of flavor achieved is superb. One of the best barleywines I've ever had the pleasure of trying and one of the best beers at that.",0.7137585872818603,4.75,0.9961
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Pours a cloudy golden color with a huge, froth head.  Smells very promising and complex - the nose is filled with dried herbs, lemon zest and a note of orange juice, as well as white bread dough and wet hay. There is a cookie sweetness coming from the hay, which gets almost entirely swallowed by the tart lemon presence, but manages to cut through. A whiff of old basement, together with some wooden mold establish a fantastic counterpart to the bright fruitiness.  Has a soft and light mouthfeel, which got a well nuanced sparkly, mineralic carbonation to it, which becomes most present during the finish, lending a well deserved refreshing note to the beer.  Tastes of ripe wheat, which gets immediatly overpowered by tart lemon and juicy orange, together with a slowly evolving herb dryness of mint and oregano, which turns even more prominent in the finish. Maintains a very pleasant, mellow mouthfeel, which gets complimented by a sparkly, well dosed mineralic carbonation, adding to the dryness. Its cookie sweetness from the nose, together with some subtle blue cheese funk, create a wonderful complexity, which does not distract from the lemon at all.  That is an incredibly well made, complex and tasty beer, it is mindblowingly good. All aspects come together in perfect order, enriching each other, balanced by the fantastic mouthfeel.",0.7233718024658302,4.75,0.9961
Peche 'n Brett,"Big thanks to Libbey for this bottle...  A: Pours a nice cloudy gold with pink/orange hues around the edges. There is a good amount of head, but it settles quickly, leaving a rocky layer across the top of the beer.  S: The nose is huge fruity peach/apricot, a good helping of brett, some additional funk, and touch of fresh cut grass. The peach notes are exactly self evident, but this beer is definitely fruit forward.  T: Right away I get a good mix of fruit and funk. The peaches are there and they mix well with the funky brett, but it's not super intense peach. It's just a nice balance between sweet and tart fruit and brett.  M: Light bodied beer. Good amount of carbonation, sweet to start followed immediately by that familiar brett funk. The flavors last through to the finish where is dries up a bit, leaving some residual funk to the palate.   O: This is a pretty darn good beer. I was really hoping that the peaches would be ridiculously over the top, but it wasn't. Still... the flavors are great and the brett funk is just right. I am incredibly happy to have been able to try this beer, and would love to try it again in the future.",0.6579327796083425,4.25,0.9961
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Drank on-tap at Dark Lord Day 2009 Served in a plastic cup  The beer poured super thick and dense, like used motor oil. Not a ray of light penetrated this sludgy mass. A small, frothy, clingy, coffee-colored head capped the liquid.  The aroma was simply amazing. Sweet, robust and complex with strong indications of oak and bourbon. Lots of vanilla-like sweetness. Some brown sugar and caramel notes appeared as well. Boozy without being overly alcoholic.  The taste was just as astounding as the smell. Sweet, rich malts came through strong up front. Coffee-like. Deep and dark yet super smooth and not overly roasty. Bourbon and molasses were also noticeable. Lots of vanilla and oak too. Dark fruits appeared in the center. The lingering finish was oaky and whiskey-like. Brown sugar notes were apparent. Overall, incredibly interesting and quite complex.  The mouthfeel was ridiculously good. Ultra-heavy and creamy with a fine, mild carbonation. If there is a more rich and dense brew out there, I have yet to try it.  Drinkability was simply off the charts. The beer was incredibly smooth and balanced. Sweet for the style without being cloying. At 15% ABV, it drank like something half its strength.  This beer alone made my 1,000 mile journey to Dark Lord Day 2009 worth it. Simply put, Oak Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout is the best beer to ever pass my lips.",0.7122448659881869,5.0,0.996
Blanc De Blancs,"Much thanks to a good friend for sharing his bottle with me a few weeks ago. Enjoyed out of a green 375 mL bottle but I was not able to catch the bottling date (if there was one). Poured into a small Belgian-style tulip glass.  Appearance (4.5) - Pours a hazy golden color that reminds me of the color of an egg yolk, but with more notes of orange and amber going on than what you'd expect. The head is about a finger at most and a fairly stark/snow white in color. It doesn't last long before fading to a ringlet around the edges of the glass and just a faint swirl of foam across the surface of the liquid.  Smell (4.5) - There are a few key elements present which all combine quite nicely. Of course, there is a fantastic lactic acidity that makes my tastebuds pucker slightly in anticipation before ever taking a sip. But alongside that, the vinous characteristics of white wine and oak, with even perhaps a hint of vanilla. And finally, there is a subtle hint of white grape tartness that is different in nature from the bacteria-based sourness that is clearly present. It adds a depth to the sourness that might not be there without the fruit. I can't wait to dive into this and drink it.  Taste (4.75) - The flavor does not disappoint, with all of the elements that presented themselves in the aroma pushing through in equal parts. Woody, musty oak and lactic sourness leads the way, inducing a nice satisfying pucker and refreshing tartness. As with the smell, the inclusion of the wine grapes gives a bit of juicy sourness that balances nicely alongside some funky, yogurt-like characteristic. The finish is where the chardonnay comes through, with crisp granny smith apple and white grape lingering on the palate.  Mouthfeel (4.5) - Medium-bodied and moderately carbonated, with a lingering dry finish that entices the next sip.  Overall (4.5), a fabulous beer, and my first in the Biere Brut style, although I can't imagine that this take could be considered typical. It's amazing to me just how sourness as a flavor profile can screw with one's perception of ABV level in a beer. This one certainly didn't give away it's 10% abv, and I've had other sour beers that were bursting with flavor but only had 3-4% abv. I would gladly drink this often if it was easier to get. A fabulous and unique offering from Side Project.",0.7029982797419514,4.5,0.996
Society & Solitude #4,"Picked up a hard fought growler of this at the Hill Farmstead Civ 4 bottle release. Poured into my Duvel tulip.  A - Pours a nice slightly hazy dark straw pour with a nice two finger sudsy white head that leaves good side lacing and a nice creamy blanket.  S - Wow, HUGE amounts of tropical notes. Big orange and pineapple and mango. Super fresh hops here. Just outstanding.  T - Yeah, outstanding. Huge amounts of bitter, delicious hops. Almost bubblegummy with big orange peel and pineapple. Absolutely delicious. Very strong, bitter finish. Alcohol not even slightly noticeable. So, so good.  M - Mouthfeel is solid, bitter, like chewing on hops. Nice lower level carbonation. Stuff drinks wonderfully.  O - Overall this is an exceptional DIPA. Its just outstanding and amazing how Shaun can create such wonderful brews.",0.6712689824007061,5.0,0.996
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Shared with JLindros.  A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice dark oily black with a thin mocha head that fades to leave nice wisp and blanket.  S - Aromas of excellent barrel notes, lovely bourbon, nice cinnamon, good spicy peppers, good chocolate. Really pleasant.  T - Taste is similar to the nose, really really nice cinnamon, lovely peppers, great chocolate. The bourbon is very nice with just huge coconut barrel notes. Enormous.   M - Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, creamy, smooth, alcohol hidden wonderfully.  O - Overall this was a very very good stout. Excellent job here.   Serving Type: bottle",0.6688500338988138,4.75,0.996
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"750mL corked & capped bottle poured into a stemmed glass. 2006 vintage, bottledon Sept. 1st, 2008.   (A)- Pours a deep blood red color that produced a good white to pink head that dissipated down to bubbles.   (S)- A sour yet super ripe tart cherry & raspberry fruits. A dense smell of a bread-like oakiness behind all the fruits that are almost creamy from the oak. A beautiful aroma.   (T)- Wow, a super duper sour punch up front with a kiss of tart cherry & raspberry fruits. Has a sour midpalate that turns dry and wood-like with more fruits. Finishes with the same super sour fruit flavor, but it all meshes together well. Some serious hay & horseblanket funk at the end too.   (M)- A huge fizzy carbonation level that creates a huge party in the mouth. Lightly sweet with a potent tart/sour kick that makes you smack your lips after each sip. A good fruitiness to balance it out. My only complaint is how high the carbonation level really is; could have toned down a bit, but I just gave it more time to breath once opened; it got much better after that.   (D)- One of the most sour beers I have ever had; but it is very good. A huge sour kick with some good fruits; a funkiness that I appreciated & enjoyed. One of the better lambics I have ever had. Now I need to try the Kriek. Cantillon knows their sours!",0.6679908467149583,4.5,0.996
Society & Solitude #4,"I've heard a lot about Hill Farmstead and the beers that I've had from Hill Farmstead prior to this have been great to oh my god fantastic. I was in Vermont for the weekend and I have Everett, Edward, and Walden. While I though all were good, only Everett was amazing to me. Now, I barely got three growlers of HFS at the brewery because I overlooked the fact that they were cash only. Anyway, I got three smaller growlers and I'll review Susan and Abner when I have then.   I'm not going to do a full ASTMO review, but this beer was incredible. While a lot of IPAs get that citrus grapefruit-y flavor, #4 gets more of oranges. It's sweeter and tangier. It's got a little more of that creamy IPA goodness you'd get from an IPA that has more of that banana/guava goodness. Overall, Society and Solitude #4 will leave you wanting more because it is so damn good.  I thoroughly enjoyed my trip, but this makes me feel grateful to be home and enjoy such a great beer.  Upon revisiting this beer, it's as good as I remember. It's like orange soda without so much sweetness. It's a brilliant feat in the DIPA game. The aromatics, the taste, the feel, it's just so perfect. Considering the two influences, Double Galaxy and Double Citra, are so good. It should be no surprise. This is my favorite DIPA.",0.5941976312727533,5.0,0.996
Fort Point Pale Ale,"Traded for this a while ago, as the date on the bottom of the can read 1/24/17 with ""HOW ABOUT NO"" written below that. It's easy to see how this would be Trillium's flagship offering as this was quite heavy, dank, and tasty at the same time, while being a good example of what an American Pale Ale should be. Even though this can was two years old, it aged well and had very little sediment in it, as the flavors held up quite well over time!  This had a nice pour to it as the liquid was a quietly radiant apricot with a fair head topping it off. A thin ring of lacing was left around the top of my pint glass as the faint collar was the best residue that I could find. A few soapy sections remained as I worked my way through this but it was disappointing for something that was quite enjoyable. Lots of bright stone fruit, peach, wheat, and white grape could be found in the varied nose as the taste had quite a range of flavors to it as well. Light wood, citrus pith, and a subtle earthiness could be found on the palate as this warmed up as I enjoyed the nuances of this beer. Moderately slick and lightly carbonated, this felt like Hawaiian Punch in the aftertaste as the tropical and juicy notes lingered on my tongue once the liquid fully went down...  Not a lot of booze to this as this truly was an American Pale Ale and not an IPA that went by another name. Balanced in body, there was little sediment in the liquid or at the bottom of my pint glass once I finished this off. Certainly enjoyable, this wasn't a standout beer but had enough going for it that the hype wasn't entirely unjustified. Fans of Trillium would be wise to see this out although it's certainly not a hop bomb or full of dankness. Instead, this was a beer that anyone could easily embrace, since there was enough to like about it from the get-go!",0.6811343841153442,4.25,0.9959
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"There are very few master pieces these days, but this is beyond exceptional.   Pours dark, thick, deep, legs for days.  The nose is the deepest of dark chocolates, roasted malt, and a wonderful vanilla/oak finish that only bourbon can provide.   Ignore the meaningless looks, smell or whatever else. This is a master piece. The moves through the dark barrel flavors, dark rich malts, perfectly complemented with bourbon sweetness. This might be the most perfect example of the dark forward deep roasted notes from an imperial stout. That said for those of you looking for more complexity there's no lack of dark fruit and nuts in the back ground adding an amazing amount of complexity.   So often lately I've been saying imperial stouts were a bit thin, I was starting to think I was losing my mind. This has restored faith to my needs, rich, thick, creamy, lush. A true honest goodness master piece.  This is about as good as a stout gets folks. I just hope this doesn't become impossible to get. I should give it a 1 just to protect us barrel aged lovers.",0.692956407534953,5.0,0.9959
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Poured from the bottle into a snifter glass at Churckey DC for Zwanze 2013. Vintage 2010.  Deep dark red, nearly cherry, but just a touch of pink with a good thick collar that stays of pink bubbles.  The bouquet on the Lou Pepe is the perfect match of sweetness and tartness balanced, with perhaps the light funk and acid edging out just nicely enough. Sweet raspberry with a moderate funk kick. Hints of lemon also seem to burst out as well.  Palate comes with less funk and acid than expected. Fruit forward raspberries with a very light palate. Great mixture of sweet and tartness, but the acid and raspberry sensing sourness is predominant. Light pepper finish, with some hinting sweetness as well.  Overall a great example of a framboise of a different nature. Surprising example of what sweet and sour can accomplish in a beer.",0.6955885440016824,4.5,0.9959
Flora - Blueberry,"First review in months. Been slacking, but I figured Blueberry Flora was a good time to start up again.   Pours a radiant dark blush purple, gorgeous fizzy head tinged with color highlights of the brew itself. Head settles quickly and leaves a beer much in common with a Shiraz in appearance.    Aroma is big wine barrel presence, raspberry much in the framboise nature, blueberry jam, oak, and soft vanilla. Big, juicy, bright nose on this. Most barrel I've had in my nostrils from Hill Farmstead.   Taste reveals another beautifully balanced masterpiece by Shaun. The fruit is front and center giving way to dried blueberries, raspberry skin, grape sweetness, and some wine grape tannins. The woodsy oak and vanilla add depth while base flora flavors come through giving off some flower notes and a more tropical type of fruit vibe.    Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lower carbonation level, and the lowest end I've encountered from the brewer. But there is enough to prickle the taste buds and help clean the fruity flavors away. Tart but not super sour much to my liking.    Overall a brilliant brew that has so much in common with fresh lambic krieks and framboise. Balance, raw fruit nature, subtle funk, and lovely oak properties to round out and perpetuate complexity. But the wine barrel elevates this to the level of Lou Pepes vs standard fruit lambics. Don't get me wrong, this is unique in every way possible and the lambic connection is really only meant to be taken with a grain of salt. It's the depth which makes me relate this to the fruited lambic realm. Highly recommended, will go down in the books as one of those memorable drinking experiences.",0.7143431102962619,4.75,0.9959
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"I enjoyed this brew outside, on the patio, after spending a few hours tending to the lawn. It's an amazingly refreshing and complex thirst-quencher. It's also the kind of framboise that you can just sit and sip, slowly enjoying it. The beer pours a deep, dark, but clear red. Although it pours with a slight head, it quickly disappears. The beautiful color and clarity, however, more than make up for the head...great appearance. The aroma is a great mix of raspberries and sour funk. Horse-stall, sweaty, earthy, musty aromas mix with just-picked berries. At least half of the fun of this beer is the smell. The sourness in the taste is very strong, but not overdone. Mouthpuckering and intense, but balanced with some fruit flavors. The barnyard character comes through in the taste as well. I love these lambics that don't ruin the experience with sweetness. Perfect to sit and sip. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but the drinkability on this one is fantastic.",0.6981460103265609,4.5,0.9959
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2012 sticker date. Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Cantillon stemmed lambic glass. Allowed to warm to just under room temperature over 3 hours.   Pours a maroon body with a pretty big, 3 finger light pink, fizzy head that dissipates pretty quickly to leave no retention or lacing.   Wow.. the aromas on this baby are mesmerizing - a huge wave of fresh raspberries fills the air. So much fruit here. Light funk and oak on the aromas but fresh, bright berries dominate.   On the tongue, it starts with fresh, sour raspberry juice notes.. really delicate but pronounced. This gives way to a good amount of oak, lactic sourness, earthy light funk, finishing crisp, clean, acidic, tannic almost. Ever so slightly sweet. Mouthfeel is fantastic - medium carbonation, and medium light, easy drinking body.   I can see why the Lou Pepe series is sought after, these beers are true masterpieces. I wouldn't say this beer is overly COMPLEX, being pretty fresh the berries dominate, but that's exactly why it's so great. World class.",0.7107579799270385,4.75,0.9959
Nelson,"This review is in regards to Alpine's original gangster version and not the GF brewed bottles and or draft editions.  Appearance: opaque, hazy, kind of turbid but a vibrant yellowish gold color with slight orange hues. normal level pour creates a nice medium-ish white soapy, fluffy frothy head. This beer sort of looks like some Heffs.   Aroma: sweet orange juice, white grape notes. Pretty intense smelling tropical fruit blend rounded out with the rye component. Rye is not very detectable but compliments the other strong aromas very well.  Taste: Citrus fruit juice, sweet papaya notes, sweet oranges, the slight slight bitterness is akin to grapefruit rind and pith as opposed to aggressive pine dank super hoppy bitterness. sometimes I get a little bit of awesome lemon flavor too but not in a sour or weird manner. oh, and drinkable as hell. like just simply delicious.

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"i feel like the base expedition stout is an early cellar beer for a lot of budding beer geeks. its widely available, ages with the best of them, and fairly affordable. i think its been over hyped to some degree as a result, but i still adore it. this bourbon barrel aged edition is next level, but has surprisingly no hype at all. must be that its not packaged, but it absolutely should be. hear that bells?! do it up! its great beer, still huge and roasty with dark espresso and yeasty dryness, but the bourbon brings out the best of the malt, char and char, vanilla and honey, and a wooded smoothness thats just amazing in the already huge bodied luxurious brew. still more bitter than sweet, which i really admire in stout this big, its true to that. its also not overly flavored by the barrels, or changed too much, its more accentuating and highlighting various features, and it does so sequentially and beautifully. i think this should be packaged, straight up. these guys are big enough now to pull the resources together to make it happen, and i think a lot of us out here in beer geek land have been waiting patiently. i almost wish i never tried it, because now i want it more than ever. really top notch. hard to improve on a classic, but theyve come real close to doing that...",0.6580768578830405,4.25,0.9959
Madagascar,"2015 vintage drank out of a bottle in a snifter on 12/29/2015.  Look - Motor oily thick and extremely impressive lacing for a 9% milk stout. This is a quite nice start to this beer.  Smell - vanilla marshmallow at the forefront. Also some nice notes of chocolate and cocoa with a little bit of roast, toffee, and coffee as well.  Taste - love this. The vanilla is excellent but not overpowering. The bourbon really comes out more and more as it warms, but the balance continues to get better and better. The oak comes out nicely after a little warming too. Some sweet dark chocolate adds to the mix, but nothing overly complex. A very enjoyable mix of flavors.  Feel - very creamy. Not super thick, but this goes down very easily with minimal booze. A little heavy on the carbonation, but impacts more as it goes down and not on the flavor profile.  Overall - a great beer. Had this at FOBAB and sought out some bottles from this release and extremely glad I did. It's certainly no FO or VR, but it's a very strong vanilla stout and I will seek this one out annually. Love 4 Hands more and more every beer I try of theirs!",0.6863019701084444,4.75,0.9958
Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,"375ml bottle, undated, 2017 release, poured into a 14oz snifter glass. Enjoyed on 10.21.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal.  The beer pours a jet black color, inky, oily, sludgy and viscous with a thin head, khaki colored with no retention nor lace. The aroma is fantastic, tons of chocolate, bittersweet but rich with a strong barrel character, lots of bourbon, charred oak and toffee with some molasses and caramel and strong roasted grains with a warm alcohol heat. The flavors are excellent, rich chocolate, super smooth and decadent with a very intense barrel expression, loads of bourbon, spicy and bringing out some caramel and vanilla with a strong charred oak flavor, roasted grain, light molasses and toffee with some stone fruits and licorice. The mouthfeel is perfect, sludge, heavy body that is coating and smooth with a chewy and thick full finish.  Verdict: An exceptional barrel aged stout from Jackie O's and Side Project. It's got everything a barrel aged stout needs to have, a thick body, a complex and delicate flavor profile weaving chocolate, bourbon, oak, and stone fruits into a beautiful product that doesn't need to rely on any adjuncts. Just a stunner of a beer.",0.6949280290463071,4.5,0.9958
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"This is the 2006 Dark Lord, aged for a year in Woodford's Reserve Bourbon Barrels, and released on draught only just in time for the release of the 2007 Dark Lord in bottles. Better than the 2006 non-BA release, though I think the 2007 non-BA Dark Lord is easily better than both. I can't wait for the 2008 Dark Lord Day so I can try the 2007 BA Dark Lord.  The beer pours to a thick dark sludge with very little head, probably destroyed by the spirits it has been aging with. Shows off thick caramel colored legs as it is swished around, and by the time the glass is empty, the glass looks almost like the brown bottle the beer was poured from (err... maybe not, since this is actually a draught, but you get the point).  The smell is great. Has a strong whiff of bourbon/alcohol with vanilla and coconut notes from the barrel. Smells quite sweet, remnant of all of the sugars used in the production of this beer, namely molasses and brown sugar. Little dark roasted malt in the nose, but a generous hit of caramel.  The taste is good. Very rich and sweet up front with a huge taste of bourbon, namely the aforementioned vanilla and coconut. Has a middle taste of rich, dark chocolate, coffee roast, and soy sauce. The finish refuses to go away.  The body is a bit thinner than the non-BA Dark Lord, also with a little less carbonation. Still coats the mouth with a thick molasses consistency. Turns your teeth into a caramel brown color. Not an easy beer to drink on a hot and sunny day after I've already been drinking several beers of considerable strength and body. I REALLY wanted to drink a Gumballhead at that time, but I simply couldn't pass up a one-time opportunity like this.",0.6042360022712089,4.0,0.9958
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"750ml $22 Binny's Orland  Lou Pepe Framboise glimmers a brilliant ruby red in my oversized flute. Faded orange highlights the body near the stem of the glass. A pink tinted head snaps to attention at over a finger in height before fizzling down to a skim coat. The collar is rather thick and leaves behind thin sheet lacing. The color of this beer is amazing.  Ahhh...Cantillon! That incredible Cantillon funk is present in all it's glory. Crazy amounts of mustiness cradle every other aspect of the nose and there's a bracing green raspberry and vinegar sourness that instantly makes my mouth water uncontrollably. A mild but interesting floral quality sneaks up along with a touch of Sweet Tart sweetness. I could happily take deep whifs of this beer all night long.  Each drink is cheek puckeringly sour. Green, underripe raspberries get things moving and they're as musty as ever. A Sweet Tart candy like sweetness comes across mid palate while trying to balance out the sourness and falling miserably short. Dusty, funkiness runs throughout this entire beer. Another absolutely delicious Cantillon. The raspberry seems to ripen up as this warms.  A light body combines with the puckering sourness that I get used to halfway through the glass. The carbonation is tiny and somewhat prickly. It does a great job of scrubbing the tongue clean after each drink.   Drinkability is off the charts. The acidity will bring along the heartburn but it's worth it for a beer of this caliber. The light body and refreshing sourness make this bottle disappear far too quickly.  Lou Pepe Framboise is another gem of a beer coming from Cantillon. Great raspberry flavor and great sourness. I won't be drinking this often because of the price tag but it will be in the rotation from now on.  Reviewed: 6/22/09",0.6604096943950639,4.5,0.9958
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"750ml C&C format; bottled April 26, 2011.  poured into tulip glass.  Appearance: deep dark red bodied beer with a full finger of white head. Head drops down to a thin ring. 3.75  Smell: slightly sweet but more so tart cherries and moderate oak notes. Musty and dusty signature Fonteinen funkiness. 4.5  Taste: Moderately tart cherries. Moderate funkiness that is musty and dusty just like how the nose smells. Earthy and oaky barrel notes; its also tannic with a touch of leather. A light, fruity, and slightly spicy yeast. Sweet tarts candies. Very balanced and complex. The finish is moderately tart cherries and red apple skin with loads of oak barrel. 4.5  Mouthfeel: low end of a medium bodied beer with low end of moderate carbonation. The beer is a touch above semidry, but also that awesome mouthwatering quality too. Nice drinkable sour that not too tart. 4.75  Overall: This is a great Kreik! I really enjoyed it. It my favorite 3F Kriek that I have drank. The price tag is pretty hefty at $40 includuing tax. Great beer for a one time splurge. Its the most money that I have spent on a sour beer in 750 format. I can definately find alot of similiarites with the 3F Oude Kriek and Schaerbeekse Kriek. 4.50  2011 review score: 4.50  ---  Opened this up for my local tasting group on 10/15/2013!  750 C&C bottle with black foil over the C&C. Vintage 2010; bottled on April, 28, 2010.  poured into tulip glass.  Appearance: crimson rosey red bodied beer with a thin white cap that drops to a ring around the glass. 3.75  Smell: Cherry jolly rancher candies. Vinegar and acetic notes in the nose. Even more cherries in the nose! 4.25  Taste: This is really tart/sour! Cherry notes of course. Slight cheesy lacto funk. Raspberries and cherry skins are noticed in finish. On the high end of moderately tart in finish and even through out the beer. 4.5  Mouthfeel: light bodied beer almost medium body. Low carbonation levels almost moderately carbonated. This beer is somewhere between a semi dry and fully dry sour beer, but closer to the fully dry end of the spectrum. 4.5  Overall: One year makes a big difference with this 3F beer! I give the slight edge to the 2011 vintage of Schaerbeekse Kriek for its huge cherry flavor and its a bit better balanced, but truely love the dryness and higher level of sourness in the 2010 vintage. Either way it a world class Kriek! 4.25  2010 review score: 4.36",0.6736700667788863,4.5,0.9958
Chocolate Rain,"750 ml wax-dipped bottle poured into a Bruery tulip. 18.5% ABV, 2014, Best stored and cellared around 55°F   A - Pouring thick and rich, this (surprisingly) dark brown beer's high alcohol content drives the tan foam to a thin halo almost immediately but, give this boozy beer a swirl and legs will drip down the glass for what seems like forever.  S - Thick soy sauce cakes grain alcohol-soaked raisins while molasses seeps through faint charred oak barrels that once held bourbon. Until the beer sits and really warms up, chocolate isn't even part of the picture but, it's milky nose peeks through with whole vanilla beans for a more pleasant olfactory experience.  T - A trail mix of dark chocolate morsels, booze-soaked raisins, creamy vanilla yogurt bites, and caramel-draped charred oak cubes fill the mouth with potency, almost completely overlapping the bourbon barrel character, save for the whole booze-soaked raisin part. It's damn tasty - much tastier than the outrageous nose lets on, but it's comes across more like straight grain alcohol was added to the beer once inside a charred oak barrel.  M - If it weren't for the onslaught of alcohol, Chocolate Rain might otherwise come across as a thick, throat-coating imperial stout. The truth of the matter is, there's so much freakin' alcohol in this beer that it cuts the full-bodied feel with thinning solvent heat that carries from mid gulp down the throat where it perpetually warms the stomach. It's creamy smoothness makes for a nice sipping beer when the potent alcohol is cast aside, though!  O - Here I sit, reviewing The Bruery's Chocolate Rain in my Bruery hat, feeling kind of silly about that. ...And the fact that I just absently dropped a rhyme. Moving right along... Chocolate Rain shows some serious promise but like Bourbon County Stout, I couldn't possibly see myself truly enjoying this beer fresh ever again. If I crave hard alcohol (which I almost never do) I'll pour myself hard alcohol. Chocolate Rain's Tripel Bock-like soy sauce nose is immediately off-putting but slowly opens up to richer nuances, transitioning into a fuller, more rich flavor of chocolate, vanilla tannins, and some trace of actual beer instead of solvent alcohol. I never age a beer I haven't had fresh but I'll count this as a learning experience; The Bruery's Chocolate Rain will probably be exceptional with 2-3 years of sitting in a cool, dark room on it which is the only way I'll have a bottle of my own next time.",0.6319197124098039,4.0,0.9958
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Thanks to Ben for sharing this. Incredibly sweet and fruity from the nose to the taste. It does go overboard on the sweetness, but the fruit character is amazing. It has all the dark fruit normally associated with imperial stout like raisins and especially figs, but it goes beyond that to blend in brighter fruit flavors like apple and cherry that really make it pop. I checked the bottle to make sure this was the bourbon version and not Portuguese brandy. All of that fruit shows in the slight reddish hue of the pour and blends perfectly with the chocolate and molasses flavors. This never gets tart and you never feel like the fruit is taking the place of other stout flavors. I don't get a lot of barrel character or bourbon and the booze is barely noticeable considering the abv. The mouth feel is full but super smooth at the same time. I wish it had more barrel character and less sweetness, but it's so rich and smooth and full of complex fruit flavors.",0.6860659962586303,4.5,0.9958
Society & Solitude #4,"Poured from growler taken from brewery in less than 18 hour period poured into a Hill Farmstead wine glass.  A slight dull lemony yellow body, but some nice faint green hues here also ever so slight. Opaque. Easily one to two finger rich creamy white and merringue head, thick clumps of lacing, big retention, lots of staying power. Wonderful looking brew.  What a great nose on this. Citrus and tropical hob bomb, without the mushy sweetness. Smells like fresh tropical fruit from the island. Mango, faint peach, incredibly fleshy, with warm earthy hop tones, and even a grain fresh ripping malt sense. Unreal.  Taste brings pure magic. Juicy palate and wonderful tropical fruit punch body, with a good thickness. Hop juice finish, mild resin, with big hints of mango and soft baguette dough french bread on the aftertaste. Full, rich, luscious.  Overall just and amazing creation, flooring. Just a stunning brew. Reminds me of a superior Odell Myrcenary.",0.6973870768641531,5.0,0.9958
Enjoy By IPA,"Damn if that isn’t one of the freshest IPAs I’ve had in a long time. I thought the “enjoy by” thing on the front of the can might have been a gimmick, and surely this beer couldn’t be as good as the reviews say? But it was everything I could have hoped for, and more. Nice bright light copper-amber color with some foamy head and just a trace of spotty lingering lacing. Smells great, nice big bold citrus zest aromas with a little pine in the background. Tastes amazing. Loads of fresh citrus fruit - passionfruit, orange, tangerine, mango, grapefruit, lemon - as well as piney hops, floral hops, vanilla, bread and a great well-balanced malt backbone. So smooth, easy to drink and great mild mouthfeel. Just the right amount of carbonation. It’s additionally an imperial IPA but you’d never guess it since the higher ABV is well-hidden and the bitterness is just right, not too bracing, not too subtle. An outstanding beer and I will venture back to a local pub to sample this one on tap.",0.6973701822826321,4.25,0.9958
Beatification,"finally! this is one beer i have wanted to try more than any other, it was my number one whale, and now it has been enjoyed. at long last, and it did not disappoint. hazy blonde in color without a ton of head, but some clearish white fizz holds on for a few minutes and the beer is visibly bubbly, even though not much head ever accumulates. looks like a gueuze. the nose is awesome, just awesome, not overly sour as say consecration, but it definitely brings a pucker for me. lots of musty wood too, wine citrus overtones and a vinegar hit on the back end. i taste grain first, which really surprises me, and its more musty than sour. sanctification has a certain acidity not found here, but the sour element is very similar. the finish is long, even though its really dry, i taste it for miles. furthermore, i get this harvest time straw or hay element, grassy, but not from hops, its wheated all the way through, and while being sour, is also so much more in terms of yeast. its beautiful beer really. bright carbonation and a body short of medium, it drinks really easy because its not so acidic. not as interesting or layered as some of the other sours, but a great example of a wild ale, one of the best i can remember. comes up just short of the hype, but thats still a remarkable achievement with this one.",0.662974737008102,4.5,0.9958
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),DLD.  A: The beer looked no different than the vanilla version. A super thick BLACK beer with no head with only a few bubbles. Also this beer had legs.  S: The nose was so rich and not as one dimensional as the vanilla. The bourbon was a real treat. Also this was 2010 dark lord so it had some time to chill out. The bourbon was up front but with the diminished booziness of fresh DL it worked out well and took that and replaced it with something you wanted to smell.  T: One of the best bourbon barrel beers that I have ever had. The complexity was off the charts and it did not come across as sweet like the vanilla version. Both were excellent but I preferred this.  M: Super thick with almost no carbonation. A joy.  D: I had 2 samples of each version. I tried going back for a third but friends settled me into getting a dreadnaught and calming down. It was worth the price and the blend of both was amazing. It was worth the 5 hours we were in line to get some.,0.6266231334419852,4.5,0.9957
Haze,"From 16oz can packaged 13 days ago, enjoyed in a swell tulip glass after coaching a BU14 evening soccer practice.

Beatification,"Wow, mouth puckering sour this one is.  Pours a hazy golden color with a thin white head, but doesn't last long. Aroma is full of tart citrus like lemon zest and grapefruit. Maybe a touch of green apple and oak. Flavor is so full and complex and overwhelmingly sour, somewhat to it's detriment. I think I enjoy a well blended sour like Temptation to unblended. I enjoy the wild fermentation process to get these amazingly complex beers but the sourness somewhat detracts from what it is your drinking. Flavor is like strong lemon mixed with touches of green apple like the nose suggests but extremely sour, not much funk, it's a nice and fresh sour. Mouthfeel is great, low carbonation probably helps with the high acidity in this beer. Overall great beer for being unblended, glad I got to try it, definitely had to rest the tastebuds after this one.",0.70169634679481,4.5,0.9957
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"750ml bottle 15.0% Abv.  Served lightly chilled in an over sized wine glass 2012 Vintage  Bottle Number: 393/688  I am not sure I can thank futura123 enough for sending this my way, I never thought I would get the chance to try the bourbon version of one of my favorite beers!   Appearance: As with the regular Dark Lord, the barrel aged version pours out thick and viscous. The beer appears pitch black in the glass, but a back light reveals some deep red along the edges. A rough pour yields a small, creamy, tan coloured head that, as expected, fizzes away pretty quickly. A swirl coats the glass in a thick yellow tinted film, that fades into heavy alcohol legs.   Smell: Good lord, as with the regular DL, the nose here is absolutely sublime! If you don’t like sweet beers, I think this is one to avoid! The initial nose offers copious amounts of sweet toffee, chocolate fudge, salted caramel, caramelized (nearly burned) brown sugar, bourbon and sweet vanilla. Further contemplation and warming yields: Liquorice, a little coffee, dark fruits (cherries and raisins), oak and molasses.   Taste: As the nose promised, this is one of the most delicious beers in all of beerdom, I have a feeling that my glass is going to disappear far quicker than it should! Flavour notes include: Sweet toffee, chocolate, caramel, fudge, butterscotch, bourbon, vanilla, oak, caramelized sugar, dark fruits, molasses and liquorice. There is a touch of the 15% noted in the finish, but I couldn’t bring myself to dock a point for this as the rest of the flavour is just that good!   Mouthfeel: Perfect, absolutely perfect! The body is thick, chewy and quite sticky, with a medium level (usually too high for my tastes, but it works so well in this case) of insanely smooth carbonation.   Overall: Bourbon Dark Lord is one of the few beers that far exceeds any and all hype surrounding it - this is easily one of the best beers I have ever had had!

Space Trace,"Space Trace is one of two beers procured by friends who wanted to help me out after my Dark Lord bottles were stolen. I don't know how they made this happen - something about New Glarus Strawberry Rhubarb bottles - but, I love Bottle Logic, and I was ecstatic to have the opportunity to try Space Trace.  I was really startled by how barrel-forward Space Trace is. I'm a bit accustomed at this point to how vanilla forward many of their beers tend to be - but Space Trace smacks you in the face right away with a strong barrel nose and taste. It's follow by lots of chocolate and coconut, with very pleasant bourbon notes. It's a thick, rich beer, which is a very nice change from thin coconut beers (typically rum barrel-aged).  While I really love Space Trace, it's one that doesn't drink itself - it's delicious, but it's an active drinker - it requires attention and appreciation. I could only drink just a bit of it - certainly not a whole bottle - at a sitting. Then again, it's summer - so it may just be a seasonal thing!

Peche 'n Brett,"Serving Type: Bottle Best By: 1/2020 Consumed: 4/11/15  A: 4.5 Quite a pretty beer; pours a slightly hazy, orange-gold. The two inch, off-white head lasts a couple minutes and leaves good lacing.  S: 4.5 Tons of peach. More fruit than I’ve smelled in just about any beer. Smells rather sweet with a lot of very ripe, candied peach. A very small amount of brett and funk comes through and a touch of white wine on the finish.   T: 4.75 While the nose is dominated by peaches, the flavor is a bit more interesting and nuanced. Peach is still up front, but the brett really comes through here adding a nice, dryness to counter the relatively sweet peach. White wine, some herbs (thyme maybe?) and oak round out the finish with little bit of lingering bitterness.  M: 4.5 Great body and carbonation and rather dry. Super refreshing for 10% abv.  O: 4.5 This is a super intense peach beer and it works really well. I love the base beer and the addition of peaches is an excellent compliment. If it was a little more tart, this beer would be perfect, but, as a fruited saison, it doesn’t get much better.",0.6602655193076096,4.5,0.9957

Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"Dusty old brownish black like old used motor oil, it pours murky and viscous. Small discreet discrete brown head components come together with a vigorous pour, but give up the ghost pretty quick. Murky.  Nose... Oh man. Even just off the pour it's boozy in a good way with maple and dark sugars. Maybe some rich molasses on the edges. Woody and a hint of tobacco/leather. Muffled chocolate.   Starts off with almost more dark fruits than I expected, the sweetness meanders past hints of oak and confronts a molasses bite gilded with maple syrup inlay and ultimately plated with a booziness that's not quite harsh, but will certainly not go quietly. As it warms, it mellows into more of the maple and de-emphasizes the molasses and other sharper notes. Just gets better and better.  Medium body and higher carbonation than I prefer this one is still a big winner for me. The maple shares space with almost more of a molasses crudity but, though I would prefer a stronger maple lead, it still works really well for me. The biggest gripe I have with this beer is that it's only available on the other side of the country, so I'll be reliant on the kindness of strangers to get ahold of it again.

Chocolate Rain,"2013 bottle, poured in a snifter. It's possible I will be downing the bottle (and might be close already). High hopes after the hype/ratings, and my recent love for Black Tuesday.  A: Dark, and thin appearance/runny, but not translucent thin. Doesn't hold on the glass at all, very fluid.   Smell: Brown sugar, raisins and booze. Definitely some vanilla smell coming through too.  Taste: Sweet, sweet, sweet. Very sweet (did I mention that?). Starts with a lot of sugary vanilla and chocolate, chocolate and caramel even, and leaves me thinking of sugared raisins. Brown sugared raisins. Slightly boozy, but surprisingly low for how strong this is. More sugary raisin aftertaste as I think on it. A bit sweeter than I would prefer (I guess just give me Black Tuesday).  Mouthfeel: Could be thicker, but fairly syrupy too. Obviously similar to Black Tuesday.  Overall: initially thought it was too sweet. After nearly a 750ml bottle down, I still think its a bit too sweet. All that aside, it's still really good. I prefer BT, but am very happy to have had a chance to try this. Wouldn't pass on a glass if it were poured for me, especially after warming a bit. Curious to see how this would age, possibly some sweetness from the vanilla would fade. But might lose a little of the booze too (which surprisingly isn't too much).

Long, clean, tart finish. Absolutely delicious.  M: Frothy, creamy, lively, smooth medium body. Excellent.  O: This is a top-notch fruit Lambic, with emphasis roundly on the fruit. I drank this back-to-back with Rose de Gambrinus '09, and there was seriously no comparison. As good as that beer is, the LP is better in every conceivable way (except, of course, the label;).

Smell: Mainly band aid and plastic (reduced quite a bit when the beer warmed up more) from the brett that comes off like a milder version of the smell that crushed stink bugs make with some tropical fruit notes (apricot, mango, tangerine, and grapefruit) from the hops. As the beer warms the stink bug juice transforms magically into a light funk level of brett. I'd give this one a 4.25 if I could so I'm rounding up a bit.  Taste: More enjoyable than the nose in my opinion. The yeast character is much more prominent and is very well integrated with the malt and hops. In addition to a light funk up front, that oh so lovely brett derived lemon note appears in the finish too. The hops definitely play a bit more of a supporting role in this beer than I expected them to. I get some white wine character similar to Nelson Sauvin in the hop profile as well, but I believe that is coming from the mimosa barrel used, since I believe it was a white wine barrel that also housed some citrus (orange rind).   Mouthfeel: Light side of medium bodied with medium carbonation comprised of very soft billowy bubbles. Not as dry as I expected and that might actually be a good thing.  Overall: I would drink this beer constantly if I had the opportunity. What a lovely hoppy wild saison. The flavors are so well layered and compliment each other fantastically. Truly gestalt in nature. Kudos to Hill Farmstead for making such a progressive and delicious beer! The hops combined with the brett is what makes this one truly special so consuming it fresh is a big factor in having the experience I've outlined.",0.6769897046776545,5.0,0.9956
Oude Geuze Vintage,"2002 red label with the hand written dates. Thanks Dave!  Pours a slightly cloudy orange with a big foamy white head. The foam eventually reduces to a thin white film. Light patchy lacing. Looks great.  Earthy, floral, orange citrus and oak on the nose, accompanied by a large amount of barnyard funk and wet hay. Vanilla and a hint of lemon zest in the background. This is exceptional. An amazing nose. So much funk and complexity.  Orange citrus, earthy hay and lots of dry brett on the tongue. Grassy with a touch of oak. Orange peel and faint lemon. This is well done, but doesn't quite live up to the nose. I think the brett has become a little too dominant at this point. Earthy malt and funky sourness throughout.  The mouthfeel is clean, dry and crisp with light carbonation. The brett leaves a strong impression on the mouthfeel at this age. Quite dry, but good.  Drinkability is quite good. I love the 3F funk in this bottle and the citrus compliments it well. However, I'm left wondering what a more recent vintage series tastes like. I think if the brett were a little less dominating, then this would be almost perfect. Overall, this is a great offering from 3F and the nose is unreal. Definitely worth seeking out.",0.6845123320901698,4.5,0.9955
Flora - Blueberry,"Alright, fine, I'll give it the first review.   Poured into the HF tulip. Dark purple. No head, some froth around the rim. Pretty dark even when held up to the light. It's a great looking beer.  Smell is incredible. I love it. Tart blueberries, funk, and oak. It's really juicy. I can only describe it as a ""heavy"" smell, but I might not even know what that means, but I like it. Maybe I've just been smelling it for too long but I'm starting to pick up cherries, plum, grape and green apple. Reminds me slightly of a Cantillon kriek I drank recently, but with more fruit.  The taste starts off with blueberries right up front, fading off to a funky end, with some lemon, as well. The aftertaste is reminiscent of grape cough syrup, but way better with added funk and tartness. Its a mellow tartness. The taste isn't as juicy as the smell, the blueberry is more of a great compliment to the base beer and meshes well with everything else. Can definitely pick up the wine barrels, too, probably where that delicious grape cough syrup is coming from. It's more pleasant than I make the aftertaste sound. I promise.   Medium carbonation with mouthfeel on the thinner side. You get that initial burst of bubbles on the front end, and fades out slowly, leaving the blueberry tartness laying on the tongue. Well, this is pretty delicious beer. There's not too much I can say against it.",0.6568012033765817,4.75,0.9955
Oude Geuze Vintage,"2006 vintage.  Beer is yellow and mostly clear until the bottom. Its effervescent. White head of medium and small bubbles that doesn't leave much lacing on the glass or hang out very long. Looks good.  ""This beer smells like a nun's crotch"" - Lunch (he meant it as a good thing)  Aroma is nice and bright with acetic sourness, mild citrus fruit bitterness and some mild lactic notes. There isn't much oak in here, perhaps with age it would get better. I am loving the mild funk on the back end of the aroma though. Its complex, poster child for a great smelling gueuze.   Beer is light and has a lot of carbon in the mouth. Its tart and sour but leads with the sour palate and the tartness is minimal. The acetic is winning I feel in here with a healthy brettish funk on the back end. There is a strong citric character as well. Its semi-fruity if that makes sense. I love the palate connectivity of this gueuze, I wonder what this would be like in 10 years. Its complex and simple simultaneously and I love this beer. Some were underwhelmed by it but its close to perfect as a gueuze can be IMO. I love this beer.",0.6905036171935411,5.0,0.9955
Lou Pepe - Framboise," bottle, 2010 sticker. Purchased at Brasserie Cantillon for on-site consumption, 11€. Poured out of a lambic basket into Cantillon stemmed wine glasses, 7/5/2013. Drank this one after drinking a 2010 Lou Pepe Kriek.  Pours a lovely red-pink body, with a nice fluffy 2cm pink head with good retention. Not a ton of lacing to be seen. The colour on this is very similar to that of the Lou Pepe Kriek. I love how fruity and glowing these beers' colours look.  Smells like straight up fresh raspberries with a ton of that musty Cantillon brewery funk and hay, accompanied by a nice dose of vinegar acidity. Although, like the other beers I'm drinking on premises, I can't promise that its because I'm drinking it at the actual brewery which smells like that. Its a great combination regardless.   Drinking this beer yields a crapload of raspberry fruit flavour along with a strong, delicious acetic sourness that has some oak barrel components. In the background is some earthy funk, leather and horseblanket. But the raspberries are definitely not missed here, and the acetic sourness is just perfect. Unlike the Rosé de Gambrinus, this big brother version is more complex with more of that earthiness in the background with a more complex acetic sour flavour.  Fizzly, great carbonation, actually a bit thinner bodied compared to Lou Pepe Kriek. So easy to drink, and I was able to down most of this bottle on my own. No hints of alcohol which is no surprise.  I really enjoyed this one. This is beyond better than Rosé, as it is more complex while being more fruity and brings out the other flavours of the brewing process very well. Still, raspberries don't provide as much complexity as the cherries do in the corresponding Krieks. I prefer Lou Pepe Kriek to this, but this is still an absolute delight to drink.",0.659343616571035,4.75,0.9955
Chocolate Rain,"75cl bottle, vintage 2012. Generously shared by lunarbrew at a crazy bottleshare last night, 10/5/2013. Poured into a Zwanze 2013 glass.  Review #225.  Looks like Black Tuesday. Pours motor oil and looks like liquid chocolate, like fondue. Opaque, black and chewy. Even came out with a 1cm mocha head that had fairly good retention. Not much lacing. Looks like freakin' dessert.  Heavenly is what I'd call the smell. We had just drank 2011 Black Tuesday before opening up this one, and it smells even better than BT. The massive sweetness of the base BT is tempered a bit by cocoa bitterness and raw vanilla, which is perfect. It's intense and over the top, which is the Bruery for you.  I love how this beer tastes. The sweetness is pretty much a straight up caramel-molasses-sugar bomb. So intensely sweet, but not overly so because of the bigness of the vanilla essence and the bitterness of the cocoa nibs. A good bit of barrel contribution, giving us some sweet bourbon and some oak.  Mouthfeel is BT plus. Medium bodied, basically liquid dessert, much like Bourbon County Stout. Carbonation is low which is expected here. Best thing about it is that there is no booziness whatsoever in this 19.5% beer. Dang! Finish is complex as hell with a nice resinous quality to it. Not too sticky, not too dry. Its great.  This is an awesome imperial stout. Much better than Black Tuesday for sure.. the adjuncts do a great job of taming down BT's ridiculous sugar bomb aspect, and there is no heat in this. None at all. This is a treat, but I would agree that you have to open this bottle with 4-5 other people to be able to fully enjoy this.",0.6618376357478399,4.75,0.9954
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"12oz bottle, dated 05.04.16, stamped 13.0% ABV, poured into a Bell's tulip glass.  The beer pours an extremely deep, jet black color, a touch of cola brown hues when struck by the light with a tight khaki head, nearly a finger high that has low retention but does yield some soapy lace. The aroma is huge, intense chocolate, bittersweet with strong oak, light bourbon, a touch of stone fruits, some vanilla and strong malted barley. The chocolate character on the nose is great, the alcohol presence starts to creep out as it warms, but this is more oaky, and tame and it opens up some nice complex aromas that make it one of the better smelling barrel aged stouts I've encountered in a while. The flavors are pretty harsh, really big barrel character right off the bat, chewy oak, light toffee forward bourbon, bittersweet chocolate, roasted barley, a touch of coffee flavor, vanilla, stone fruits, caramel and alcohol round out a pretty complex beer, but as it warms, the alcohol gets very sharp and this beer gets a bit more roasty and oaky at the same time, which is an odd flavor combination, and leaves a very earthy flavor on my tongue that lingers almost indefinitely. The mouthfeel is very nice, thick and chewy, mildly prickly carbonation props this beer up but it coats the mouth so well, very sticky with a finish that is very warm and almost dry.   Verdict: A nice barrel aged stout from Bell's. I can easily say that I prefer the base beer, it's a bit more complex and nuanced, the barrel treatment here kind of flattens this beer and it's so barrel forward that it becomes a bit too harsh. That being said, the huge chocolate aroma on this beer is so inviting and enjoyable that it really makes up for that big barrel flavor.",0.6998888195106006,3.75,0.9954
Beer:Barrel:Time,"It poured a super thick and viscous in the glass, pitch black color with very little head. Very little carbonation. The smell is sweet with tons of fudge interlace with bourbon and oak. Not complex by any means but so balance, sweet and rich. The flavor profile is just the same - so much rich chocolate fudge in the mouth balanced out with the warming touch of bourbon. Its sweet with a lot of depth that includes dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, and bourbon; all the things you would dream of in a barrel aged stout. The mouthfeel is thick and rich without much warmth for a 15% ABV beer. Overall: this is a superb beer, well remarkable for its balance of flavors, its depth of flavors and the thickness. Some may say its overrated because its not too different from other easy to obtain stouts. I have to disagree, it is well perfected with its sweetness, balance and the bourbon.",0.7179023636143038,4.75,0.9954
Very GGGreennn,"Picked up a 4 pack of this at the brewery on release.   A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice super hazy golden hue hue with a dense, creamy two finger white that fades to leave very sticky lacing and a rather thick blanket. Each sip reveals a layer of lacing.  S - Aromas of bright tropical pineapple creamsicle notes as well as slightly bitter citrus peel and juice. Little doughy, earthy, melon forward, quite juicy with flashes of almost strawberry like sweetness.  T - Taste is similar to the nose with super juicy tangerine and grapefruit. Citrus bomb along with almost thick and heavy pineapple. Loads of earthy and melon notes, the doughy notes are more subdued. Good pine without getting bitter. There is an almost inherent fruit candy sweetness going on in the background. Lingering grapefruit and pineapple jam on the finish. Hardly any bitterness whatsoever. There a little bit of lingering dried kiwi well after taking a sip. No discernible alcohol on the finish but there is a bit of warmth.  M - Mouthfeel is very lightly carbonated, body is thick and lush almost velvety. It more than makes up for the lower carbonation by having such a luscious body.  O - Overall this beer is damn near perfection. The appearance and mouthfeel are just spot on and the fruity hop notes on the nose and taste are simply excellent; I suppose there could be a bit stronger pineapple notes but it really becomes splitting hairs between a 4.75 and a 5 considering the hops used in this beer. People seem to constantly profess ""Monson was better"" now-a-days with some reviewers even touching on how this beer reminds them of the 'quality' that was brewed at their previous location. That is all fine and good, albeit a cheap excuse for people to bash because it's so cool to do so, but this beer...this beer reminds me of Brimfield. Before Monson and all the mules and new money looking to flip beer for a quick buck. I take a sip of this beer and I'm transported back to the days of sitting in the back keg room with Nate, Dean, Johnny, and Jared sampling beers. Back to the record player and the jeering when someone put on a terrible record, barrel of peanuts in shell, after hour parties, and magnetic dart board attached to the barn door. Nate and Dean dueling guitars, Lauren smiling no matter how large the line got, and that damn tipping bell...how Dean kept his voice I'll never know. The tears in all their eyes as people professed how good the beers were and twinkle as they perhaps realized that this dream was becoming a reality. This beer is all that Tree House was and all they are now. Congratulations Nate and crew to all you have accomplished. Happy Anniversary.  Serving Type: Can",0.6589567513956879,5.0,0.9954
Double Orange Starfish,"i was so stoked to try this after hearing and reading an awful lot about it, and maybe it didnt travel well to colorado, but i was somewhat unimpressed by this when i had it at hops and pie this week, its a tasty beer, a cool expression of the hops, sturdy and fresh and goof, but it really didnt stand out to me as overly high quality or anything. its rusty orange tinted without a ton of head and a hazy density to it, mucky even. the aroma might be the best part, cut tangerine and orange zest, heavier citra than we usually get, subtle apricot and peach, layered and interesting for a couple of hops i know pretty well. the flavor is good too, starting better than it ends though, fruity and bright up front, plenty of orange character, orange candy, lemongrass, and a little grain sweetness, this is a little bigger than it needs to be right away for me, like i would love to try the original instead of the double, it seems just a little forced. right past the delicious apex of this, it turns green and chemical, over hopped, bitey, less refined than the best of these are by a long shot, and i have no idea if its an age thing, a flaw, or something from transit, but it really makes this pretty hard to drink and seems a shame after such an enjoyable experience up until here. past the saturation point and then a bit bitter as a result, broken down and muddled compared to earlier on, and by the end of a glass, i dont want any more at all, and i am left thinking this isnt any better than anything we have locally here in the same style, and when i think about the ones i have loved from the likes of outer range, trve, and cerebral, i realize this isnt really worth the attention it seems to have gotten. cool that it came through here, but ill need to try it closer to the source i think to get a better feel for it...",0.6369987559524769,4.0,0.9954

Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Thanks to ms11781 for this bottle of the 2008 vintage. Split four ways. Reviewed on 9/9/2011 and posted here from notes taken that night.  The color is a beautiful deep ruby red that almost glows when held up to the light. As is the case with many of Armand's lambics, there is no head, but there is plenty of lively carbonation to make up for it.  The aroma is light and bright, full of fresh cherries, a very clean lemony lactin sourness, and some mineraly goodness that I really enjoy from 3F offerings. On the palate, there are lots of sweet cherries, and they take center stage. The lactic lemony notes blend with a gnarly sweaty gym sock, wet hay, and dank funkiness.  Lively and bright, this is an awesome kriek, though I find that the other notes that I am enjoying are prying my focus from the delicious cherries. That, combined with the price tag, makes this not quite equal to Cantillon's Kriek lambic in my book.",0.6860840551676278,4.0,0.9954
Enjoy By IPA,"Bottled on 3/14/17, enjoyed on 4/6/17. Bottled on 9/24, enjoyed on 10/27.  L: Beautiful amber color poured to YETI, medium sized white foamy head, good retention, solid lacing.  S: BIG HOPS! Bold and sharp aroma, fruity hops, grapefruit, herbal, mellow mango, very nice! Dank. Booze. Winner.  T: In my opinion, this is Stone's gold standard for DIPA. Flavorful, bold, strong, thick, exciting, fruity, dank, hop forward, pleasingly rich, lightly bitter pine finish, malt is just right. Bottle says ""Devastatingly Dank"", I agree. EJB 10/31/17 bottle says ""Devastatingly Fresh"", also agree.  F: Chewy liquid, medium to full bodied, resinous. Not too boozy for a 9.4 abv. O: This is a big beer. Very unique and awesome, every sip an experience and keeps getting better throughout the session; one of those beers that you never want to end. I like the Tangerine version a little better, wish they would've made a batch this year... Also shared one of these with a friend; his first ever DIPA, and he really liked it; he didn't realize a beer could smell and taste like this... World class.

Todd The Axe Man,"Right off the bat, this IPA is very malty. It feels like taking a step back in time. I'm from New England. This is like the IPAs that were being made before NE was trying to replicate the west coast style. So if you're expecting a nice Citra Mosaic IPA like I was you might want to move along.  Look: Nice head. This IPA is a little darker than most coming out these days. There's a slight haze but you can read through it around the edges.  Aroma: First thing I notice is how bready it is. There's a sharpness to it with some mango like flavors but I would hesitate to say that it smells fruity. It almost smells woody. Malt dominates the nose in this beer.  Taste: Definitely pour this in a glass. I drank the first half out of the can and it just tasted like bitter malt. It was very similar to older IPAs being brewed in New England back in the early to mid 2000s. There are hops in this beer but I feel like they are obscured by the malt. There's no balance. The bready sweetness of the malt is a completely different flavor than what the hops can deliver. It finishes kinda sticky and sweet which I don't really like.  Mouth Feel: I have no issues on the mouth feel. It has a nice medium low thickness and good carbonation. Appropriate for the style.  Overall: I really don't get why this beer is so highly rated. I really don't like this beer. If I wanted a malty beer, I would rather drink an english old ale or something more interesting. The hops don't blend well with the flavor of the malt. They seem like an afterthought. The further into this beer the more I liked it but it never hit the threshold of me actually liking this beer. I like all sorts of IPAs. One thing on my journey of IPA drinking that I've picked up is keep the malt in the background. The different flavors you can get out of hops are crazy diverse and that is what I'm interested in with an IPA. Some IPAs ride the line of maltiness and a lot of them (I'm looking at Lagunitas) somehow pull of a malt sweetness that perfectly fits in with the hop profile. This beer totally missed the mark for me. It's crazy to me how this is rated as the top American IPA on this website. Makes me wonder if I'm drinking the same beer as everybody else. The date on the can is only a month old. This should be better than it is.",0.6433980138384874,2.25,0.9954
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2010 vintage served in a Cantillon lambic glass  Appearance: Pours a bright ruby red with hints of purple. Less than a finger of a light pink head dissipates quickly to a collar. Body is somewhat clear with light visible carbonation streaming throughout the glass.  Smell: Huge fresh raspberries, oak, hay, barnyard funk, green apple, vinegar acidity. Light musty character present as well and intensifies as the beer warms, but probably still a little lighter than a typical Cantillon.  Taste: Tart juicy raspberries, basement, oak tannins. Hugely tart, almost mouth puckering, tart finish.   Mouthfeel: Light bodied, with low/medium levels of spritzy carbonation. Super smooth and drinkable. Nearly perfect.  Overall: Not surprisingly, this is another winner from Cantillon. Huge fresh, jammy raspberry with tartness and funk that are strong enough to add additional complexity without overwhelming the fruit character. Best raspberry lambic, and possibly best fruit lambic of any kind that I've had. Definitely worth seeking out.",0.7119406790554929,4.5,0.9953

Has a nice amount of sweetness, but still has a great backbone of backers chocolate to balance it out. The barrel treatment is perfect as it is present but doesn't overshadow anything else. Feel: Super thick and lingers for a while. Can't imagine this being done much better. Overall: One of the best stouts that I have ever had.

Chocolate Rain,"750ml bottle gently poured to the rim of a CBS snifter. Proper pour is proper.  A - Pours a deep rich black with very little head that recedes quickly. This beer leaves serious lacing. It warns that doming it may not be the greatest idea, but it's a challenge to accept.  S - Sweet vanilla mixed with bourbon. Strong burnt sugar alcohol smell. Like a decadent dessert. Smells like I may not be able to walk when this is over.  T - This my friends, is a freaking Beer. Up front you walk right into bourbon soaked coconut which fades out into some bittering chocolate and leaves with sweet vanilla and molasses. This is a beer to be sipped and savored. Delicious. There's something wrong with you if you didn't lick your lips after a sip.   M - Big syrupy beer with definite warming alcohol presence. I'm glad I have another saved for winter. Low carbonation, which is preferred in this style.   O - This is a wonderful beer. It may be too sweet for some, but I freakin' love it. It's just a notch behind Black Tuesday overall, but a wonderful change of pace.   Now to prepare for my hangover tomorrow...",0.6124812655813658,4.75,0.9953
Green,"Okay, now this is a tasty IPA but a bit odd as it's got a lot tropical notes but they pair better with the hops than the Julius does. This was kegged on September, 27, 2016.  The color is hazy goldenrod with a nice yellowish white head that has great retention and lacing.  The nose is that of orange, pineapple and a floral bouquet. Citrus heavy, though and smelling like you about drink Sunny-D. Very interesting nose It could use more character in the floral hop arena in my opinion but a nice nose nonetheless.  Well balanced flavor however, like the nose, still not traditional. The citrus fruit is strong but is equaled by the hope character giving it a strong grapefruit flavor. Orange and pineapple at the start but a strong grapefruit finish. Slight hints of pine.  Mouthfeel is perfect for this style. The right balance of body and carbonation. The body is Light-Medium with crisp carbonation making it a very drinkable IPA.  Overall, I would drink this beer... when I'm in a tropical mood.",0.719832042470095,4.75,0.9953
Darkstar November,"2016 bottle poured into snifter 13.8%ABV  This is my first venture into the BL realm and I've gotta say that I'm impressed. More so in the fact that that a brewery that has so much hype surrounding it can back it up with one of their non-hyped brews.   Pours very dark brown with a small tuft of deerskin colored foam. The nose really explodes off of the glass as I'm pouring. Molasses for sure, but with another big sweetness to it. Almost like slightly burned brownies. The taste has the same sort of thing going on. Super fudge flavor with a bit of charred mallow. Not sure what type of barrel was used here, but the barrel flavors themselves are a supreme compliment to the base beer(whatever it is). Sweetness is the major player here, but the slightest bit of an alcohol burn backs it up and quickly fades, leaving no trace behind except a tiny bit of warmth on your tongue. I've never actually described a mouthfeel as ""oily"" before, but it fits here. Heavy and slick. The perfect amount of carbonation lightens the load and helps tremendously. I love most everything about this beer. Very well crafted.",0.647426848841428,4.75,0.9953
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"750ml bottle of the 2012 Bourbon Barrel-Aged Dark Lord, bottle number 75/688. Thanks Adam for trading me this delicious beer. Poured into a Three Floyds teku glass today, 3/22/2014 as part of our celebratory whale tasting that's celebrating success and prolonged friendships. Cheers guys!  No better beer to meet the milestone of beer #800 and review #500!  App- Pitch black body, similar to the base Dark Lord, minimal half-finger mocha head with very good retention, not much lacing.  Smell- Holy moly! Lots of sweet brown sugar, vanilla (from the barrel), port sweetness, milk chocolate, charred malts, roast body, even a bit of coffee. This is a beautiful smelling, very complex nose that is about 90% of what Murda'd Out smells like. So decadent smelling. It's almost as good smelling as BVDL, though I really enjoyed the even more marshmallow bourbon-forward nature of BVDL.  Flavour- Falls a little bit short of the nose, very very diabeetus sweet like the base Dark Lord, yet complemented with a nice sweet bourbon flavour, some strong oak vanilla (which comes about a quarter of the way to replicating BVDL's vanilla bomb), charred malts, brown sugar, molasses, dark fruits. This is a very complex beer here, and you have to take your time drinking this to savor all the nuances of this beer. Basically, this is a Dark Lord beer with a nice barrel vanilla contribution with a splash of bourbon. This was very good, but I expected more bourbon presence.  Mouthfeel- Thick bodied, creamy, just the right carbonation, so sweet yet so drinkable. I could have domed this beer. Zero ABV heat.  Overall- Very enjoyable tasting experience. A lot of complexity despite its sugary sweetness. I do think the bourbon would have been more present had this been drank at a younger age. As with the contrasting experiences between '12 and '13 BVDL, it's clear that any bourbon-barrel aged Dark Lord beers should be drank fresher. Regardless, I really enjoyed this beer!",0.6582765733341245,4.25,0.9952

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Lou Pepe Framboise. 2009 vintage. Bottle acquired at a bar in Chicago and served into a flute. Reviewed from notes taken on St. Patrick's Day standing up in a crowded bar, so bear with me. Expectations were sky high given the brewery's reputation and my love for sours.   A: Pours a one finger head of pnk colour. Fair cream and thickness. Retention is average (~3+ minutes). Body is a vibrant understated rich red. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show.   Sm: Tart raspberry. Acidic fruit skin. Bacteria/wild yeast. A mild strength aroma. Clean and tart, with surprisingly mild sourness.   T: Tart sourness. Lactic. Fantastic tart raspberry fruit. Clean unobtrusive malt foundation. Crystal malt lends a champagne like note. Balance is perfect. It's a simple sour, but a good one. Contained tart lactic sourness. Not real puckerworthy, but damn tasty. Great subtlety. Really good.   Mf: Clan, smooth, and wet. Perfect carbonation. Crisp. Near perfect. Feels custom-tailored to the flavour profile. Tart and bubbly/fizzy from the crystal malt.   Dr: Quite drinkable. Hides ABV well. It's exactly what you want in a sour. Incredibly tasty and enjoyable. Damn good for the style, but I wouldn't trade for it. Best purchased for cheap in Belgium; it's overpriced here. Glad I got to try it for a special occasion; it wouldn't be worth the pricetag elsewise.   High A-",0.7083677241463497,4.5,0.9952
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Dont know why i decided to crack this tonight out of all nights but just felt like it for some reason its a 750ml corked/capped/caged bottle that states it is 2006 vintage,it pours a beautiful cherry,rose hue with nice carbonation that leaves a fast vanishing one finger head and little lacing,the aroma is so strong and pungent its not funny with sweet cherries,raspberries,strawberries and hay all on display in the aroma very nice i like it,and on taste its alot the same which starts out with a spritzy/mineral water mouthfeel which is beautifully suited to the style with tastes of ripe raspberries and cherries and it finishes with a very sour mouthpuckering feel to be expected and to be quite honest i like it i mean im gonna easily finish this bottle but if i had another bottle i wouldnt crack it tonight,overall a beautiful example of the style that i respect and i think really highlights the raspberry qualities perfectly.",0.6643860060295541,3.5,0.9952
Todd The Axe Man,"Wow, I had no idea this was in the top 250 beers of all time... really? And, let's see here... the top American IPA on BA?! Huh. Well then. I picked up a can of this, my first ever Surly offering (though I had the Amagher/Surly collaborative version of this at Lord Hobo for Zwanze Day like five years ago or so, if I recall correctly), at my local Craft Beer Cellar just yesterday afternoon, which I found weird. Maybe that means we'll get more Surly soon. I've kinda always wanted to have a glass of Furious, so I hope that happens.  Anyway, this is a Citra/Mosaic DDH IPA that borders on (but doesn't quite become) a double IPA, and it has a lot to live up to based on those reviews down below mine. Pours a deep golden color, almost like a medium-amber honestly. Remember IPAs looking like this? Yeah, I know, I barely do either. The head is decently foamy, measuring about two-fingers of slightly-off-white suds that lace pretty nicely. Good legs and structure to the head here, for sure, and I can see a lot of carbonation rising from the bottom of my glass, which is always a good sign. I think this is a tad darker in color than the current trends, but the recipe is very 2014, so kudos to them for sticking to their guns.  Even though this was only canned 5 weeks ago (just hit my distribution area, so it's not like I've been sitting on this review or whatever), it smells kind of... old? Sure, there are the requisite tangerine, papaya, pine resin, and grassy notes that every decent Citra/Mosaic IPA should boast, but it just doesn't have a lot of vivacity to it. Some light tannins and crisp biscuity malt come out too... almost has an English IPA bent to it for whatever reason?  The flavor profile is, once again, a bit malty and stiff, though with some good grassiness and citrus pith. However, it just feels kinda stale and been-there-done-that. There's no excitement to be had here! This was great when I had it on that Zwanze Day when it was a new beer, as I recall, but this doesn't do much for me nowadays. Feel is pretty good; medium-bodied and well-carbonated with a nice biting bitterness toward the finish and a smooth, massaging mid-palate. Anyway, I don't know if it's the recipe that's changed, or if this really falls off after only a few weeks, or what, but... yeah, I'm not loving it. Definitely not the top ""American IPA,"" and it would honestly be nowhere near my top 100 if I bothered to assemble such an exhaustive list.",0.6311428761006024,3.75,0.9952
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Bell's has always impressed. Thank you Joe for this wonderful gift.  The barrel aged version of this famous stout is pitch black. So clean and dark it is void of all else. The smooth as glass surface gains intensity with the lack of foam, though the faintest ring of browned bubbles do hug the coast.  Let's get the obvious out of the way, this is boozy. The elements around this booze are incredible. Semi sweet chocolate chips cooked down for a drizzle over something decadent.  The first smoke of a freshly lit fire, the wood with some remnant dampness. Raisins and boysenberry jam fruitiness. Brown sugar, molasses, and moist chewing tobacco.  I have to skip the flavor for a second to talk about this texture. It is simply magnificent. Bordering chocolate syrup viscosity with the smoothest and creamiest cruise control over the tongue. It coats relentlessly. The boozy warmth just right, and the barrel influence does not dry it out like so many other bourbon barrel aged beers do. This texture is one of a kind. It leans on the sweet side as expected, but a roasty finish rounds it out just right.  Alright, back to the flavor. Chocolate Roulade in a glass. The berry and dark cherry like flavors along with creamy milk chocolate. Wow. A little bourbon to soak that cake, and a touch of smokey wood and black licorice. This thing is full flavored and then some.  There's something to say about these breweries that have been at it for the long haul. They make great beer. Barrel aging is an art that many can't pull off. This one is about as good as it gets. I couldn't tell you if this would benefit with age or not because it's so fucking good right now as is.  Cheers, and thanks again Joe!",0.6450781097227067,4.75,0.9952
Black Tuesday,"BT2012...poured in to a Bruery snifter.   A - Black Tuesday pours that heady black sexy you anticipated, with a decent deep mocha head that makes you drool ever-so-slightly.  S - Smell-wise, I get booze-soaked chocolate coconut cookie...wait, someone make that in food form, I need to get my Wilfred Brimley on. But yeah, booze, sugars, a pinch of coffee, bourbon deliciousness.  T - So, there's actually a healthy amount of diversity going on here. Beyond that bourbon carry-over from the shnozz, the myriad of heady sweetness is outstanding: chocolate, vanilla, coconut, toffee, chocolate-cherry, butter, and vanilla-cocoa...I dunno...it's the tits.  M - I honestly think this tastes no where near 19.2...I mean, I dig the heat components, and it's certainly sweet, but it's also incredibly drinkable for all that's going on here; it's a bit 'coating' and most definitely a sipper. It's also delicious and way too easy to drink.   O - I can't say I was let down here in any capacity. In fact, this beer exceeded my expectations. It betters as it warms a bit, with sweet, potent complexity assuming the best of everything within this bottle with a coat of beer-sexy on your tongue. Giddy-up.",0.6298085297147494,5.0,0.9952
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Bottle opened on 10/12/2014 graciously by @Hey5hitgoose. 2014 Vintage  Pours absolutely pitch black with a 1/4"" dark chocolate colored head that dissipates relatively quickly. It was hard to pay attention to the head when the beer itself is so amazingly oily and viscous looking.  The nose is dark roasted coffee and sweet maple syrup, and then of course the bourbon. Each smell is distinct and seems absolutely perfect, with none over powering each other but working together in hamony.  Maple, Chocolate, coffee, vanilla are all present unify perfectly. The amount of maple in each sip is incredible, and the coffee adds a nice touch. The bourbon is absolutely perfect, not incredibly overpowering, but strong and present.   The oily sludge coats the glass and the mouth, but is not cloying, rather makes you just want to continue sipping as the flavors start to fade away.   Overall I guess I wish this beer wasn't so incredible considering the insane amount of effort it takes to obtain one (unless of course you live in Decorah). Alas, it was truly one of those beers that I am glad to say that I have had the opportunity to try and will certainly look forward to having it again, despite how long it may take for that to happen. Certainly worth breaking out a rating of 5 due to how amazingly well crafted this beer is. I have only had a couple of other BA stouts that are even in the same league. I certainly hope TG can start making this in larger batches in years to come.",0.6419592216024029,5.0,0.9951
Sip Of Sunshine,"How does one segue seamlessly from The Eradication/Reduction of The Bottle Backlog at Chez Woody back into what really matters, namely, The CANQuest (tm)? Well, first, you have to jump into Mr. Peabody & Sherman's W.A.B.A.C. Machine, going back to the early-to-mid-1970's. There, a youthful Bro. Woody spent a LOT of time on his maternal grandparents' property, abutting a working farm. A young neighbor girl traded comic books & played tetherball with me. She grew up, married a fellow local beer aficionado & during a recent road trip to VT, they knew to bring me CANs! Viva The CANQuest (tm)! It pays to advertise.   From the CAN: ""Lawson’s Finest Liquids is a small artisanal brewery located in Warren, Vermont, producing an array of hop-forward ales, specialty maple beers and unique creations. Sip of Sunshine IPA is brewed by Lawson’s Finest Liquids at Two Roads Brewing Co. in Stratford CT. Lean more by visiting lawsonsfinest.com.""; ""This lupulin-ladin India Pale Ale is packed with juicy tropical fruit character, bright floral aromas, and delectable layers of hop flavor. Pour mindfully, inhale deeply, and enjoy a tropical vacation in a glass. Always store cold, enjoy fresh and stay cool!""; ""Keep Cold! Enjoy Fresh!""   A mindful pour? What does that involve? The mindfulness of the local giving my friend a hard time because the beer is brewed & CANned at Two Roads? Snobbery at its finest.  I listened to the joyful Crack! as I opened the CAN & after mindful CANsideration, I employed a very gentle Glug. I hearkened to the angelic singing of cherubs as I filled my glass with this elusive elixir. I began to employ an in-glass swirl, but there was no need - its fecund effervescence raised a finger of dense, foamy, bone-white head with excellent retention of its own accord. Color was Golden-Amber (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-quality clarity & of course, The Gelt Gang of Mammon, Midas & Croesus showed up for a taste. I think that the whole neighborhood might have shown up if they had known what I was drinking today! I inhaled deeply and realized that the nose was very fruity, very tropical, but in this case, rather than putting me in mind of Tropical Fruit Life Savers, I was reminded more of JuicyFruit gum. Mmm. Mouthfeel was big & thick, like a dollop on my tongue and in my mouth. I just let it loll about, rolling it back and forth as I savored my tropical staycation. The taste was bright and clean, tropical fruity initially, followed by a blast of grapefruit citrusiness. It had a bitterness, to be sure, but not like some that I have imbibed recently in which the dry hopping was a bit too close to saturation. This managed to strike that fine balance between allowing the hops to Shine while still creating a high-ABV beer through the use of additional malts, which CAN likewise increase the sweetness. I noticed that as it warmed, the tropical fruit flavors really returned with a vengeance, pushing the pushy grapefruit citrusiness out of the way. Finish was dry, but not gaspingly so. I do not know when, if ever, I will have this again, so I took my time with it, savoring every Sip of this liquid Sunshine.",0.6457502693762266,4.5,0.9951
Beer:Barrel:Time,"its amazing to have a stout this rich and complex and decadent without any adjuncts, a defiant statement here to the countless triple coconut belgian chocolate chili pepper cinnamon vanilla bean whatevers out there, nothing to hide here, no need for extras. i know this is the base for all the coffee variants, and after having this i really want to try some of them, but there is no need for coffee here, there is no need for anything. at a certain size threshold, and 15% abv certainly qualifies, something happens in big stouts like this where they either become exposed and sloppy and kitchen sinky and off putting, or they become the stuff of legend. this is without a doubt in the latter camp, one of the smoothest, richest, and most complete barrel aged stouts out there right now. the barrels are obviously special, but thats not what makes the beer for me, as much as the old oak and the mature whiskey are fine compliments to this. what makes it for me is the layers of grain and the overall density of this. it seriously has the consistency of brownie batter, and what the pale malts, sweeter crustal types, and starchy oats add to the dark roasty barley is special, displays elite level understanding, and makes this memorable from a quality standpoint. i love the slick heavy feel, motor oil going down, heavy roast already with some coffee character, but drenched in quality bourbon and vanilla, brown sugar, and molasses. i like this warm, and i like the warming alcohol that slowly drifts up front it. chewy feeling but still carbonated. absolutely expert beer, i hope to get to try the coffee editions, but this is special as it is. a new high bar for barrel aged stout!",0.6706742734901822,4.5,0.9951
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"From a 750 ml bottle to a tulip.   A-A normal pour produces very little head; just a thin pink cap that fades quickly to a collar. The beer is raspberry in color and slightly cloudy. Nothing spectacular to look at, but it suits the style.  S-The aroma on this older (2011) bottle is subdued compared to some lambics, but I still smell a good bit of sour cherry. Other scents include champagne, cider vinegar, and a light dose of earthy, barnyard funk. Acidity is moderate to low for the style.  T-The taste is flush with clean acidity, as well as some mostly-dry oaky funk, and more of that lovely sweet/sour cherry taste. It is very balanced and impresses with its focus rather than outright sourness or fruit flavors.  M-The feel is slightly heavier than some lambic style beers with an assertive but smooth carbonation that really compliments the flavor. Perhaps the best ""feeling"" lambic I have ever had.  O-What a great beer. It sounds stupid, but the smell and flavor are so simple and clean that the beer almost becomes more complex as I try to locate all the little subtle aromas and nuances that make this beer taste so good. Unlike some true Belgian lambics, I found this beer to be approachable, as well, i.e., not hugely sour or funky or hard to appreciate. The mouthfeel is also nearly perfect for the style.",0.7148379398263969,5.0,0.9951
Sang Noir,"750mL corked and caged bottle poured into a snifter. Thanks for the bottle Jason!  (A)- Pours a deep deep burgundy red color with slight purple plum edges. Some good white froth formed but dissipated quickly.  (S)- Very ripe and vibrant acidic oak with ripe berry-like fruits. Quite jam-like with cherry, berries, and cassis fruits with some very subtle vanilla graham cracker oak on the finish as it opens up.  (T)- Quite the sour bomb! Very sour and acidic oak dryness but is balanced out very well with some serious jam-like dark fruits: blackberry, boysenberry, cherry, and cassis.  (M)- A great carbonation level amidst a very hefty sourness level. I love how juicy the fruits get in this with in combination with the nice presence of the dry oak really makes this so enjoyable.  (O)- A superb showing of what fruit, oak, and sourness can do together when blended expertly. So very sour, but so very good and welcomed with the incoming of warmer weather. Very easily my favorite Cascade to date!",0.6919505151714218,4.75,0.9951
Vicinity,"Bottled 4/29/16  Pours a mild fizzy fluffy almost 1 finger head that fades at a med pace, decent soapy lacing, super murky hazy milk-shake golden honey orange color.  Nose explodes with juicy hops, even during the pour, great fruity tropical notes, a little pineapple with juicy mild musty citrus, a faint passion fruit and guava perhaps, bright orange juice tangerine, a faint grapefruit, more citrus tropical characters like a hand of Buddha or something like that, maybe lychee, but not really sure what to call it. Also a touch of malt.  Taste brings more Galaxy and tropical fruits, citrus all over as well, big tangerine and orange juice, citrus flesh, a little pith, big tropical notes, generic musty tropical, a little passion fruit and pineapple, juicy almost white peach like fruit as well, it has that character like I just bit into an overripe peach/tangerine/pineapple/clementine homogenized thing and the juice explodes, also a little flesh of papaya (that mild squishy tropical version of watermelon thing). A little toasted creamy malt base, maybe a touch cracker malt, not sweet at all and no real booze. The hops start to turn a bit spicy on the back end, more grapefruit rind, a little melon rind as well, orange peel, spicy chewy hops too, especially on the dry finish, and a touch of booze wafting out late.  mouth is med bod, a little soft creamy feel, decent carb, no booze.  Overall, well let's just say that I'm finally turning my views on Trillium around. Initially I thought their beers were good, but not great. Lately I've been having more of them and I feel they have really stepped up their game and are starting to become a contender with Tree House for best brewery in MA (who are second only to Hill Farmstead in the U.S.) . Trillium makes some great beers now, although they also make meh ones as well, but still maybe a level below Tree House, but working their way up there. So glad to have some incredible breweries like this in MA.",0.6435462943794149,4.5,0.995
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"22 ounce Bomber into a Wine Glass.  Let's get it under way, I've got the Purple Waxed Fifty/Fifity. I might have to review this brew every season. For this year's tasting let's describe it for the masses. First things first, how did she pour? This year she poured just as exceptional as every year. Nice Dark Black sexy body with a deep Mocha Wig. She is looking Beautiful tonight!   How does she smell? First waves of subtle dark fruits..(light oxidation). Second waves of chocolate covered Almonds. It's deep with the fragrance, yet not holding attention. Light char with notes of malt sweetness. She's aight to the nose!   Ahh! The flavor! This thing hits you harder than some MTX 1200 Watt Subwoofers in a GMC Sonoma playing Frank Sinatra. She hits hard but in a classy way. The first initial flavor is, of course, Honey Sweetness that anchors notes of Chocolate. Second flavor brings that Almond aroma to life. It's that rich toasted almond flavor that I dig in Elijah Craig Bourbon. Third wave of flavors come in with toasted grains and slight Barrel Char. This finishes Sweet, Dry and Boozy with bitterness hitting the palate at full force. The aftertaste though is Banging! Sweet Chocolate covered Almonds with a tight Char note. It's a great aftertaste. The feel is upper tier but not saying anything to add to the brew's greatness. It's feel is Medium-light with so-so carbonation.   Overall: I keep it humble, IMO this brew is worth the coin. It is classy with the right amounts of Roasted Malts, sweetness and Barrel Notes that are not so agressive that you feel like you just got Bourbon Raped! The flavors on point and are to my liking. The only thing I cannot dig is its Boozy finish and its mouthfeel. Even though it's not offensive, it is just not adding dimension to the brew. This brew would be on ""OMG"" status if it had more heft in its Mouthfeel and a smoother finish. The brew is Outstanding and I will drink again. This Brew is Recommended!",0.6658911538793204,4.5,0.995
Sip Of Sunshine,"I was lucky enough to get this in Pa. recently, and I am looking foward to seeing more of the competiition in Pa. soon. Which will save on gas for me and friends. Hahaha This brew is hops-alicious and fruit-tastic...it pours a nice lighter side of gold with a mild white foam with fair lacing, but not long lasting. The aromas are off the charts I think....with fruityness, hoppiness, and maybe slight grains or florals. The taste is just as spectacular with all of the nose coming along for the ride of sweetness and hoppiness and a bit mild ABV that makes a great combination for the palate. Ranks up there with the best of the best. As for feel it is smooth up front with a very very slight dryness on the back, but fills the mouth with enjoyment in this wonderful IPA. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the sunshune !!!!",0.6568778616131035,4.5,0.995
Todd The Axe Man,Received a 4pack thanks to Beer Temple Chicago’s great online service.  Had heard good things but pretty delighted to see the hype was spot on Ratings reflect fairly fresh canned beer. Look and feel might be even better if fresh pour on tap. Just missed that during visit to Surly a bit ago. This is as promised...a Citra/Mosaic Bomb. Resplendent ... yea actually best word to describe...with citrus juicey goodness backed up the great choice of marrying to Golden Nugget malt.  Smooth creamy body that provides super nice base to the otherwise crispy refreshing carbonation. Yum!

Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Bottling date: 4/26/2011  A: Pours an absolutely stunning and vibrant cherry red color. Pretty much opaque red. A two finger pink head rises, and gently recedes to a ring that sticks throughout. Some light lace. An absolute looker. S: Right up front is the cherries. Slightly tart, slightly sweet. An amazing vanilla and oak aroma. Everything is so clean here. T: Quite a bit more mouth puckering sourness and acidic flavor than in the nose. Though still amazing. Tart cherries, with enough vanilla sweetness to counter that. Big oak and wood flavors. Certainly some funk. Though the acidic character covers it up. Not the funk bomb I thought it was going to be. More of an amazingly clean, crisp, and sour lambic. Love it. M/D: A medium body and perfect carbonation. Crisp, effervescent and amazingly clean. So easy and enjoyable to drink. It will be a shame when the bottle is gone.   What amazes me about this is how clean and crisp all the nuances are. All without the huge funky, cheesyness of some other versions. Not that that is bad at all, just different. Here the acidic/sour fruits and barrel character being the hole show. World class, and one of my favorite lambics.",0.7015016026874524,4.5,0.995
Thicket,"Appearance: Beautiful dark blackberry juice. Medium size head due to the high carbonation (starting in the bottle once I cracked the cap). I was afraid I was in for a ""gusher"" but it held off.  Smell: Wow, blackberries to the max. Jammy along with a strong acidity right from the nose. I could smell this brew for hours.  Taste: SOUR! Before the blackberries could hit I was struck by a huge sourness that got you right in the jaw like a Sour Patch Kid. While I do love sours, this was a but much right off the bat. As the brew warmed the sourness subsided (or maybe I was just getting use to it). Aside from the sourness you get, you guessed it, tons of jammy blackberries. As it warmed I got a slightly buttery and briny flavor as I sipped. Interesting and I liked it.   Mouthfeel: This was dry, but not intensely dry. It had a nice body and as noted it was well carbonated.   Overall this was my first experience with something from Side Project and I was very pleased. If you like fruited sours (and I'm talking intense sours) then I highly recommend.",0.6634536761430164,4.5,0.995
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Pouring with a thick viscosity that's damn near reduced balsamic, a blackish-brown gloss begins coating my companion's lips at first sip, like she's gone full goth. A uniform, dark mocha blanket builds over top of the void black body, but that quickly fizzles out, leaving nothing but brown staining legs that coat the glass with a swirl.  Hypnotizing aromas of deep, dark smoky maple swirl into a luscious malt that brings to mind dark cocoa wafer and mocha. A surprising barrel presence graces the nose without any heat, exhibiting a super oaky but dark wet char that's not spicy or overpowering. The bourbon barrel also delivers a lightly sharp toasted coconut scent as it warms.  Intenesly rich and smoky maple flavors are met with a deeply earthy, dark roasted coffee that I don't recall getting as much of in the numerous Mornin' Delight pours and bottles I've had over the years. Raisinets and dark cocoa wafer intermingle with the aforementioned flavors, while a substantial charred oak and bourbon complexity amps KBBS up considerably. The black peppery woodiness adds a mild heat, and the divine maple aftertaste lingers forever, with a nicely warm exhale.   The super viscous and velvety thick body suppresses the bourbon heat well. A slow to surface fizz brings a faint sting with it during the sticky, semi-dry yet impossibly round swallow. As you get to the bottom of the glass, it thins out a bit and becomes a bit boozier and less complex, but such is life. Nothing is ever really perfect, is it?  2014 vintage, gold wax",0.6717572663128241,5.0,0.9949
Chocolate Rain,"750 mL bottle , bottled on 03/04/2013.  Appearance: Pours a dark, deep oak brown with a hint of cherry coloring. Leaves behind a solid finger of off-white head.  Smell: Sweet bourbon, strong vanilla, dark chocolate, toffee, caramel. Really delicious combination of aromas. The vanilla really stands out, maybe more than in any other beer I've had.  Taste: Bourbon and vanilla come out right away, front and center, along with milk and dark chocolate, toffee, more vanilla. The layers of strong, sweet flavors mask the alcohol expertly. Some heat is definitely there but it only adds to this beer. Very sweet, but not overly so - really well done.  Mouth-feel: Silky texture with low to medium carbonation. Medium to heavy body. Very smooth and creamy.  Overall: This is a terrific monster of a stout for chocolate lovers. Definitely sweet, and the alcohol is masked brilliantly. This one packs a whole lot of flavor and the smell and taste match each other very well, in a good way. Definitely worth seeking out.",0.6788170492648616,4.75,0.9949
Sang Noir,"On tap at the barrel house into a snifter/tulip glass.  A-The beer arrives with a thin cap of foam. It is very dark underneath, and sort of a purplish ruby hue. The beer is still looking in the glass. The head leaves a stray chunk of lacing on the glass.  S-The smell is a fantastic vinous mixture of sour cherry, oak, vanilla, raisin, and earthy soil. It is very tart, but not acidic or overwhelming. Alcohol is not apparent at all. Very oud bruin like in character.  T-The taste, like the smell, is fantastic. The brew balances earthy, funky oak flavors with sweet, dried fruit (cherries, raisins, prunes), and a big dose or tart cherry sourness. No one flavor is overdone. This is also one of the more vinous beers I have tasted recently.   M-The feel is medium body with a crisp, chunky carbonation that fades quickly on the palate.  O-This is a great beer and easily the best wild/sour beer I have tried in a while. It is complex with a great balance of earthy, sweet, and sour flavors. The cherry character here is really well done. as it permeates the beer, but never overwhelms it.

Flora,"750ml bottle, Batch #6, poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass. Enjoyed on 7.4.15, reviewed from Tasting Journal.   The beer pours a nice golden apricot color, lemon hues, hazy and cloudy with a large, billowy and soapy white head, about 3 fingers high that has fantastic retention and lace. The aroma is wonderful, tart wheat, oaky acidic wine character, loads of wildflower, mineral water, citrus fruits, and light berry esters. The flavors are great, wheaty and doughy malt, tartness right up front, lightly citrusy, rustic wildflower, saison yeast, wine barrel that is both earthy and acidic, chewy oak sweetness and hearty mineral water. Loads going on, plenty of nice saison base that plays really, really well with the wine character. The mouthfeel is quite nice, coating, super smooth, gentle carbonation, creamy, delicate, delightful tart finish.   Verdict: Another fantastic saison from Hill Farmstead and yet another example of Shaun's prowess with utilizing wine barrels. Plenty of complexity, brightness, nice tartness, very delicate, so refreshing and easy to drink.",0.7133559871541394,4.5,0.9948
Black Tuesday,"First off, huge thanks to Derek (@2beerdogs) for the chance to sample this gem. His beer karma is much appreciated.   Aroma: Big raisin and plum notes abound. Low woody notes and strong bourbon character up front. No hop aroma. Big dark fruit and licorice notes abound. I love the well knit character of the dark fruit aromas, licorice, and woody notes. The smell hugs my nose like a warm blanket.  Appearance: Inky black pour with a moderate-low tan head. The head retention is good.  Flavor: More dark fruit with a big sugary molasses character. Low woody notes as in the nose with a background bitterness and slight roast character to provide a counterpoint. Hints of vanilla emerge as it warms. The finish is clean and dry. The balance is definitely malty with wonderfully knit flavors and amazing depth. The aftertaste is lingering and slightly woody.   Mouthfeel: Medium-full bodied with medium-low carbonation. Silky on the tongue with a tinge of alcohol heat.   Overall impression: While still exhibiting the character of a wood-aged Imperial Stout it also reminds me of a well-aged English Barleywine. There is depth to this beer that shows different layers each time you sample it. Truly an amazing feat. This is the best barrel-aged beer I've had. A treat worthy of all the hype.",0.6970762604641844,4.5,0.9948
Beatification,"B2 375 into a medium-sized Duvel tulip. Gigantic thanks to Matt for sharing this, a long-time top want of mine. I owe you one.  A: Hazy pale amber body with a handful of coarse white bubbles. Decent, but uninspiring.  S: Funk + acid. Wow. Floral, citrus, and tropical aromas overlaid atop pure sourness. This is AWA perfection: complex, powerful, and simply overwhelming.  T: Soft fruitiness up front, pure lemony sourness thereafter. A bit of floral funk, and just lovely pure sourness. Great. My only complaint is that I would have liked a bit more dirtiness from the funk, but I'll take the enamel-ripping sourness and be happy with it.  M: Creamy, lively medium body. Perfect.  O: This one lived up to its reputation: brutally sour, incredibly delicious, and simply wonderful. Worth seeking out.  Cheers!",0.7090167772547172,4.5,0.9948
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"750ml bottle, dated April 26, 2011, poured into a Drie Fonteinen wine glass.   The beer pours a deep ruby red color, hazy with just a bit of clarity when struck by the light, while a fluffy, fizzy pink head rises out of the beer, nearly 2 and a half fingers high that dissipates immediately leaving no lace behind, and just a light film around the rim of the glass. The aroma is beautiful, huge burst of fresh cherry, light funk, delicate spicing and just a touch of sugary sweetness. It's jammy, pie like and just delightful. It translates very well on the tongue, lots of jammy cherries, a bit of strawberry sweetness as well, the funk is quite delicate that brings out some light citrus peel that brings out the tart, tanginess of the beer. The malt is soft, a bit chewy and is the perfect crust to the cherry pie. The body is nice, light, lively, and bubbly, could coat the mouth a bit better, the finish is a little weak but does have a nice crisp quality.  Verdict: A really fantastic kriek from Drie Fronteinen, one of their better fruited beers for sure. It's jammy, pie like, and nice and delicate with nice brightness. It's right up there with some of the better fruited sours, perhaps it could use some perk in the body to really take this to the next level.",0.6982037441831528,4.5,0.9948
Caffè Americano,"Poured from the bottle into a large snifter glass.  Deep dark mocha head, with barely a finger created of fine foam, left to a large bubbled collar while settling and no puck Whispy top, and a classic dark walnut brown body.  Excellent stout aroma. Hints a bit boozy forward, with touches of almost brandy like heat. Wonderful milky and rich vanilla coffee aromas come right off. Silky smelling and velvety sensing, touches quite a bit of thick fudge like chocolate tones as well.  Palate is very nice. Silky and flavorful tones, but there's a touch of sharp bite here on the palate from some heat that takes away just a little bit more pleasure. Still the flavors are wonderfully top notch. A rich fudge and vanilla flavor on first sip, following coffee and sharp bitter spices while drinking. Milky texture with vanilla and velvet rich tones. Spiced chocolate hits the palate nicely as well. Some well controlled heat, but it's heat nonetheless.  As mentioned comes out a bit stinging, but it's a good one. Real nice well crafted large stout.",0.7049659793083612,4.25,0.9947
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Serving: 12 oz. bottled poured into a Founder's CBS snifter. Bottled on 6/2/17, making this just under 7 months old.  A: Man, this is one slick beer. Pitch black, pours like motor oil. Reminiscent of BCBS. Way slicker than Black Note.  S: Lot of barrel up front, oaky, some char. Very similar to Black Note and the lack of Double Cream Stout isn't noticeable here.  T: Very nice. The hoppy aggressiveness of Expedition is still noticeable here up front, but it's definitely tamed by the barrel. The sweetness balance from DCS is definitely missing. Barrel character is nice.   M: This is where this beer wins. Super thick mouthfeel, a huge departure from Black Note. Not sure why there's such a difference, but maybe the lighter DCS thins out Black Note?  O: Very nice beer, as expected. I was surprised by the huge mouthfeel and slick appearance, which I liked. But also surprised by how much residual bitterness is still there from the Expedition. Makes me appreciate the balance of Black Note. If Black Note had the appearance and mouthfeel of this beer, that would almost be perfect. In a blind test, I might prefer this over Black Note for the mouthfeel. But head to head, they're almost equals. Definitely an improvement on regular Expedition Stout.   Recommendation: Extremely hard to come by, this beer is worth trading for (just like I did - shout out to BeerEconomicus).",0.6392806702025053,4.75,0.9947
Beatification,"Thanks to Thebroth for hooking me up with a bottle.  Appearance: Slightly hazed bright gold. Head is bright white and drops to a tiny, bubbly collar with a wispy cap. Carbonation is lively but not aggressive.   Smell: Mild powdery funk. Oak barrels add a nice woody earthiness. Some lactic tartness as well. Lemon zest with a mild floral undertone. Some old cheese. Touch of Brett breadiness. All kinds of funk with a budding sour edge. Layers of wild. Touch of yeast.  Taste: Lactic acid snap right up front. Sharp and bright. Touches of Brett funk add some hay and grass. Powdery yeast. Lemon zest with some fresh squeezed lemon juice. Some backing sweetness. Wood helps mellow some of the more aggressive tart flavors. Almost citric level of tartness. The barrel Influence helps pull everything together. Mild floral elements. Musty with some hints of ripe cheese. Sharp.   Mouthfeel: Bright. Light body pushes toward medium. Carbonation is moderate, but effervescent. Flavor spreads and dries on each sip. Lingering powdery tartness.   Overall: Top notch stuff. Incredibly complex blend with nice levels of funk and sour.  I'm glad I got to try this. It's worth all the hype and it would likely age incredibly well. Definitely a top showing from an already top level brewery. Incredible stuff to be had. Too bad I don't have more.",0.7058351807153104,4.5,0.9946
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Sampling a cellar temp 12 oz bottle poured into my snifter. Another part of the deal with @jhavs, Thank you! The beer pours a jet black hue with minimal tan head foaming up and fading quickly to a thin edge layer. The aroma is boozy! Lots of bourbon and vanilla and some peppery heat too. Rich dark chocolate and molasses also mix in but I dont get any hop presence on this brew. The first sip reveals a thick body and coating sticky texture. Carbonation is mild, fine and gentle. This is a sipping brew! WOW! BIG physical traits here. Flavor is rich and malty, with dark chocolate high cacao stuff, molasses, some burnt coffee and a bit of bourbon and vanilla mixing. The finish is sweeter with some brown sugar and bourbon coming through and then the warming booze comes in too. This is a big beer and it lets you know too. Nice complex and bold beer. Glad I finally got to try this one as I find it very enjoyable. Definitely a sipping beer but certainly an enjoyable one!",0.6630409294761265,4.5,0.9946
Flora - Blueberry,"Reviewed from notes from 7/27/14  A- Pours a deep glowing purple with a small light pink head that quickly recedes to a collar that leaves some nice lacing. Little legs of small bubbles climb to the top. Some blueberry sediment is seen in suspension. Super pretty!  S- Bright, tart citrus and blueberry burst from the glass! There is huge influence from the wine barrel, and a good amount of pleasant funk. Lemony tartness, a touch of wheat, and nice oaky tannins. Pleasantly yeasty, with a characteristic Brett aroma as well as lacto.  T- Tangy and tart, yet a bit restrained, not overdoing anything. The wine barrel and grape influence is noticeable throughout. Nice acidity, lightly sweet, but balanced by dryness and tartness. There is a distinct taste like the finishing taste of a blueberry. An utterly delightful saison!  M- The mouth feel is very dry, light to medium in body, and well carbonated.  O- Everything about this made for a delightful experience! It is super refreshing with all the bright citrusy and tart flavors, and the dryness just begs you to take another sip. Another Hill Farmstead masterpiece!",0.7116849020577518,4.5,0.9946
Society & Solitude #4,"d from a 750mL growler into a Hill Farmstead Stemmed balloon glass. Bottled yesterday at the brewery.  Pours a deep orange, hazy unfiltered body with a generous white head, reducing fairly quickly but leaving blotchy white lacing.   Bright, fresh, tropical aromas shine through the foam - pineapple, fresh citrus, raw hops, slight buttery aromas come through at times.   On the tongue is an explosion of fresh hops, a nice combination of juicy tropical fruits and delicious dank, resinous zing. Citrus, grapefruit, pineapple. Malt backbone is there -this makes for a nice, medium body with medium-low carbonation.   I didn't expect anything less from HF - where some of the best IPAs in the world are brewed. Perfectly balanced, super flavorful, and an absolute enjoyment to drink.",0.7114862519994654,4.5,0.9946
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Date: Bottled on 10/16/18, enjoyed on 11/20/18.  Appearance: Almost a total blackout with a bit of deep ruby. Minimal mocha head that never really generated to begin with.  Aroma: Great bourbon aroma up front, not overly strong but certainly not lacking either. Next comes waves of sweet dark cherries and bitter-sweet fudgy chocolate. There is are additional aromas of vanilla, oak, and cacao powder as well. Some roasted malt quality is in here too, but no real deep coffee roast.  Taste: The taste actually leans more towards the bitter roasted side than what the nose indicated, it has the natural bourbon and roasted malts up front with a decent bitterness that again tastes more like deep roasted grains than coffee. I get some molasses in here also. The oak barrel comes through in the taste as well and the chocolate, rather than being fudge like, is ultra dark bitter chocolate brownie mix. The dark fruits are more rich date like in nature than the sweet cherry of the nose. The mouthfeel is very smooth and I must say, there is only the faintest hint of the sizable ABV. Its nice to finally check this one off the whale list and it was a very enjoyable, quality beer but to me, some of the more delicate nuances of the regular version are covered up with this variant. I feel that maybe a 50% barrel aged version would have better allowed the wonderful base beer to come through. As it warms, the batter like chocolate and vanilla seemingly increase even more.",0.6891526086900663,4.5,0.9946
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Thanks translucent for sharing this beer.  2002 label, 2004 cork.  A- Pours a nice looking reddish brown color, cloudy body, yellow hues come out, ½ fingers worth of a light pink head. S- Very pungent smelling beer, huge funky musty raspberry presence, tart, vinegar really nice, makes my mouth water. T- WOW….huge tart flavor, the sour presence is so big, really acidic, very puckering, some oak is present, raspberries are there but not upfront, ageing has done wonders to this beer. M- Light body, moderate to low carbonation, really puckering, dry finish. O- This beer was pretty impressive, incredibly puckering and tart, really enjoyed my 5 oz pour, would love to try a fresh bottle of this to compare.  Recently had the 2008 Version and i enjoyed the freshness of the beer more so than the aged version. Love the fresh raspberries that come out, really easy drinking, nice tartness and funk.",0.6563132846865756,4.0,0.9945
Peche 'n Brett,"Appearance. A little bit of a gusher but this came straight from the cellar without additional chilling in the fridge. Pours a bright, rich gold with a little peach and a finger of white head that leaves some great lace.   Smell. Massive amounts of peach ...not exactly fresh but sweet and tart like a fresh peach pie, some dry brett funk and dried hardwood, a bit of light grainy malt and maybe a drop of rum.  Taste. Nice light peaches, lightly sweet and lightly sour much like fruit itself, some dry brett, a bit of bitter wood and little wheaty and grainy light malts. The brett lasts a while on the tongue.  Mouthfeel. Medium body, medium+ soft carbonation. Nice warmth in the throat.   Overall. A very nice saison with plenty of peaches. Nothing too mind blowing, but a very high quality beer like everything from this brewer.",0.6768919106786235,4.25,0.9945
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"Canned 9/23/16. Consumed 11/27/16.  A: Beer pours pitch black in the glass with about a finger of mocha-, brown-sugar-colored head made of tiny, tightly packed bubbles. It's pitch black in the glass; no brown or red hues, not even around the edge of the glass. Super dense lacing on the glass. Absolutely stunning appearance overall--a bit more sludgy and this would be perfect.  S: Wow, this is a freaking chocolate bomb. So much chocolate up front—not overly sweet, actually very reminiscent of dark chocolate Hershey’s syrup with a hint of milk chocolatey sweetness. Behind this, there’s a really smooth, soft coffee note. The coffee is very delicate—not acrid or peppery, but, rather, a perfect, lightly bitter complement to the chocolate. Hint of roasted malt on the back end, but predominantly, this smells like a homemade glass of chocolate milk with an overwhelming amount of Hershey’s syrup.  T: My goodness. Insane amounts of dark chocolate and a bit of milk chocolate and supporting coffee roast. That same Hershey’s syrup note hits up front, but it’s quickly accompanied by some semi-sweet cocoa nibs. Roasted malt is more apparent mid-taste, but the aftertaste is, again, dominated by the sugary sweet chocolate. I also get a hint of vanilla as the taste lingers on the tongue. It has the flavor intensity of straight Hershey’s syrup, but the sweetness somehow isn’t at all cloying.   M: At this point, I don’t know what to expect from Tree House in this department other than soft, light, and—somehow—full. This is as creamy and mouth-coating as some 10-11% stouts I’ve had. It doesn’t have the sludgy weight of a big imperial stout, but the flavor intensity is there—which means this one is dangerously easy to drink. It’s truly a mindfuck of a mouthfeel, giving the illusion of thickness while actually being quite light.  O: Jeez, this is freaking insanely good. I actually had a can of this about 5 weeks ago, and I think it’s gotten better with some age. The coffee bitterness has subsided, allowing this to become the most chocolate syrup-forward beer I’ve ever had. This is definitely an improvement on Single Shot and right there with Double Shot in my preference of Tree House’s stouts. It's certainly not the most complex stout, but for what it's trying to achieve, I feel it's pretty darn close to perfect.",0.674367047941347,4.75,0.9945
Thicket,"375ml bottle, generously shared by Erik, poured into a Side Project oversized wine glass. Enjoyed on 6.20.15, reviewed from Tasting Journal.   The beer pours a really nice purple/red color, opaque and hazy, really reminiscent of a blackberry with a slightly off white head, about a finger high that has nice retention and good lace. The aroma is welcoming, lots of blackberry, acidic red wine, hearty oak, funky yeast, lemon zest and tangy red grape linger well. The flavors are quite enjoyable, tart and fresh blackberry, juicy and jammy, red wine acidity, chewy oak, good funk, a little cheesy with a nice amount of mustiness, lemon zest cuts into the sourness a little, despite it's tart character, but offers some brightness and like the nose, lingering red grape and currants, fleshy and puckery. The mouthfeel is good, coating, zippy and lively with high carbonation levels, good dry tartness and an easy finish that has a crisp kick.   Verdict: A nice Wild Ale from Side Project, not overly sour, which I find to be a typical attribute with their fruited sours. Tart, acidic, balanced and a nice blackberry expression, not quite as epic and Fuzzy or Framboise du Fermier in terms of the representation of the fruit used, but very enjoyable nonetheless.",0.7163354062367575,4.0,0.9945
Black Tuesday,"Poured from the bottle into a snifter glass at Smoke & Barrel DC part of bottle exchange. From notes.   Surprisingly not as dark as thought it would be. A good brown mahogonay coming out of the bottle hits with a solid dark walnut body. Very opaque and har to see through.  Nose has a huge chunk of molasses and sticky quality. Lots of sticky toffee. Thick smelling. Good sense of controlled whiskey like heat, with complimenting red fruits of cherry and raspberry. Great smelling beer, luckily not too hot on the nose.  Palate hits with a good chunk of sweet taffy. Lots of sticky peppermint and warming menthol finish. Controlled warmth with a nice warming big hit in the pit of your stomach. Lots of chocolate sensations with a thick almost syrup like body. Fruit action comes after repeated sips and some warmth, hinting of thick red fruits of cherry/raspberry feeling. Much of the molasses seem to get left behind.  Overall the flavors are nicely balanced, and even at this high abv it's still incredibly easy to drink. Very memorable beer and quite enjoyable, very well made.",0.6674020787944859,4.5,0.9945
Black Tuesday,"Pours an oily, not completely black color with brown-red hints in it, with a small bubbly mohagony head, collapsing to a small lacing. The beer reveals thick alcohol legs after swirling, coating up the edges of the glass.   Offers an intense nose, consisting of scorched cocoa nibs, molasses and an intense warmth, resulting from the Bourbon barrel. Bourbon blends perfectly into sweeter, dark and full bodied aromas, revealing dried earth and walnut shell, topped off by a note of cinnamon and wooden vanilla. Very intriguing and well balanced, promising a huge, warming beer.  Drinks surprisingly easy, don't get me wrong, you can tell this is a big beer, but its Bourbon characteristic is amazingly well integrated into the beers overall taste. Drinks expectedly smooth, with a silk, full-bodied mouthfeel, featuring a long lasting warmth, while the taste evolves throughout, challenging the tastebuds in a pleasant way.  Tastes almost instantly of Bourbon, while its presence in the beer is that fundamental, that it only lends wooden oak initially to a foundation of burned rock sugar, wrapped up in a huge amount of earth and bakers chocolate. Develops a spicy, burning but pleasant bite, being far away fom numbing the palate, together with a present oakiness. Cocoa nibs develop more presence, as do vanilla beans, accompanied by a dry, warming Bourbon burn. Bourbon doesn't want to leave the palate at all, while milk chocolate and a note of creamy caramel join in, countering the wooden dryness perfectly. Ends with a long lasting glow, wandering down the throat, accompanied by chocolate, oak and a note of cinnamon.  A unique experience without a doubt. We zipped on this all night, and it took me more than a glass to adjust to the huge body of the beer. After that, it has been a real pleasure to drink it, while I can not confirm that this beer has a relatively thin mouthfeel, which is what I read before more than often. It exhibits a strinking depth and complexity, centered all around well entangled Bourbon, which always saves enough room on the palate for other flavors to unfold.",0.7053563058862976,4.25,0.9945
Society & Solitude #4,"75cl growler generously shared by Doug. Poured into a Cantillon wine glass today 9/14/2013 during our One Ear Anniversary tasting.  It pours that typical Hill Farmstead hazy golden colour.. with that typical 2cm white head with awesome retention. Not going to lie, this is like the 5th Hill Farmstead IPA I've ever had, and I'm thinking I've been so spoiled by this one.  Now, no question that this is the best DIPA I've ever smelled. It has so much papaya, mango, orange and tangerine I've ever smelled in a beer. It is just so pleasant, citrusy and smooth that I could sniff this growler forever. Of any IPA/DIPA I've ever had, if you ever made a perfume out of this, this is what I would do. It just smells so sweet, complex and fruity all at once.  Flavour on this one is just so great. I'm just trying to figure out if this hop profile can beat Ephraim's. In the end, its very close but no cigar. But no question, there is just so much citrus and tropical fruit in this one that it unseats Abner. And that's saying a lot. One of the best DIPAs I've ever had. Thank you Doug, for sharing this one!  Mouthfeel is typical Hill Farmstead. So full bodied, creamy and refreshing. I honestly wish all brewers would talk to this guy and incorporate his advice into making their beers this creamy and full bodied. The whole world would be better off for it. Its not dry at all, its bitter but yet so flavourful and drinkable that this beer disappears so soon.   Okay, so this is great. Its crazy to think about it though, if you're a total DIPA head, Vermont is the one state out of the 50 states in the Union that you would want to live in. This is the one of the best DIPAs I've ever had, and I cannot question the use of Citra and Galaxy hops in this. Wow!",0.6516715735586476,4.5,0.9945
Oude Geuze Vintage,"2005 vintage from a 37cl bottle. Pours darker than expected, apple cider amber, with a really nice, big, fizzly head. Nose is huge and literally fills the air with green apples, hay, grass, lemon candies. A lot of things going on here. Quite dry, but blossoms with a fermented apple character that's pretty rare in even the funkiest beers. very expressive and refined. Nicely balanced but could even benefit from a bit more age. A little chalky around the edges, maybe the yeast got stirred up. This is a really full bodied gueuze, lively, bursts with an intense fermented apple quality that's really neat and reminds me of Perseguidor 3.  2002 vintage 75cl bottle. Not much detail to add here as it's all old memories. I've had the red label one and the white label one, and honestly I preferred the white label 2002. In fact, that was a freakin amazing bottle in August 2010 and was one of the top 3 beers of the Akkurat / Belgium ""lambic tour"", even beside some other very heavy hitters.  Another bottle, this time a 2002 white label from a 750ml bottle. Really earthy on the nose, the funk almost expresses itself as mushroom. Of course rife with lemon, orange. Tons of oak on this, so dry, oak is almost too intense. This is extraordinarily bright and pungent, and it's pretty lovely. I need to drink this next to a Blauw.",0.6563102212280757,4.5,0.9945
Sip Of Sunshine,"Got in a BIF from Roguer. 16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 2/7/2017. Pours slightly hazy medium golden yellow color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, peach, passion fruit, papaya, pineapple, mango, melon, guava, berry, lemon/orange zest, light pepper/pine, honey, lightly toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/tropical/fruity hops and moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, grapefruit, peach, passion fruit, papaya, pineapple, mango, melon, guava, berry, lemon/orange zest, light pepper/pine, honey, lightly toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine/citrus peel/grassy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, peach, passion fruit, papaya, pineapple, mango, melon, guava, berry, lemon/orange peel, pepper, pine, honey, biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/fruity hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with fantastic malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from lingering bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy/sticky, and lightly resinous balanced mouthfeel that is great. Touch of rind near the end of the glass. Alcohol is well hidden with a mild warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an incredible DIPA. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/fruity hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the balanced bitterness. Super dank/juicy hops with balanced malt sweetness; with just enough dryness to not be overly sweet or astringent on hops. A highly enjoyable offering.",0.7007073428492032,4.5,0.9945
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Yet another version of this fine beer.   This one took me by surprise - by oaked, I assumed this beer was ""oaked"" so the big bourbon slap in the face almost made me cry.   Again, just like the regular Dark Lord in most respects, but with a massive overdosing of barrel aging that's up front & in your cage. Kudos to 3F for trying to improve & tamper with an already great beer, but this one feel just a bit short; the bourbon was over-aggressive for me, drowning out some of the best aspects of the regular Dark Lord. Some of the creaminess was disrupted, & the great towering blade of malts was compromised.   Still a very good beer & one I'd never turn my nose up at, but also a good example of turning a great beer into just a very good one by laying too much of the barrel into the glass.",0.6183883020784284,4.0,0.9945
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Smooth smooth smooth. This beer is smooth. For me, and many others it seems, the comparator is Prairie's Bomb. I think this is an apt comparison and, whereas I think BA Bomb! is a little too busy with the various components competing against one another, BA Oro Negro is seamless and the component parts work in harmony.  Pricey for a bottle but, hey, I appreciate the extra .7 ounces. Pours a viscous black with a brown, cardboard-colored head. Spotty brown lacing clings to the glass upon swirling. Nice one-finger head pops up and then dissipates fairly quickly.   Aroma is fantastic. Earthy nuttiness, oak, bourbon, chocolate, faint spiciness by way of cinnamon and peppers. Equal parts oaky, sweet, bourbon-hot, spicy. Glorious, really. There's an underlying smoothness to it all that I attribute to the barrel.  Taste, when you let the beer warm, is a wonderful cascade of sweet (chocolate, vanilla), bitter (bitter chocolate, light hops), boozy (bourbon), earthy (oak) and spicy (cinnamon and peppers). The peppers don't present any discernible taste but they bring pleasant tingly warmth that rests on the palate.  Smooth, soft (almost velvety) on the palate, this beer is at its best in overall feel. Luxurious without any sharp edges. Wonderful beer.",0.7071075745509671,4.5,0.9945
Oude Geuze Vintage,"750ml bottle of the 2007 vintage. Bottled 12/27/2007. Poured into a Drie Fonteinen stemmed glass 9/5/2014.  A- Beautiful hazy light copper-orange body. Three finger effervescent white head with great retention time. Not much lacing. [4.25]  S- As soon as the bottle is opened, the entire room was filled up by a citrusy funk. Very potent nose. Essentially, lemon zest, white wine grape must, musty cheese, oak, leather, funk. Incredible. This may very well be the best smelling geuze I've come across. [4.75]  F- Distinctly flavourful; very potent yet subtle. Tangerines, lemon zest, musty cheese, musty hay, oak, lather. Plenty of that signature Drie Fonteinen funk. Good amount of acidity but at the same time, it leaves your mouth wanting more. This is a true pleasure to drink in its complexity and power; especially when compared other sour beers in the same sitting- it is powerful, complex yet subtle enough that it does not overpower your palate and your drinking sensibilities. [4.75]  M- Medium body, perfectly carbonated- slightly prickly yet has a soft and billowy feel. The refreshingly dry citrus and oaky finish leaves you wanting more. [4.75]  O- I've not had the others, but the 2007 vintage is a clear home-run and deserves to be in the conversation with the other top lambics such as Lente and Zomer. Geuezes don't usually have a ton of variability in what flavours and aromas you can expect from them, but Armand seems to always find these barrels/blends where the best parts of the lambics are accentuated whilst minimizing the lesser aspects that might be there. World class. [4.75]  Final score: 4.725   Additional review: Oude Geuze Vintage 2012, 75cl cork and caged bottle, served in a 3F stemmed glass. Pours a medium orange-yellow body, one finger white head, excellent retention and lots of lacing. Picture perfect. Smell is sharp lemon, citrus, medium cheesy funk, moderate acetic acidity, oak, light mushroom, earth, touch of citrus rind. All kinds of things are going on here, and it's really something to behold. Flavour is phenomenal and just as complex as it smells; it softens slightly over time as it warms; a lot of lemon, citrus, and more damp oak and cheesy funk is apparent as the beer decants itself in the glass. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, crisp and moderately dry, yet very refreshing. It's intense but not to the point of mouthpuckering, but it has a ton of complexity and depth to it.",0.7214236277494237,4.75,0.9944
Nelson,"Picked up a bomber at the Trig's Cellar 70 in Wausau. The ""best by"" date says this one is good for another month. Poured right from the fridge into my Founders pint glass.  L: Pours a bright straw color, quite hazy, with about an inch of eggshell head that has some nice longevity and leaves significant lacing on the glass. Lively, profuse visible carbonation present.  S: Big tropical fruit--pineapple and mango, predominantly--and floral hop notes in the nose. There's also some nice grassy and melon notes, along with cracked pepper and wheat. Not exactly an assertive nose, but it's very inviting.  T: Cracker and bready malts at the front, with just a touch of sweetness. The hops come in with a rush of floral and tropical flavor--distinct, refined, and assertive, without utterly overshadowing the malt bill. Toward the middle, the flavor gains a distinctive grassy and wheat/rye quality which plays off the floral and fruit hops remarkably well. There's some cracked pepper and more earthy undertones there, as well. The back end continues the juicy tropical fruit flavor and the ongoing floral and grassy notes. The close takes on a resinous pine/grapefruit rind bitter that lingers nicely on the palate in the aftertaste.  F: Lighter-bodied without feeling in any way watered down. Smooth and bright at the start, a bit creamy in the middle, and decidedly bitter at the close. Nice level of carbonation. The bitter keeps it from being especially sessionable, but it still goes back quite easy.  O: This is definitely a special beer, and it's one of the few IPAs that I find myself called back to on a regular basis. It's lively, yet extremely well-balanced. It's very flavorful but understated. I can count on both hands the number of IPA I've had that I'd consider truly great: Nelson absolutely has a place among them.",0.7313266020642258,4.5,0.9944
Nectarine Premiere,"Another one thanks to rudzud.  Decent fluffy head hits 1/2 finger but crashes to a fizzy head covering fairly quickly, murky milky peach orange yellow color.   Tons of nectarine, and a stone fruit, fleshy peach apricot like, swirling reveals a nice woody earthy wet oak, hint wine, strange vine like earthy vegetal thing.   Taste brings mild sweetness, candy notes, but nice sour, sour stone fruit, nectarine city, nice tangy sour and big acidity, apricot like, fleshy nectarine and juice, hint of sour funk, hint yeast and cheesy funk. Touch of woody oak and earthy wet wood. Finish is quite sour, nice lingering tartness and mild acidity, hint funk, nice nectarine stone fruit lingering.

Green,"Can dated July 6, 2018. Many thanks to Anthony for gifting me my first Treehouse can.   Pours very hazy, bright yellow color with a bit of a golden hue around the edges. Thick, frothy white head with a mélange of bubbles that tend towards the smaller side of the spectrum.  Aroma is bright pineapple and a hint of the Galaxy-induced diesel I have discovered I am quite sensitive to this year, so take that part with a grain of salt. As it looks, I also get the aroma of a mango-papaya smoothie that’s heavier on the mango. I wouldn’t have called anything I smell orange sherbet had it not been written on the can, but it makes sense. Bubblegum comes out strongly as it warms, to a point, then disappears completely. Perhaps my nose adjusted to it quickly.   Pineapple, mango, orange, papaya, with a hint of resin at the very last bit of the sip. Bubblegum is faint but present with the resin, definitely takes a back seat until the beer warms up a bit. I’m more impressed by the aroma than the flavor.   Soft, full mouthfeel that leaves a thin film of resin on the tongue. I wouldn’t venture into calling it pillowy as it has a bite to it, a slight dryness to the finish that encourages one to continue drinking it. Warmth actually made it start to seem a bit aqueous, although perhaps I had agitated too much carbonation out of the beer.   Green is pretty damn delicious, plus the can art is pretty cool. I get why people would want to line up for this over the years, but I’m glad that the beer scene has gotten to a point where that’s not necessary. Perhaps I’ll find a time to stop into the brewery on the way to Boston someday, but for now I’m content to be grateful for Anthony’s generosity, enjoy the beer, and find a way to repay him…",0.656858288112244,4.25,0.9944
Society & Solitude #4,"Growler filled 8/31, consumed 9/6.  Appearance: Vibrant, glowing pale orange with an effervescent bone white head. Beautiful.  Nose: A bit subdued, surprisingly, but still excellent. Big juicy citrus: oranges, lemons, grapefruits. Some sharp apple and overripe mango. Tons of fruit. The galaxy adds a nice floral grassiness to everything.  Taste: One of the juiciest double IPAs I've tasted. Rich orange juice, fresh mangoes, lemon zest. There's a good bit of fresh-cut grass and white flowers mixed into the middle and a crisp, light toast backbone. Finishes sticky and lightly sweet.   Mouthfeel: Just about perfect. Full, sticky, maybe a hint too carbonated but its really hard to complain.   Overall: This may be my favorite IPA that I've had from Hill Farmstead. The juiciness is intense and the balance of it all is excellent. This is definitely in my top tier of double IPAs. I very much hope to get to drink this again someday.",0.7016833569323961,4.5,0.9944
Scaled Up,"Pours an extremely murky bright orange color with a 1 finger white head. The head is gone quickly but there's some good lacing.   The aroma has plenty of orange and melon, with some more subtle notes of grass and pine. There's also a faint, peppery malt character present.   The taste is very sweet up front. I get orange, melon, and tangerine, as well as a bit of peach. The middle hides some bitter piney notes, but the end follows up with more candied-orange sweetness. A nice, fruity flavor, but a bit too much on the sweet side.   The feel is very creamy and smooth, with relatively low carbonation. A tad dry, but quite refreshing. Alcohol is very well hidden.   Overall, a very good DIPA that falls a bit short of other Trillium offerings. The tropical, juicy sweetness that defines a great New England IPA is very much present here, but there isn't much else to balance it out. The flavors are very good, but just a bit too sweet for my tastes. That said, I still enjoyed it quite a bit.",0.710092115327221,4.25,0.9944
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"This one pours a pretty dark black, with a small mocha colored head, and not much lacing.  This smells like fruity and roasty coffee- the coffee is a strong aroma, but it doesn't completely dominate here. There's caramel, oak, bourbon, and tons of chocolate.  The coffee flavor in this is super nice, and well integrated into a superior base beer. There's lots of fudgy chocolate, with vanilla and caramel providing a nice hint of sweetness, and lots of dark fruit and a slightly smokey flavor from the coffee. The barrel character is also killer here, with lots of not-too-boozy bourbon flavor and a hint of oak.  My only real quibble with this beer is the body- I definitely wish it was a bit bigger. It's certainly not thin, though- it works well enough for me.  This is a super underrated BA stout. Most of Jackie O's stuff is super underrated. This is highly recommended.",0.6675379911106577,4.5,0.9944
Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Bottle into second Anniversary SARA stem.  Appearance is a radiant dark straw color (really striking), hazy body, and compact one finger white head that leaves a nice thin cap atop the beer. A lovely beer to look at to say the least.  Aroma is juicy tangerine, mandarin, blood orange, tropical mango, peach purée, white grapes, soft spicy saisonesque phenols, and the lightest touch of barrel. I mean, DAMN, this smells better than a million dollars. Just tons of citrus, and I mean any citrus you can think of, gorgeous white grape touch, nice teasing oak, and an apple/pear edge.   Taste reveals a quenching lacto presence and lemonade-like tartness. I mean it's really citrus forward on the palate. Yet it's lime, blood orange, and ruby red grapefruit that dominate that citrus character. The oak is a bit more aggressive on the taste but comes in to help balance out the citrus. White wine has a grip on the whole charade while brilliantly coming in to maximize complexity is the Brett and saison yeast blend of spice and funk. Wow...  Body on this is in the sturdy light category and the carbonation is spot on, fluffy yet not spritzy. A substantial lactic pucker and at times seems aggressive but at the end of the day it's wonderfully played. An oaky dryness lingers on the palate after the finish.   This is the embodiment of a near perfect barrel aged saison. It's hard to find any faults really. Everything seems to be there in just the right amount. Love how the barrel interplays with the rest of beer and love the way it still tastes like a true saison. Carbonation is wickedly great as sometimes this style suffers in that category. Now if only SARA/Triple Rock would make this a regular part of their line-up. Among the best of the best, I'm savoring every sip!",0.6988559181433117,4.75,0.9943
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Memorial day weekend brought out a red label 2003 bottle generously shared by Denise. Thanks!  Balanced and delicate. Tamed by age, but even at what... 10 years?... this blend was still fantastic. It was more funk than acid, which was a bit surprising, but welcome. There was a lovely citrus sour & sweet combination going on in the middle, and the funk up front led to a clean finish. Definitely not as cloying as ""fresh"" Oude Geuze from Drie Fonteinen.   Probably not the most complex brew of the day, but its balance rivaled Lou Pepe Gueuze, and promised good things from aging this style of beer. Happy to try it, thanks again!",0.6568456960159558,4.0,0.9943
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Huge thanks to thebouch01 for this bottle, which I’ve been looking forward to ever since it landed. And now that my wife is off having fun in D.C. - OK, she’s working - I’m busting it open. 375ML bottle split with no one. I hope she doesn’t read this.   The pour is dank black, right up to the edges, with minimal head. The smell is cold-hearted coffee, with a bump of chocolate. The bourbon slips up on me only after several whiffs, but it’s there. What a relief. I find myself with a lot of coffee, bourbon, & chocolate beers of late. I hope it’s a trend that lasts longer than 21 Pilots. Or whatever they are.   Champion Ground is more aggressive than a taunted pack of piranhas. I have to shake my head like Ash to clear it. Holy shit. There‘s more coffee in here than your average Nicaraguan county, & I can feel my bedtime ticking further into the future. I start to twitch & move faster. The bourbon sticks roots in the beans & lays down a field of boozy fire. Rich chocolate comes in & somehow overwhelms the other two mid-palate, & keeps running sweet right through the finish. Other notes: belly-warming alcohol, coffee, touch of spiciness, espresso, vanilla. And listing the ingredients is like stating that you had a hamburger at Mickie D’s vs. another at a Michelin-rated restaurant. They ain’t the same. Rich & creamy, with a drink ability that I could makes me wish I had three, or seventy, more bottles.   There’s only one word to describe this beer: holy mother of all that’s holy. This is hands down the best Jackie O’s beer I’ve ever tasted & could hold it’s (quick vanishing) head high in any company. A stellar beer that's run me right out of superlatives, & one of the best beers I've ever tasted. Sorry, hon.",0.5959734192348333,5.0,0.9943
Flora - Blueberry,"2019 vintage.  This one pours a deep but clear red color, with a small head, and a lot of lacing.  I had heard that there was some smoky/plasticky off-flavors in this batch - luckily, it's just delicious funky blueberry goodness on the nose, with tart blueberry skin and juice, lemon, toasty oak, grassy funk, and a sort of minerality.  Some of the Flora variants kind of overwhelm the delicate and absolutely delicious Flora base. This does that less than normal, as you get that lemony/citrusy/grassy flavor still fairly strongly. The blueberry is expressed well, still, and strongly featured here, mostly tart and sour, but with a slight juicy sweetness.  This is light bodied, crisp, and pretty clean, with not lingering sourness on the back end. It's quite drinkable.  This is definitely near the top of the fruited Flora pantheon - it's really nice stuff.",0.7258681899055263,4.5,0.9943
Peche 'n Brett,"2014 vintage poured into Teku.  Poursa murky orange much like peach purée mixed with filtered orange juice. Big tan head that lingers for a good while. Leaves a sticky film of bubbles on the top edges of the Teku.  Aroma is a bit subdued, it might be due to the cold temp. But there is plenty of juicy peach, guava, mango, strawberry, some bready malt, and a touch of that brettanomyces funk but barely there as the peach addition has taken over on this one.   The palate explodes. Literally, if this isn't the peachiest beer I have had then Clinton really never did inhale. I've had peach beers before and none have expressed the flavor as good as this one. Holy mackerel! Peach for days with an oak, musty mineral brett dry finish. Yes there is sweetness but it flows deep mid palate and comes crashing to a stop on the finish. A low tartness jumps out pre-finish which overwhelms that sweetness and by the time it's all said and done you are left with a pretty dry aftertaste. Upfront though it's like biting into a juicy peach mixed with lemon juice and tart pear cider. Awesome stuff.  Mouthfeel is crazy good. Someone complained about it being watery, well let me just say, they're crazy. It is a saison and should not have a medium or thicker body. This one sits between the heavier side of light and lighter side of medium. Makes the beer super drinkable. Awesome carbonation which can be a problem when Saisons go in barrels. Not here, ample carbonation that lifts some of those uber juicy flavors away assisting in keeping it from becoming cloying.   My final thoughts? Damn right deserves the hype that it gets and the only problem with this beer is that there is not enough. Logsdon does a good job in trying to spread the love but if you don't jump on this you get left out. This easily stands in my top three farmhouse ales (not sours) that I've had along with the LITTLE talked about Little Lobster On the Prairie and mega whale out of Hill Farmstead, Biere De Norma.  Having a saison showdown this week and this overshadows Prairies Eliza5beth pretty substantially. Still have a few more which may stack up against this, Convivial Suarez and Le Saissonier coming next.",0.6593851273525025,4.75,0.9943
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Had on tap at DLD '09 and reviewing notes.  Poured into a plastic cup. It pours a thick, motor oil black. A minimal dark brown head forms and quickly reduces to almost nothing. The left over oil slick on the glass is great.  The aroma was fantastic. There were nice levels of oak mixed with the usual suspects of intense dark chocolate and sweet malts. There was also a nice mixture of tobacco. Mild coffee notes.  The flavor was fantastic. This was a nice blend of the standard dark lord with a healthy, but not overwhelming oak taste along with a pleasant bourbon that rounds out the complexity.  The mouthfeel as expected, thick and smooth. It has a low level of carbonation that highlights the flavor superbly. Full bodied and somewhat sticky at the finish with a nice level lingering on the tongue.  This was fantastic. I love Dark Lord and this is comparable and I believe I am actually rating it better. I would love to compare this head to head with the original. It is very drinkable and about the only thing that may hinder drinkability is the strength but I will getting my hands on this again in the future, extremely good.",0.7086700646685947,5.0,0.9943
Peche 'n Brett,"750ml bottle, 2014 vintage, poured into a Logdsdon Cervoise.  The beer pours a super cloudy straw color, hues of apricot and orange with a very, very, lively white head, soapy and frothy that settles at about 3 fingers and has great retention and leaves a huge wall of lace. The aroma is beautiful, tons of peaches, juicy and fresh, nice bretty funk and yeast character with light spice with some pale must grain. The flavors follow nicely, loads of juicy peach, fleshy, juicy and fresh with a bit of the pear juice that is present that also comes across like white grapes, nice funkiness and yeast character, true to the saison style, pale cracked grain, very rustic with light mustiness. The mouthfeel is great, almost creamy at times but with lots of lively carbonation that coats so well and finishes crisply that lets off so nicely.  Verdict: Sensational saison from Logsdon and one of my favorite beers ever. The peaches are showcased perfectly without undermining the base beer or the style and crossing over into a wild ale. This is definitely a must try and just a spectacular beer.",0.6876939474353972,4.5,0.9943
Chocolate Rain,"Drank from a 1 pint 9.4 fl. oz/750ml wax dipped bottle acquired in a trade with surge1311 020912Lot30 Served in a tulip  Review #800  Opened in celebration of my friends Matt and Kelly's firstborn child's birth and drank while listening to Tay Zonday's hit single ""Chocolate Rain.""  The beer poured a surprisingly thin, mahogany brown. No real head and no lacing. Frothy tan colored bubbles dotted the liquid and quickly morphed into a thin ring of froth. With each swirl of the liquid, substantial legs trickled down the glass.  Bourbon came through super strong in the nose. This was perhaps the most bourbon forward beer I have ever sampled. Lots of toffee and brown sugar sweetness. Strong notes of vanilla bean and maple syrup. Hints of coconut. Dark fruits were also noticeable. Plums and raisins were most apparent.  The flavor profile almost followed the nose to a T. Tons of sweetness up front, with a big caramel malt/toffee presence. Very boozy from the start, but the booze was definitely welcomed. At 19.5% ABV, this drank surprisingly well. Super strong bourbon notes. Loads of vanilla bean. Lots of dark chocolate and dark fruits sweetness. Figs, plums and raisins came through strongest. Touch of burnt sugar and oak. Some roasted malt flavors were present, but the roast was surprisingly subtle.  The mouthfeel was rich and syrupy with an appropriately low carbonation. This beer could have been a bit thicker and chewier for something of this magnitude.  All in all, this was an amazingly interesting and complex beer. Although I wanted to compare it to Black Tuesday (which is my favorite beer of all time), this was a completely different beast. With its lighter appearance and mouthfeel and its sweeter, boozier and more fruit-forward aroma and flavor profile, I found more similarities between this and Melange No. 3 than with Black Tuesday.",0.6684268737825849,4.5,0.9943
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,A Good friend was kind enough to bring me this wonderful beer back from the north this holiday season and boy am I glad he did!  Poured this out of a pint sized can in a tulip glass 12/21/18 on the can enjoyed on 12/31/18.  Poured a wonderful pitch black with a two finger root beer like head that slowly went away. They beer has a wonderful chocolate and coffe aroma that dominate immediately. After my first sip I was blown away the roasted malts are heavenly with bursting chocolate and coffee flavor. Black licorice and coriander hold court on the finish.  This is a fantastic stout that is extremely drinkable! You get the wonderful complexities of af an imperial with the drinkable 6.5 ABV. Well done Treehouse!!!,0.6237928356420753,4.5,0.9943
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"2014 gold wax bottle. Poured into a snifter.  A- Pours a jet black with a half inch of mocha foam that takes it's time receding. Light does not pass through this beer. When swirled, this beer laces so well that it takes seconds for the beer to finish falling off the sides of the glass. Extremely impressive. After the head recedes, a small ring of foam remains around the edge of the glass.  S- Caramel brownie dunked in a cup of coffee. Outstanding smell.   T- strong maple sweetness up front followed by some chocolate notes and finished up with slightly bitter coffee/roast notes that just tie it all together and keeps it from becoming overly sweet. Amazing depth of flavor yet balanced enough to have you coming back for the next sip quickly.   M- Rich and silky. Full body on this beer. Notch below those Zhukov thickness levels, which is perfect. Very sticky  O- This is an amazing treat. I hope some day Toppling Goliath can release this in much greater amounts. The world needs to try this beer. One of the best beers I've ever had. I cannot find a weakness in this beer. I feel blessed that I had a chance to have this.",0.6408895542008023,5.0,0.9943
Double Orange Starfish,"Bottled 12/21/16. Consumed 12/30/16.  A: Pours an extremely murky deep gold with about two fingers of eggshell-colored head. The fullest of haze on this.. It looks almost brown in the glass due to the lack of light passing through the liquid. Head sticks around seemingly forever. Seriously, I'm now almost done with the glass 30 mins later and there still a layer of foam sitting up top. Tons of beautiful lacing too.  S: Up front, I get a ton of that orange/vanilla creamsicle/sorbet thing that Galaxy-hopped beers sometimes give off. In fact, this is probably the greatest intensity with which I've picked up on that outside of the nose on Tree House Green. It's huge orange, sweet doughy malt, and some peach and mango right behind that citrus explosion. On the backend there's definitely a piney/woodsy earthiness, what some describe as ""Galaxy dankness."" Aromatic intensity isn't as huge as I'd expect for an 8.3% beer, but the profile is pretty damn nice.  T: So I mentioned a comparison to Tree House Green on the nose... When I taste this, first thing that comes to mind is that killer flavor profile on Green. It follows the nose almost to a T... Insane amounts of what I can only describe as dank, musty orange creamsicle. It's so much raw orange, but with an almost vanilla-like sweetness and a creaminess that seriously makes you think you might just be drinking a melted down orange sorbet. Accompanying this are BIG flavors of peach, mango, a little bit of pineapple, an assertive sweet doughy malt presence, and a whole lotta earthiness on the finish. The earthy character is hard to pin down, but it's kinda herbal, kinda woodsy, and a little piney. I'm not getting any vegetal 'sweaty onion' notes from the Citra, and not much 'raw hop' flavor. Just straight dank citrus juice.  M: Pillowy soft mouthfeel on this, super delicate as it glides right across the palate with silky smoothness. Medium weight on the tongue is probably my biggest criticism of this beer--it almost drinks like a 6% beer with how light it feels (for the style), which offers extraordinary (yet dangerous) drinkability. I think a slightest heavier weight with add to the 'sorbet' flavor and soft carbonation to really create a 'creamy' mouthfeel, but that's largely preferential. I could definitely see others preferring the lighter body. There's a medium orange peel-y bitterness that comes in on the finish, and it does well to balance out that moderately sweet doughy malt character. Really really good stuff.  O: My goodness. I had high expectations for this one, but it has exceeded them. I know I've really harped on this, but this seriously reminds me SO much of Tree House Green. It's missing the brewery's signature 'bubblegum' yeast flavor, and it definitely doesn't have that creamy, full mouthfeel that the TH IPAs offer. But the flavor profile is spot-on, with a TON of fruit (orange sorbet, peach, mango), a pretty assertive malt presence (sweet and doughy, yet still light), and a bunch of earthy dankness. This is absolutely delicious, one of the best DIPAs I've had this year. Need more from Aslin!!",0.6967832673844048,4.5,0.9942
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"I am very appreciative of Stakem for sharing this 2008 bottled in '10 with Kegatron and me. Enjoyed from a Cantillon tulip to match. My 1000th bottle review  This is exactly what I conjure up in my mind when I think of a raspberry lambic, just outstanding in color and is beautiful sitting in the glass like a gem in its resplendence with a beautiful rosy glow and tight ring after collapsing from 3 fingers, the bead is tiny with light pink lace. The smell is incredible, just so packed with strong fruity and funky odor w/ light floral notes that are still punchy and fresh. The nose is intensely raspberry with kmild hint of sour yeast odor. I love the feel as much as the aroma with huge lactic acidity which seems to enhance the mild sweet tart edges of the fruitiness. There is a pretty dry finish, but semi-sharp with dry/acidic qualities and extremely high carbonation like champagne.  This blitzes the palate and mouth with both fruity sweet taste and very intense sour lactic infused flavor. The acidity intensifies as the beer is held in the mouth but there is enough sweetness in the flavor to balance from the full fruity raspberry enhancement. The taste comes off almost as bitter/spicy from the carbonic acid the high carbonation level provides. There is a puckering, mouth drying quality w/ slight woodiness and extra tart raspberry juiciness as it finishes with some residual berry, but the funk and bacteria sour flavors linger into the dry end. Simply a wonderful fruit lambic, not many out there that are this complex and able to be savored in the way I found this to be. Intense yet drinkable a true classic, one of the best I have ever had.",0.7268962609782794,5.0,0.9942

Sip Of Sunshine,"Type: 16-oz. can Glass: Beer Nerd tulip From: My friend Charlie  Price: $4.00 (estimated) Purchased: N/A; Received Jan. 27, 2017 Consumed: Jan. 28, 2017 Reviewed as: American Double / Imperial IPA  Misc.: Canned on Dec. 12, 2016 at 9:15 a.m. ET  Was lucky enough to get 10 pretty sweet beers sent to me by a college buddy. Decided to start with Lawson’s Lip of Sunshine, which I sampled on July 27, 2016 at the second annual MW bottleshare. Only gave it a 4 at the time but I was the last to have it and only had the ending. Hoping for it to live up to its reputation with a full review here.  Poured a straw-gold yellow semi-hazy color with 3-to-4 fingers of rocky white head. Bubble streams coming up from the bottom of the glass. Outstanding spotty lacing. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.25)  Smelled a potent mix of tropical and citrus fruit up front, getting juicy red grapefruit, tropical punch, passion fruit, mango, orange, pineapple, floral and some herbal. Definitely Citra in the hops, but not sure what else. Just fantastic on the nose. (Smell - 4.75)  Man, the taste was just as good. Got Citra, red grapefruit, fruit punch, passion fruit, very sugary, mango, blood orange, pineapple, floral and bitter tropical rind. (Taste - 4.50)  Light body. Oily-to-creamy texture. Average carbonation. Abrupt, citrusy, boozy finish. (Feel - 4.00)  This was fantastic. Much better than that warm sample in July. Pretty boozy and sugary though, not sure I’d want a 4-pack (yes I would). (Overall - 4.50)  4.50 | 100 | A+",0.6231793677786055,4.5,0.9942
Green,"11/17/17 ""this green pounds!!!"" I tried some of my allotment fresh, some with time to mellow out.  Appearance - three fingers of pillowy white head. A pale orange-yellow, almost exactly like orange juice. Extremely hazy and opaque. Beautiful. It could be fruit juice.  Smell - tropical fruits. Pineapple, mango, guava, grapefruit. Floral and pine. The aroma is extremely pungent, you can catch a whiff of the glass from a few feet away.  Taste - getting a lot of tropical fruit, much like the aroma. Pineapple and mango. Bready yeast, lightly bitter on the hops. A very mild ""toothpaste after orange juice"" flavor, but in the best way possible. It's quite pleasant.  Mouth feel - juicy with light carbonation. Light-Medium body with a pillowy feel on the tongue.  Overall - if it weren't for the head, you could totally pass this off as fruit juice. Easily drinkable, especially for the 7.5% abv. Strong aroma and taste are on point, it tastes just as good fresh (the day after canning) as it does a month later. Sediment never separated out like it did with my Bright offerings. Might be the best IPA I've had to date. Seems to be a bit of a whale lately, definitely worth going out of your way to acquire.",0.6881768731248271,4.75,0.9942
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Drank this wonderful beer at the best beer bar in Rome, Ma Che Siete Venuti A Fa. Very pleased to find this beer bar and a big thanks to the owner for bringing this out of the cellar for me. Sir, you are a good man. Served in a traditional wooden basket and poured into two lambic style glasses.  A: Pours a nice hazy yellow with a huge spritzy and fizzy white head. The head is larger than the body upon the initial pour, but this isn't surprising. Very spritzy and zippy looking with a vibrant yellow glow.  S: Very nice. Puckers your nose with lemon and light fruit sourness with an extremely dry oak scent. Very funky and tons of Brett barnyard.  T: Pretty amazing. Right up there with the best Geuze's out there. Extremely bone dry with tart, puckering sourness and a nice lemon and light fruit. Tons of oak as well.  M/D: Very spritzy, zippy and dry. Amazing.  This is one of the best Geuze's I've had.

Oude Geuze Vintage,"750ml bottle from Belgium. 2007 Vintage. Into a Rodenbach Grand Cru Tulip. 27 Dec 2007 bottling.   A: A beautiful hazy apricot in color with a dense white head that foams up to about an inch, quickly receding to a cap of foam. Big gobs of lacing are left behind on the edge of the glass. Beautiful beer.   S: Funky and incredibly sour. I love Armand's blends, there are just so many notes in the nose. Barnyard funk, strong sour notes, lemons, cherries, and funk, but also there are these crazy notes of creosote, and aromatic heavy crude oil. It sounds like the absolute strangest mix of things, but it smells so wonderful that I want to bury my nose in it all night.   T: Follows the nose quite nicely, huge sour note with a ton of funk. Strong notes of lemons, but there are also some notes of peaches and apricots in here, quite fruity actually. Surprisingly enough there is even a touch of sweetness that finds its way into the last lingering seconds before I swallow. Absolutely incredible stuff.   M: Slightly thick with enough carbonation to break it up. Dry and puckering. Spot on.   O: Absolutely wonderful, hands down the best Gueuze that I have ever had. I really have nothing else to say about it. Simply perfect.",0.6647361919486207,5.0,0.9942
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Bottled date: October 17, 2008.  Cranberry, blood-red color with an orange-red edge alongside the thin, white head. Not much carbonation activity in the beer to be seen. One of reddest-looking beers I've ever seen. Looking back at my Oude Kriek review, they're visually similar. Incredibly vibrant when held against the light. Smell carries a lot of the oakiness from the wooden casks, with the massive amounts of sour cherries present in this. Slight hint of a medicinal quality. Can't really smell the ""rareness"" factor of Schaerbeekse cherries, but they are considerably more sweeter on the nose than the Polish cherries used for the Oude Kriek. Very little funk– not as much as I had originally anticipated for almost a 3-year old bottle. Apple skin tartness is also present on the back side.  Taste is very clean, almost vinous too. The sweetness of the Schaerbeekse cherries is fantastic. Lots of nice lactic acid goodness, oaky earthiness, prickly tartness and a thin sherry-like dryness. The age shows with the tartness being a profound quality in the taste. Natural and organic-tasting overall. Not too different in taste compared to the Oude Kriek, except there is a bit more sugary goodness for the palate.  Light-bodied mouthfeel with little carbonation and a thin dryness in the finish of the beer. Great tasting lambic, for sure. I'd say the price is justified a bit– was just hoping to have experienced a bit more, considering the rarity of these cherries. Just lucky to have been able to get a bottle of this and give it a try.

Todd The Axe Man,"Had this on tap before a huge show our band played. I usually don't retroactive or back-date reviews, but this still deserves a vote.   It tapped out a beautiful hazy mango-pineapple blush, with plenty of depth and light on the edges. The head was of course typical world class on tap, with a heavy head but one that didn't get in the way of imbibing.   Aromas off the teat are a total bouquet of mango, grapefruit, pineapple, fresh squeezed orange, and light pine. As it warms it smells a bit more like armpit sweat, but hey that's part of an IPA's nature.   I have to admit - some hopheads are a bit too gushing on IPA's and I was a bit skeptical. I was unwilling to invest ina four pack, nor was I unwilling to shell out $4 a can for a single. Luckily this was on a cheap tap night during a week day...and holy freaking crap...what a total explosion of fresh fruit, juiced mangoes, and light pine resin. It keeps drinking easy and just doesn't quit. Have these guys perfected the IPA style?  Feel was equally on par - just amazing overall with a creamy finish and ample carbonation to keep the love going 'round.   Overall, Todd the Axe Man was a total experience. I figure $18 a four pack is still a bit steep, HOWEVER, if enjoyed by each can slowly over a few weeks, it's well worth the price of admission.",0.6241123114282279,4.25,0.9942
Flora,"A very lovely saison. It has the nice tartness that is characteristic of HF saisons, leaving a bit of a pucker but not in a dominating way. Flavour contains grape, oak, lemon and peach, with a slightly dry finish, with the oak really coming out. The mouthfeel is also terrific - nice and lively without being irritating, a softness that makes it very pleasant to drink. Hard to be too complimentary of this beer - it is a terrific example of a saison, with the yeast playing a very large role and light fruit flavours dancing about. The barrel treatment is also well done - it is notably better than Florence, which is already a very good beer. A pricy bottle but certainly worth it - I would have bought more if they let me!",0.6988398228813532,4.5,0.9942
Enjoy By IPA,"Picked up the 07.04.16 version and just a day late in my enjoyment: Poured into small chalice, color is straw gold, clear, nice bright white head with mainly fine bubbles, light flecky spots on the glass sides.  Smell is big citrus/grapefruit rind and pine/resin blend, light earthiness, very heavy on the pine late in the aroma with subtle maltiness.  Taste is similar to the aroma with dominant citrus/grapefruit flavors first then resin/pine/earthy notes late with subtle sweetness form the malt, light booze/ester and herbal note as well. I started my ratings at the 4 range then increased as the beer warmed and i kept pouring more from the bomber. Great aroma and taste.  Mouthfeel is definitely bitter and fresh at the same time, hop/bitterness level shocks the tongue but the countering sweetness balances nicely, great lingering presence and flavors.  Overall, a great idea and a great beer - beer freshness is a wonderful thing to promote and understand, with IPAs having a short shelf life for some of these fresh and floral flavors.",0.7072135662395771,4.25,0.9942
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"A - Had this on tap at Dark Lord Day 2010, poured into a plastic cup. Nicely black with some brown lacing sticking to the sides, I kind of think the plastic cup adds to the lacing effect, but it looked very cool.   S - It smells like Dark Lord, but with some nice subtle wood flavor added. Great chocolate, bourbon, oak smells with the normal Dark Lord greatness.  T - I love Dark Lord, especially the 2010 batch, and this is an improvement. Great cocoa, caramel, and a touch of espresso and huge oak influence that is perfectly done. Hints of vanilla and a bit of bourbon. Wow.  M - Thick, full bodied, coats the tongue.  D - So heavy, it would be hard to drink tons of, but all things considered, could do a lot more of this than anyone reasonably should be able t.",0.6128470191527646,4.5,0.9942
Darkstar November,"Hits the glass is a thick and viscous splash and a body that is black as night. Naming this after a stealth aircraft has been accurate so far. A very small head forms with the thickness of just a few millimeters before disappearing quickly. There is a touch of dark brown lacing down the side of the glass from the head, to go along with a few alcohol legs. The first smell of this beer turns into a strong greeting between your nose and the bourbon barrel it was aged in. Prominent bourbon and alcohol up front on the scent before a touch of the rye spiciness kicks in. The back end of the scent sweetens up just a touch with the molasses, but there is also a dark, roasty bitterness there as well.  Time to take a drink of this bad boy. Just like in the scent, the bourbon barrel is first on the scene, displaying plenty of its boozy past as well as a good, charred spice on the tongue. The barrel and bourbon flavors give way to the base malts a bit in the middle of the drink, with a healthy dose of bitter black malt and just a touch of spicy kick form the rye. The end of this drink sees a return of some barrel flavors with a touch of vanilla sweetness and oak spice. The molasses makes an appearance shortly after the swallow when a new wave of oxygen hits the tongue and gives you that distinct flavor. Lingering flavors on the tongue include molasses, light rye spice, bourbon and barrel, and just a touch of brown sugar-like sweetness.  Just like in the pour, this beer is thick and creamy on the tongue. It does also have a good dose of carbonation and a slightly drying sensation as you drink it. The alcohol is noticeable in both the flavor and feel of the beer, but not so much so as to distract for severely slow down the drink.  Overall, I like this beer a lot. It isn't one of my favorites by any means, but it is a very solid offering in the style. The rye and molasses are a nice addition to the base beer and compliment the bourbon barrel nicely. It drinks more smoothly as it warms and is a good beer to relax with and enjoy as the flavors change with the temperature.",0.6594220736984997,4.25,0.9941
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Had a 2017 bottle poured into a Teku and savored. Pours a little more viscous than most other beers, which I regard as a good sign.  It pains me to do it because I appreciate the effort that went into this beer, but I rate it a category below ""world class"".  This is a big, complex, and great beer, but it aims higher than it achieves. The 3 main components of this beer are plainly evident immediately upon drinking it: imperial stout, honey, and barrel-aging. This does give it a lot of complexity, especially as IS is complex to begin with and then you add honey and BA. But one flaw is that these 3 elements do not combine together to create something new. They exist side by side.  Another fault is the use of honey, which doesn't work as well as you would like. I love honey. Especially on hot biscuits where its cloying sweetness is the perfect foil to the starchy biscuit, especially with butter. With this beer, you get just the cloyingness, without really balancing anything. The honey also adds a definite silkiness to the mouth feel. Some people no doubt really like this silkiness, but I'd rather not have it.  I can't help think that the use of a different, more caramelized sweetener might have worked considerably better in fusing together the IS and BA flavors to create something really special. Something like maple syrup or brown sugar instead of honey.  On the plus side, they held the honey back enough so that it is not a sweet beer; it finishes with a strong and excellent bitterness. It has a world class finish, but then I remember the cloying honey flavor and that the BA flavors don't seem to add much, but just go along for the ride, and I realize there is room for improvement.  I hope to be in Truckee in December to try one of these on draft, but I am not currently planing to acquire more of this one.",0.6633099726440603,3.75,0.9941
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"To start off, I'd say regular Dorothy is my least favorite of the regular saison line up. It's still an enjoyable beer by all means, but given the choice I'd take clara/anna/Arthur etc.  So I had modest expectations for this starting out. But I was pleasantly surprised at how amazing the wine barrels changed this beer.  Huge nose full of Brett, lemon, and wine grapes notes. I could just sit and smell this beer all day. And it got much better as it warmed a bit.  For flavors, the hops hit you right off the bat but quickly smooth out into the lemon and grape flavors. Not a ton of overpowering barrel but it accents the sweet and hops very nicely. Ends with a bit of honey almost like anna-esky.  This was flat out fantastic. As good or better than flora, and right there behind art in terms of how it compares to the other BA saisons. A real treat",0.6308865234712829,4.5,0.9941
Green,"Can from Reagan1984 via northyorksammy. Thanks guys! Served in my Indie tasting snifter at work. Canned 8/19/2016.  A - It's a Northeastern IPA alright; turbid and murky. Off-white foam settles to a thin cap, thicker collar, and splotchy lacing. I'm still not a fan of drinking milky looking IPAs, but I realize this is 'to style' as well.  S - Passion fruit, guava, pineapple grass, citrus peel. Pretty hoppy, juicy, stuff. Some light sugary malt in the periphery to support things.  T - The taste is a bit sweeter and punchier, with great tropical fruit, citrus, zesty flavors mixed with sweet sugar cookie malts. I normally don't like Galaxy hops but whatever else Treehouse has mixed in as tempered things. Quite a nice IPA with the balance of flavors and bitterness that I prefer. Aftertaste is very...green.  M - Oily and resinous, with lingering stickiness on the palate. Surprised that this almost 8%. Drinks more like 5-6%. Good heft, on the heavier side of medium in body. Soft, medium-low carbonation.  D - Just a really well made IPA. Really appreciate that Greg was willing to brave the lines to grab some cans. I miss the good old days when Tree House was under the radar. Would happily drink again on any occasion.",0.6821968538406326,4.5,0.9941
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"The man with the plan brought this over to share a couple weeks back. Cheers dude! The label reads ""Kriek van Schaerbeekse Krieken,"" which is the same as this. If the two entries ever get merged, I figure it's safer to add the review here.   From a 750 into a tasting glass.  Bottled 18 January 2003  APPEARANCE: Pours a small, medium looking pink head with half decent retention. Body is a maroon red color with no real carbonation evident. Head recedes to a bubbly half wisp but eventually vanishes all together. Really nice color on this one.   SMELL: Light cherries on the nose still, with sour lemon and funky barnyard aromas. Slightly acidic as well.   TASTE: Sour lemon, sour cherries and a bit acidic up front, moving into a lovely finish of cherry and raspberry flavor, peppery notes, sour lemon, herbal flavors and a slight bit of acidity. Really nice after twelve years in the bottle.   PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Creamy and smooth on the palate, goes down nicely with a hint of acidity at the swallow and finishes dry but not overly puckering. Wonderful feel as well.   OVERALL: Excellent stuff. This one has softened out really nicely and the flavors work great as a whole. The slight touch of acidity is well measured as well. Lots of character and we all really enjoyed drinking this one. Thanks again for hanging out man!",0.6928308695614852,4.0,0.9941
Black Tuesday,"2018 bottle thanks to the generosity of @2beerdogs, opened in honour of my Opa Jan.  Pour is actually thinner/lighter than I'd expected, though once it gathers in the glass it does gain some more of that menace. But ultimately it's closer to a cola/dark syrup/dark chestnut brown than it is a molasses black. Not much head at all: nothing more than a drifting of bubbles around the edge. No lacing to speak of.   Nose brings less alcohol heat than I'd feared. Sweet bourbon vanilla and oak. Some caramel. Honestly just not as strong as I'd expected overall. More pleasant and mellow and sweet.   Flavour again belies the behemoth that lurks in these waters. 19.2% on the label, but I could be convinced of significantly less than that. Maybe not half, but closer to that than actuality. While I do get some heat, especially as I work my way through the glass, the prominent flavours are more the rest of the barrel, much like the nose. Vanilla, oak, caramel, maybe a hint of sweet sweet chocolate, maybe riesen-like toffee... This is decadent and rich without really being luxuriant.   Smoothe and while it's thin (unsurprising given the alcohol and that), it is not conspicuously so. Again, this is a masterclass in taking an overbearing characteristic and folding it in to subtly be simply a presence. That may sound like damning with faint praise, but I absolutely do not mean it as such. Dangerously easy to drink for the near-liqeuer level abv.  Thank you Derek for supplying me with this delicious inebriant!",0.6612149558352739,4.25,0.9941
Beatification,"Batch 3, a 750ml shared by tlay10, poured into a tulip. This batch is a blend of a base called Sonambic, which is 100% spontaneously fermented, and is blended with orphan beers to soften the mouthfeel.   Pale, hazy daffodil. Poured directly into the bottom of the glass, not much head is raised, but what I get is a thin, watery, airy white.  Funky nose. Tons of hay and barnyard aromas. Herbal mint and basil mix with dried lemon peel and hints of strawberry. Perfect balance, crazy complex.  In the flavor, the perfect amount of stale hay mixes with vinegary dried lemon peel and soft touches of wheat. The swallow brings an intense blast of tart lemon, vinegar and the perfect amount of fruity sweetness. Kind of like a yellow skittle, but miles more complex, and with hay and soft basil sprinkled throughout. Just. So. Smooth.   Fairly gentle, prickly carbonation excites the medium-light body as it moves across the tongue, but doesn’t display the crazy fizziness usually found in beers like this. If there is any alcohol it’s hard to notice amidst the tartness that’s currently causing me heartburn. I can feel it coating my mouth and eating away at my teeth.   I’m most impressed by the perfect balance of funk in here. It’s heavily tart, but there’s enough sweetness an barnyard to temper it and keep me going back sip after sip.   Batch 2: both funkier and fruitier in the nose than batch 2. Strawberries, wheat, maybe even some pear. Loads of funk, dried lemon peel. Little more sour than batch three, the tartness hits a completely different part of my jowls. Interestingly, as it’s become sweeter and fruitier in the nose, it’s become far more tart in the flavor. Not an improvement, not a step backward. Just different.   Ph1: this is a completely different beer. The nose is sweet and floral, with lots of honey, caramel, pear, lilac and cinnamon. On the palate, it’s a bit overcarbonated, exploding into bubbles that make the brew hard to taste. Same in the flavor, though: lilac, honey, caramel, pear. Compared to later Beatifications, this is lighter, more delicate, sweeter and more floral, with none of the aggressive tartness of the others. I like how different it is. Redemption is the base beer here, which makes sense.",0.6949829303353597,4.5,0.9941
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"thanks to rudzud, canned 8/02, super fresh ""we're made of star stuff"" Pours a nice dark mocha foamy head that fades at a quicker pace, bit of lacing and decent legs, pitch black beer  Nose is like thick luscious rich chocolate, cocoa, velvety and fudgey chocolate, a little fresh coffee but not a ton, fresh earthy roast, lactose sugar, milk chocolate, hint of caramel and nougat  Taste super rich creamy milk chocolate, cocoa, big fudgey and dark chocolate, lactose sugar and creamy oats, lush velvety cocoa, chocolate syrup, little nougat and caramel, some fresh roasted coffee beans, mild earthy but smooth coffee and some roasted flavors, touch of bitterness, dried lactose finish, coffee beans mixed with cocoa late, nice coffee and mocha lingering  Mouth is med bod, but thicker creamy milky and rich, decent carb a little cloy sweet  Overall very nice, enjoyable easy drinking, very well done",0.6420721823419259,4.5,0.9941
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"16 oz can dated 12/2/16 (so 6 weeks old or so) Poured into a pint glass as an opaque, orange juice color. Head barely topped half an inch and dissipated rather quickly. That's a knock for me. Nice clumps of lacing on the glass though.  The aroma is juicy with strong notes of orange and grapefruit and pine and smacks the nose just before you sip. Orange notes permeate the up-front flavor but then give way to hints of lime, grapefruit and resinous pine. Mouth feel is soft, almost creamy which I find very desirable. Malt take a back seat to the hops while the bitterness kicks in slowly, moderately strong. The sweet fruit tones linger even up to the end interplaying with the bitterness very nicely. That IMO is what makes this beer (and other similar trillium offerings) so successful. So many NE IPAs start off strong with the tropical notes but then fade rather quickly into standard fare. With this beer the juicy hop flavor continues and shifts over time.  [Edit:] I will say that I had another one 2 months later that is very ""fresh"" and the sweet hop notes are overridden by the pungent hoppiness of a new batch. I recommend letting it sit a while in both the fridge and the glass and you will be happier.  As expected, this is a flavor bomb that any lover of the style should be excited about getting their hands on. Myself... I feel privileged to have another one waiting for me in the fridge. By many measures that makes me a wealthy man.",0.6647599947419931,4.75,0.994
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Served on draught at Belmont Station in a Delirium Tremens snifter, Lou Pepe Framboise is bright, chill hazed magenta with a medium violet collar.  Smell is super bright raspberry, whoa! Actually, it's so sweet and fruity, that the nose reminds me a lot of Lindemans, with only a hint of rubbery phenols to let em know it's a real lambic. The vintage unknown, and Belmont said they've cellared it for a year, but with this much fruit, it can't be to much older...  Taste is a whole other ballgame, pure Cantillon sour bomb. Big lambic pucker, and while the fruity is still clearly there, it struggles to balance with the pure sourness, which is exactly how I like my fruit lambics! Rounded out with a nice chalky, baking soda finish.   Mouthfeel is slick and dry, with a medium light body and abrupt finish save for the long, lingering pucker.  Drinkability is great, this beer is the bomb. I love raspberries, and I love Cantillon, and I love this framboise. While not the sourest beer in their portfolio, and very fruit forward for a Cantillon, it still bring the pucker with loads of acidity. Super tasty, a rare treat on draught, I wish this was available year round!",0.6515223423836034,5.0,0.994
Aaron,"2016 batch drank in a hill farmstead stem on 3/11/2017  Look - this thing is thick and syrupy. Leaves a lot of lacing, especially for a barleywine. Minimal head, and a dark caramelly color with some layering  Smell - caramel, barrel, oak, sweet malts, some earthiness, some interesting dark fruit but can't put my finger on it, and toffee  Taste - follows the nose but the barrel really comes through exceptionally well. I don't get a ton of whiskey, but the oak is a great combination. The complexity of this is very impressive as the layers upon layers continue to come through as it warms.  Feel - best feel of a barleywine i've ever had. it's creamy and super drinkable with no booze at all. Feels like a 10% stout, which I have never had in this style of beer.  Overall - best ba barleywine i've ever had. Hands down. And I got this as a wedding gift, which made it even better to drink the whole bottle to myself.",0.6823319653199443,4.5,0.994
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"A big thanks to Jeff for this one. 375ml bottle into a Grrrz teku.   Pours a .5 finger foamy mocha colored head with moderate to low retention. Beer is pitch black and much thicker than your average porter. Lacing is spotty and sparse with little stick but big, oily legs. Average.  Nose is molasses, light coffee bean tartness, chocolate, fudge, mocha and a robust bourbon sweetness. Not too aromatic but the aroma is very nice.   Opens chocolate, maple syrup and mocha. Bourbon barrel aging is very apparent. Boozy in the middle with more hints of sweet soy sauce, chocolate, prunes, raisin and other dark dried fruit. Tobacco and oak in the middle to end. Finishes sweet with loads of syrup, fudge and booze. Same aftertaste. Excellent.   Medium bodied with low carbonation. Smooth, soft and a touch thin on the palate and goes down rich, foamy and silky. Finishes messy with a lingering, sticky aftertaste. The perfect balance of soft, smooth and robust.   Jackie O's dark offerings have been a bit hit or miss in my opinion. That being said, Bourbon Black Maple is awesome. The feel is spot on and the flavor is complex and well integrated. Definitely worth trying.",0.6863130640425673,4.75,0.994
Green,"Tree House Green  A: Like all Tree House beers, this pours completely opaque, letting no light through. The pure white head is about two fingers tall and has excellent retention. Lacing is also great. There is no visible large particulate, but it is so comically murky as to be off-putting. If not for the head, one could easily mistake this for a glass of pulpy orange juice. It is not quite to the ridiculous Juice Machine or Doppelganger level, but it is too much even for the substyle. 4.5/5  A: ""Green"" is not what comes out of the aroma at all. Sure, it is less overtly fruity than other TH offerings, it this still screams tropical, juicy fruit; in fact, it actually smells quite a bit like that titular gum. There is lots of orange, melon, and peach up front. Pineapple and a little grapefruit play supporting roles. Guava is notable as well. There is a hint of vegetation toward the back, but it is hardly obvious. Sugar cookie malt underpins the hops, as well as some yeasty bread. Thankfully there is no noticeable ""unfinished"" aroma that so many Tree House beers suffer from. Aside from a misleading name (yes, the story behind it has nothing to do with actual tasting notes), this is a very good smelling beer. 4.5/5  T: Though Tree House tends to eschew bitterness almost completely in their hop-forward beers, this one definitely has some of that much-needed balance. The Australian hop alluded to on the can is almost certainly Galaxy, which contributes loads of orange juice, melon, tangerine, pineapple, Juicy Fruit gum, guava, and finally its signature simultaneous piney, spicy, pithy, grassy bitterness, which lingers on and on and on. There are also notes of ruby grapefruit, mango, and lime. The malts are slightly sweet but mostly bready and hidden, a platform for the intense hoppiness to stand on. The one flaw is a weird classic pink bubblegum flavor that crops up here and there and throws the palate for a loop. There are no obvious yeast flavors or that off flavor that is present in other Tree House beers. This is a tour de force of hops and is perfectly balanced. What more can one ask for? 4.75/5  M: Typical Tree House creaminess and fullness, plus a very welcome bitterness that keeps the palate from fatiguing in the wake of juicy sweetness. The finish is actually moderately dry. Carbonation is soft and pleasant. No detectable alcohol even at 7.6%. Beers like this are so enjoyable to drink. 5/5  O: Do not listen to the hype on Julius, Juice Machine, King Julius, etc., as this is the Tree House beer to seek out. It is balanced in a way that the rest of them are not. It does not have off, unfinished flavors. It does not come off more like fruit juice and less like beer. This is Tree House's masterpiece, and do not let anyone tell you otherwise. As a result of standing in the shadow of its brothers, this one is easier to acquire as well. No, it is not the dank, ""green"" beer that perhaps one would expect based on the can and name, but it is a near-perfect example of the NE IPA style and comes closest to dethroning Trillium and The Alchemist's Focal Banger as Tree House has to this point. Pair with the partially ignored gem (by the masses) in an otherwise overrated discography, ""Kid A"" by Radiohead (""OK Computer"" is also excellent, however). 4.75/5",0.6805883572696022,4.75,0.9939
Sip Of Sunshine,"A: Not hazy...which is awesome. Bright orange and crystal clear with a stark white head. The head is about a finger and a half tall with mostly tiny bubbles that support a few, random, rouge, large bubbles. Scattered streams of bubbles run up the side of the glass while the head slowly subsides into a nice, coaster-thick cap, which rests in place. Lacing...  S: A combo of grapefruit and massive tropical aromas. The smell is not as massively strong as some other heavy hitters in the category, but if you ""inhale deeply"", you'll be greatly rewarded.  T: Gorgeous. Sweet orange, pineapple, mango, and grapefruit to provide a touch of bitterness. The malt bill is on the mildly sweet side, but very clean.   M: Slightly sweet, but crisp, clean, and bright. It does dry towards the finish, but not a ton. This is an exceptionally easy beer to drink. Body is light to medium, making it, well...gulp-able.  O: There are quite a few other Northeast IPAs with a lot of hype behind them, but this one lives up to it. It satisfies on the hop front, but is also a very crushable beer. Aggressively enjoyable is really the best phrase I can come up with to sum up this beer.",0.683851391471684,4.75,0.9939
Chocolate Rain,"Chocolate Rain Batch 2  Pours a jet black beer with a few bubbles breaking the surface. Syrupy and heavy in the glass, looks like I expected. Menacing....  The aroma is downright bad. Booze. The strongest alcohol aroma I've ever encountered in a beer. I thought I may just have the beer too cold (around 42 degrees) so I let it sit for 15 minutes and revisted, re-sniffing throughout the 90 minute session. Harsh alcohol, solvents, chemical aromas. As it warms, more of the beer and bourbon show up but it's REALLY boozy. Nothing like any of the BT vintages I've had.   The flavor is rich, sweet, and hot. Bourbon is light but there. Vanilla and Chocolate are more forward. The alcohol is very present but works into the whole package. Sweet, decadent, boozy, syrupy, bourbon, vanilla, char, roast, sweet dark fruits. Tasty but way over the top.   The mouthfeel is perfect for the style, perfect. Heavy, thick, syrupy. No way to complain about it!  Overall, meh? Good. I'd happily drink it but I prefer regular Black Tuesday. And while it's a cool beer and it has a ton going on it's just not worth the price and effort for a non RS member to obtain. Glad I got to try it and it was a perfect beer for Christmas.",0.6356647294320193,3.5,0.9939
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Cantillion Lou Pepe Framboise 2005  Poured from the 750ml wrapped, oversize capped, and moldy-corked bottle into a Belgian Snifter.  Appearance- Beer pours a hazed pink with a thin film of carbonation on the top that quickly mists to the sides of the glass. Lacing leaves a little bit of sticky on the sides, but that's about all there. Haze looks to have a bit of wheat in there.  Smell- Natural raspberries and that amazing trademark Cantilion yeast strain that only their fine beers possess. A wonderful leathery funk that I can't even really call brettanomyces, this funk smells completely different. Who knows what has happened to this beer after the past four years? It certainly has a uniqueness in there that I can't figure along with the pediococcus.  Taste- Tart.. Very tart and puckering, the raspberries don't taste the slightest bit fakey like some other lambics that we know of. The lingering sourness is very similiar to if you ate an entire bushel of unripe berries and it sticks to the tongue, but this is not unpleasant at all. The carbonation seems to permeate and seperate the taste buds, I hope this isn't a palate killer on the first beer of the night, but if it is, what a great beer to do it with.  Mouthfeel- Tart, puckering, medium low in carbonation, medium bodied, not warming, vinegary, effervescent.  Drinkability- Probably the best frambois I will ever have in my life, smooth, tart, lightly tingling on the lips, something I would love to have every day and I'm not the fruit beer guy. Sadly, I will likely never see it again. I need to go to Belgium!",0.6439574740665398,4.5,0.9938
Beatification,"Batch 6 Beatification, first time trying and super stoked! High expectations after trying other RR sours!  A: Pours a hazy opaque, yellow, slight orangish gold mix, the orangish gold mix is more of a hue as it closer resembles pineapple juice, nice and murky! No head when from the pour or after This beer looks fantastic!  S: Sour! Earthy! Fruity! Sweet! Funky! So much complexity going on with this beer! I get some apples, pear, pineapple, straw, and all those lovely combinations of funky and sour bacteria! Perfection!  T: An immediate rush of tartness once it hits your palate, initial you get the tart, sour bacteria with a lovely, apple, pear, pineapple fruit combination, then it transitions to straw and funk, and finishes with a perfectly balanced combination of everything! The best part with this beer is it lingers and the flavor ever so slowly fades away, and when it's gone it leaves you begging for more! Absolutely stunning!  M: This category is perfectly executed as always with RR sours, slightly dry, light, hint oily, and incredibly crisp, and somewhat unexplainable on how good the mouthfeel really is for this style. Perfect!  O:Blown away, had high hopes for this beer, and it surpassed them by a mile! It is going to be hard to ever find a sour better than this!

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"a 2010 vintage generously shared with me after quite literally years of anticipating this bottle together. its incredible stuff, worth the wait, and as good as anything i have had from these guys really, every bit as good as the lou kriek or the fou. deep dusty brick red in color, dense with fruit here, not as electric and bright looking as a lot of raspberry beers, and with a fizzy lazy head, not super robust there. the nose is mind melting for me, pure raspberry and insanely mature lambic funk and tartness, turbid wheaty aged hop base, tons of oak and brett, a well developed wild acidity as well, this is rather piquant, and then of course all the berry, as natural as it gets and like stuffing an entire handful of them in my face, as intense as can be. i smell it for awhile before i taste it, so complex and mouthwatering and inviting. great sourness up front in the flavor highlights the fruit right from the start, with the sturdy wood and mature wildness right there with it, tart and red winey towards the finish, a little sweet from the fruit, still malty in a lambic sense, and really brightly acidic and interesting. the complexity of the yeast elements here is as good as it gets, and why cantillon is so well regarded as far as i am concerned. the raspberries are perfect with it, and really bold in this beer. the maturity is unrivaled and the flavor is just incredible. beautiful lambic, famous for a reason, and probably even more striking to me now in terms of quality because there are so many lackluster fruited sours out there in the world. this is the cream!",0.7115526518112419,4.75,0.9938
Todd The Axe Man,"The stamp is a bit smudged, but it looks like the bottom of the can: says: ""CANNED ON 08/02/18 F4392 09:30""  Appearance: The body is a hazy gold under a thick white cap. It has very good retention. There are small particles suspended in the beer.  Aroma: The beer has a pleasantly soft aroma of tangerine and wildflowers.  Taste: The beer has a very nice mango flavor up front. There is a touch of grapefruit flavor and just a hint of grain in the background. It is a very pleasant tasting beer with a bright character.  Mouthfeel: The beer is light bodied and easy to drink with a semi-dry finish. It has low bitterness which is akin to drinking grapefruit juice.  Overall: The beer has a very bright character to it which is comprised of its fruity and citrusy flavors. What I found interesting is that after writing this review I read the back of the can and it said this was a ""...BRIGHT IPA..."" which was dead-on with how I perceived this beer. It has a very fresh and vibrant tone to it. This would be the perfect picnic or beach beer, especially because it is in a can. It has certainly made my list for these occasions. I would highly recommend it and I will buy it again.",0.699044887827179,4.0,0.9938
Beatification,"Batch 5. Thanks, eyebereej.  Pours a clear yellowish orange, with a small head that quickly dissipates. Minimal lacing, but some visible carbonation in the glass.  Oh man that's a strong smell. Comes to me easily as I pour the glass. Smells strongly of citrus. Lemon, orange, some peach, a little bit of a hay-like smell. Slightly musty. It smells like it's going to be pretty sour, I can get a bit of that mouth-puckering feeling just from a sniff. Pretty funky.  Yeah, that's pretty sour, but not at all unpleasant. Lots of citrus, some green apple, little bit of funk. Little bit of peppery spice at the finish.  Mouthfeel is just great. I don't know what else to say. I have absolutely no complaints.  The drinkability on this is nuts. I could down these all the time. Perfect summer beer: complex, light, and refreshing. Each sip finishes with this pleasant tartness that just makes me want to keep drinking. More, please!",0.6641143434929179,4.5,0.9937
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Cheers to Goblinmunkey7 for sharing this  Appearance: Somewhere between pale ruby and solid pink, with some clarity around the edges - small white head, but I can forgive this due to the style - leaves a few streaks of lacing  Smell: Tons of cherries and planks of oak - sour, tart cherry flesh and some cherry skin - nice oak aroma, smells oddly fresh - some funky notes in addition to the sour, with some clean barnyard and a light touch of vinegar - malts are very pale and mostly hidden  Taste: Dry, tart cherries and oak - minimal sweetness, more or less tastes like whole cherries (flesh and skin) - works remarkably well with the oak, which is also quite tasty - very dry and very tart - sour, but mostly tart - some light musty funk  Mouthfeel: Medium body, low carbonation, smooth with a nice, lingering dry aftertaste  Overall: Excellent stuff  This is very dry and very tart with some nice cherry flavor. It's a solid sipper, and clearly a different approach than some more fruit-forward fruit lambics. I'm glad I had a chance to try this.",0.6978515346188873,4.5,0.9937
Sip Of Sunshine,"Canned on 8/8/18  I've tried this one plenty of times before, but finally had the chance to properly review...  Pours a beautiful honey-copper with two fingers of frothy, pillowy white head; decent head retention and plenty of lacing left behind to wall the glass; just a great-looking beer.  Aromas of honeyed grapefruit, earthy pine needles, dank mango peel; the balance of raw hop aromas present is so smooth, verging on almost naturally sweet, and displays excellently the evolving hops on the nose.  Taste is that familiar and smooth honeyed grapefruit along with balanced pine, dank mango notes, and the lightest hints of lemon peel; a bit of grainy malt, light peach skins, and hoppy grit are interspersed, as well. This is remarkable in its consistency from the aroma, and in its smoothness on the palate throughout.   Mouthfeel has everything going for it: smoothness, balance, perfect carbonation and a crisp, juicy finish; this is about as good as it gets.  Understandably a benchmark beer for the style; this has some truly incredible balance and consistency to it throughout, and is an eminently enjoyable drink under nearly any circumstance; it is similarly level-headed and brash, and deserving of its high esteem. A personal favorite for the style.",0.7501343823444264,4.5,0.9937
Beatification,"HUGE thanks to leschkie for this bottle...  Batch 005, split with dogfishandi...  A: Pours a cloudy golden straw with a half finger of pure white head that fades pretty quickly. There is no lacing on my glass as it drinks.  S: The nose is sour grapes, sour cherries, rose hips, brett, green apple, and vinegar. Sour is an understatement for this beer. It's glorious, but it's not for the faint of heart.  T: Damn. It's sweet and tart right up front. From that point on, it's just massive sour. Puckering vinegar, green apple, and artificial sours hit you big time. It's like sipping on a liquefied sour patch kid. It's super drying in the finish, and almost hurts the taste-buds.  M: Medium bodied beer. It's massively sour, super funky, and lingers forever. It almost hurts your mouth, but I'm loving it.  O: Fantastic beer. It's mega sour and super delicious. This is a true standout for wild ale fans. It deserves every bit of praise that it gets. Fantastic.",0.6148626705087668,4.5,0.9937
Sang Noir,"10oz pour into a snifter On tap at the Pour House Channelside, Tampa, FL Vintage 2016  Drank several months ago, but review was live at time of consumption.  A: Very dark red, almost brown (although it is quite dark in here). 1 fingers width of tan lacing with decent retention and tons of lacing. 4.75  S: Sweet, lots of oak, caramel malts, subtle tart. Nice aroma but not huge. 4.25  T: Taste is truly lovely. Tons of dark fruit, nice balancing tartness, oaky. Fantastic mix of sour and sweet dark fruits. Some caramel sweetness. Fantastic. 4.75  M/D: Medium body, carbonation appropriate, ABV exceptionally well masked with excellent drinkability. 5  O: Wonderful beer. Exceptionally done. 4.75",0.6659364173361909,4.75,0.9936
Black Tuesday,"A- Pours lighter than expected, but still damn near black in color. Chocolately brown colors in the body near the edges with a very small head, that is more of a thin film on the top of the beer.  S- Big notes of sweet vanilla and bourbon right up front. The booze hits next on the nose with an oaky spiciness and plenty of heat. Dark malts, including coffee, chocolate, and burnt malts finish out the scent with a sweetness mixing in with oaky spiciness.  T- Starts off with a sweet bang of chocolate and vanilla flavors. Oak flavors and bourbon come next with some burn, but not as much as one would think. Creamy chocolate flavors come right after the burning sensation. Last flavor on the tongue at the end here is a blend of sweet and spicy chocolate and bourbon.  M- Thick, creamy, and boozey all the way through the drink, but surprisingly easy drinking and doesn't quite feel as strong as the label says. This will definitely put you under the table, but is so smooth and silky, it is almost a welcome feeling.  Overall, this is a great beer, but I'm not sure it is worth the price tag and the effort to procure. Still, a great beer that I would seek out and drink again.",0.6676454638344212,4.5,0.9936
Nelson,"22 oz. bottle, best by date May 24, 2016 printed on the label. My second beer from Alpine Beer Company, their highly acclaimed Nelson 'golden rye India pale ale'.  Poured into a Duvel tulip snifter.  A - Bright juicy golden yellow pour, appears adequately carbonated with one finger of frothy white foam head that falls quickly and leaves spotty lacing behind. Looks very nice.  S - A beautiful fresh bouquet greets the senses: fresh, juicy, fruity & floral. Fresh earthy pine hop flowers - mango, grapefruit, white grapes, peach. A very fresh & inviting aroma.  T - Flavor follows the nose: fresh, juicy, fruity, & floral. Crisp, earthy, grassy, piney. Fruity with notes of mango & grapefruit, white grape, peaches. Very juicy and fruity, thanks to the Nelson Sauvin hops. Very delicious stuff.  M - The feel is probably the best part of this beer - dangerously drinkable at 7.00% abv, this thing goes down like a 5.00% session IPA. Juicy & fruity. Floral, with perfect balance. The malts keep the hops from ever becoming too bitter.  Overall, an excellent fresh IPA. Very drinkable & refreshing. Highly recommended.

Enjoy By IPA,"Bottled 3/14/18. BB 4/20/18.  A: pours a bright, brassy gold with 1 finger bright white head and streams of small bubbles visible. Outstanding sheets of lacing.  S: piney citrus. A familiar resinous sweetness, with a lemony, citra undercurrent. Not terribly tropical, just resin and bright citrus.  T: slightly sweet, hoppy arrival. Fruity, juicy, citrusy, white bread middle. Lingering piney citrus hop bite. There's that vaunted dankness! Alcohol is well hidden, and given the highly drinkable texture, that is a dangerous combo.  M: I love the feel of this. Solidly midweight, but really clean, and with enough carbonation to keep it really lively on the tongue.  O: well, that certainly lives up to the hype. It is not really breaking new ground in its hop profile, but it is what I love - a classic style, perfectly executed. Furthermore, in what is kind of an insult to Stone, I think this is a really balanced beer. Certainly dominated by hops, but the sweetness of the malt stops it from being overbearing. Very nice. I'd say I'll buy it again, but I am getting old and can't hang with 9%-plus beers the way I used to. Really happy I finally got around to this.",0.6992306221281585,4.25,0.9936
Haze,"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 3/6/2018. Pours opaquely hazy medium orange/amber color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with amazing retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Thick soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, orange juice, lemon, lime, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, kiwi, guava, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, biscuit, white bread dough, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, grapefruit, orange juice, lemon, lime, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, kiwi, guava, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, biscuit, white bread dough, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very minimal pine, zesty, herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, orange juice, lemon, lime, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, kiwi, guava, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, biscuit, white bread dough, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; very smooth, creamy, silky, and bready mouthfeel that is insane. Light sticky hops and lightly increasing lingering bitter dryness. Minimal warming alcohol for 8.2%. Overall this is an insane NE DIPA! All around amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; very smooth and insanely easy to drink for the ABV; with the minimally bitter/drying finish. Softest of the soft mouthfeel was perfect. Insanely juicy and lightly dank hops; balanced bready malts, not overly sweet/heavy feeling for the ABV.

Mastermind,"12oz. can into a Hop Showers glass.   Pours a foamy, 2 finger white head with excellent retention. Beer is a crystal clear goldenrod. Lacing is layered and thick with great stick. An outstanding looking beer.   Nose has hints of lemon and citrus zest, pine, grass and pineapple. Tropical and juicy but overall pretty mellow.  Opens soft. Hints of papaya and pineapple fortified by a mellow malt body. Some citrus fruit in the middle with a bit of grass and pine in the back. Sweet and juicy end with a bit of a dry, resiny aftertaste. Pretty nice.   Medium bodied with moderate to low carbonation. Slick and quenching in the mouth and soft going down. Mellow finish with a dry, lingering, filmy aftertate. Excellent!   Great balance here and everything from the flavor to the look to the feel is above average. Worth trying but I don't know if its so much better than all the other outstanding offerings in the style that I'd go out of my way for it.",0.7124699841850602,4.25,0.9936

Sip Of Sunshine,"16 oz can packaged 9/16/2016.  Served chilled into a goblet glass, Sip of Sunshine is a slightly hazy golden yellow orange color. The head is thin and settles quickly but leaves some spotty lace.  Aroma is fresh and citrusy with great orange and grapefruit coming through nicely. Also some floral and tropical fruit notes.  Flavor is sweet up front with honey and orange juice. The hop bitterness comes in from middle to end with grapefruit primarily and pine in the background. The flavors play well together and give good balance between sweetness and bitter citrus.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and perfectly carbonated. Very drinkable and impressively balanced for a double IPA.  Overall a fantastic example of an east coast DIPA and I'm very happy to see it in Colorado if even just for GABF 2016.",0.7214154945271054,4.5,0.9935
Swish,"Canned 11/12/16. Consumed 11/19/16.  A: Beer comes in a hazy, very light gold (almost pushing a dark yellow) color. Pretty much full haze on this one—as I’ve come to expect from BB; almost fully opaque. About a half finger of fluffy white head faded quickly to almost nothing, leaving some decent laces on the glass.  S: Sticky, overripe yellow peach, pineapple, and tangerine. Just a touch of lemon zest. There’s a slight underlying herbaceousness—almost like basil, mint, and spruce tips, but nothing too pungent. I also get some armpit-esque dankness; not as unpleasant as my descriptor would indicate, but it's definitely a note that I get from Mosaic-forward beers. Moderate-plus intensity on the aroma--not explosive, but certainly doesn't require any digging.  T: Up front, I get a big smack of lemon-lime—almost like sweet lime juice with a bit of lemon zest. Flavor quickly transitions onto more tropical flavors, following the nose with notes of overripe peach, pineapple, and maybe a hint of sweet citrus. There’s just a touch of semi-sweet, bready, doughy malt mid-palette and that grassy, dank, green hop matter flavor on the back end. Finish is a really awesome balance of lingering tropical fruit juice, lemon-lime zest, and bitter, musty green grass. For 8%, this one really toes the bitter vs. sweet line quite well.  M: Medium mouthfeel with lively, effervescent carbonation. Not as soft and not as creamy as some of the other ‘top’ NE-style DIPAs, which is probably my biggest knock against this beer. There’s a nice smack of medium-plus, aspirin-like bitterness on the finish—I get that same note on The Substance, but with Swish, that sharp, pointy bitterness is offset by a really smooth sweetness that I imagine is coming from the malt backbone. Not even a hint of alcohol heat.  O: This is a really interesting beer and very different from some of the ‘juice bombs’ coming out of NE. Swish stuffs a huge variety of flavor into a very drinkable package, offering those pungent, sticky tropical fruit notes along with some piney, grassy, bitter herbal flavors on the back end. It’s not a one-note beer, and I really appreciate that aspect of it. It it had a fuller, creamier mouthfeel and a bigger nose, this would be up there with the best of ‘em.",0.6961762604653563,4.5,0.9935
Haze," a growler, it pours cloudy yellow gold color that has the classic New England IPA looks. Head was foamy, off white and about 1 finger thick, fading slowly and leaving minimal spotty lacing.  Smells of fresh citrus hops, pineapple, grapefruit, orange peel, lemon zest, mango, dank piney hops, luscious tropical fruit, graham cracker, biscuit, toasted grains and a general lovely fruity sweetness. All hops but just enough malt backbone to make it almost perfectly balanced that hides the ABV perfectly.  Tastes pretty much like it smells but with added citrus fruit like papaya, star fruit, grapes, pear, light peppery spices, some earthy/floral notes and tea leaf. Bitterness is mild and the ABV is completely hidden, making this incredibly easy to drink. Delicious, another well balanced home run by Tree House.  07/08/2019-got a bunch of cans dated 07/02/19 at the brewery on July 6th and this was great so fresh that it validated the original review from October of 2016.",0.6883151715589486,4.75,0.9935
Black Tuesday,"Enjoyed at a bottle share with friends. We had 2010 through 2016, Madeira, rum, and port versions as well as BT Reserve (and I have pictures to prove it). Each was poured from a bottle into a small tasting glass and this review conveys my general impression of the beer after trying all of these. The pour was nearly black, fairly viscous, and sported very little (if any) carbonation. The nose was all dark chocolate, roasted coffee, toasted oak and bourbon.  Full body with a slick, oily feel and a massive, complex flavor. Lots of chocolate up front, coffee, and bourbon. The bourbon intensifies across the palate and adds a tremendous amount of richness to the flavor. The beer is candy-sweet, but not cloying and incredibly drinkable for such a mammoth beer. The alcohol is quite strong, but is well-balanced by the sweet malt and bitter roast. Finishes warm and rich with notes of vanilla, bourbon, toffee, and a little dark fruit.  A beer that drinks like a liqueur. A masterpiece of the brewer's art, no question about it. Insanely rich and flavorful, yet I could easily drink this all night and not get tire of it (at least until I pass out). The base beer must be incredible because I honestly couldn't tell much of a difference between the regular, port, rum, and madeira Black Tuesdays. It all tastes the same to me - unbelievably great.",0.6665052549333031,5.0,0.9934
Black Tuesday,"Truly speaking, words couldn't describe how blissful this beer was, but I'll give them a whirl anyway.  Pours perfectly black with a brilliant tan head on top. It's aroma is rich of roasted malts, bourbon, licorice, leather, all coming together in a wonderful, warm, boozy whiff.  Lot of barrel flavors compliment dense flavors of malts, chocolate, molasses, licorice, and caramel. It is easily one of the best tasting beers I've ever tried. Full bodied with a thick but soft mouthfeel. This is pure bliss in a bottle.",0.6751961929325629,5.0,0.9934
Swish,"Half-pint on tap at Hella Good in Portland, Maine. Served in a mason jar.  Appearance: Pours a cloudy orange-gold with a big frothy white head. Lots of lacing on the way down.  Aroma: Big aromatics here. Hops, grapefruit, pine, citrus, lemon and other traditional IPA aromas. The nose lets you know this is going to be something else.  Taste: Holy moly. What a delicious DIPA. Grapefruit is the dominant flavor, and there's also a sort of pleasant cantaloupe note in there, too. Nice malt base to round it out. Alcohol burn is there. Feels like all of its 8 ABV, to me, though others dissent. This is a great, great bigger IPA.  Mouthfeel: That's the other thing, it's perfectly balanced for the palate as well. Medium-bodied, with terrific depth of flavor. Finishes perfect and dry.  Overall: Wake up to the real deal. If you like hoppy IPAs, you owe it to yourself to find this one. A beer that reminds the imbiber why folks throw praise so liberally at great IPAs - and it's worth every one.",0.6817150522770027,4.75,0.9934
Chocolate Rain,"Shared this bottle with the girlfriend and some friends at Eureka! Burger last night. Pours a thick black color with little to no head. Some tiny brown bubbles. Scent is very sweet and boozy. The booze is very up front in the nose, which quickly switches to sweet chocolate and vanilla. Subtle sweet bourbon aroma with more intensified vanilla. Taste is not nearly as boozy as the nose made it seem. Very sweet though. Intense sweet chocolate and vanilla flavors...like literally eating some rich chocolate cake. I feel like there could have been more barrel flavor to this beer...and possibly a little overly sweet. Mouthfeel is full bodied and syrupy. Drinkability is fair, as long as you are sharing it with a good amount of people. Overall, I enjoyed Black Tuesday a bit more. This is a well-crafted beer that most breweries could not pull off (a 19.5 ABV stout that is drinkable!)...just good in small doses. Glad I tried it. I have one more bottle and need to decide whether to age it longer or trade it.",0.6402834678130861,4.0,0.9934
Peche 'n Brett,"I've been hunting this one for a long time, so it's with great enthusiasm that I review this beer. Poured out of a 750 mL bottle with a wax-dipped neck and cap and marked with an enjoy by date of 01/2019. Served in a Boulevard Smokestack series tulip glass.  Appearance - A beautiful, cloudy amber orange-yellow hue with faint straw highlights in places. Atop the body sits a frothy two-finger head of off white with a yellowish twinge to it. Retention is excellent, taking several minutes to finally dissipate to an uneven layer of flim and pockets of thicker foam across the surface. Sheets of silky lacing remain for awhile before converting to more mottled streaks of sticky deposits on the side of the glass.  Smell - A great blend of ripe, fruity notes from the peaches and the funky twang from the brett. There are more subtle notes of light sourdough, but this one is all fruit and brett. Some musty, barnyard funk and peach pure as well as faint oak tannins and perhaps a kiss of grassy hops providing some balance. Really, just an intoxicatingly good beer--I could sit here and smell it for hours, but then I'd miss out on the...  Taste - Initial explosion of peach flesh and tartness that induces a pinch in the tastebuds at the front of my cheeks and on the tip of my tongue. That initial bit of sour fades away leaving notes of wet hay and funk with an underlying dryness alongside wood and an herbal hop bitterness. There are some white win-like characteristics as well, giving the impression of drinking a fresh-made peach bellini (sparkling wine and peach puree). I can't emphasize enough how much the fresh peaches come through in this beer.  Mouthfeel - Light bodied and moderate-to-high carbonation, providing a dynamic mouthfeel with notes of prickly tartness and a drying finish.  Overall, this is just a fantastic beer. It brings to mind just how disappointing it is that brewing with fresh fruit is such an expensive proposition, because when done well, beers with fresh fruit are hard to beat. This one is no different, and whoever thought of adding that distinctive yeast known as Brettanomyces to a peach-infused beer was a genius. The natural characteristics of the fruit work well with the funk of the brett. I will likely buy this every time I have the opportunity, as it is outstanding.",0.6868111044380141,4.5,0.9934
Black Tuesday,"A-Pours far from what I was expecting. Instead of a pitch black, viscous beer, it pours lighter than I expected. The body looks almost oily. Dark brown and somewhat thin looking but somehow very oily looking as well. Didn't get much head.  S-A giant whiff of boozy bourbon and all sorts of dark, concentrated maltiness. Loads of fudge and brownie. Some dark fruit and more spicy bourbon and even some vanilla.  T-I really have to applaud this beer for its exceptional integration of alcohol. I was expecting a tongue-sizzling wave of booze but it's surprisingly not nearly as aggressive. The bourbon notes are as powerful as in the nose. The fudge and brownie and other chocolate descriptors all flow across the tongue. Light soy sauce. Vanilla attributed to the bourbon. A big dose of dark fruit as well.  M-Oily, like it looks. Obviously hot. Should be far less drinkable. It's intoxicating in more ways than one. It really wraps you in and begs for more sipping. Super sweet and sticky.  O/D-Lucky to try this one. I enjoyed it but was far less enamored than most. I appreciate Black Tuesday's epic delivery but would not consider it to be anyway near one of the best beers I have had.",0.6584256520160803,3.75,0.9934
Swish,"Big thanks to Josh for hooking me up with a fresh 4pk of this.   Cannot read the canning date, but I understand this to be the 11/20 batch. Pint can poured into a tulip at about 46F.   Pours a surprisingly deep honey golden, with just shy of a finger of foamy white head. Body is opaque, with just a hint of translucency.  Nose is what I interpret as Mosaic right off the bat. Sweet, floral, blue and red berry notes, with a good dankness about it, and some layers of honey in there. Big big peach characteristics, some very ripe mango, hints of passionfruit, and some candied orange rind. Maybe even a very subtle mint note. A nice bouquet or fruit and floral.   Palate opens up sweet and dank. Definitely still getting what seems like Mosaic hopping, with notes of papaya, apricot, honey, some mango, berries, and a little thing that comes across as bing cherry. Along side these fruity waves are dank, grassy notes, and sticky hop oils and resin. A soft spoken resinous bitterness presents itself more as pine, rather than grapefruit. The sweet, floral honey flavor threads through the entire experience, lending some sticky sweetness to the palate, offsetting the bitterness and dankness quite well. Dank, floral, hop notes longer on the palate very long into, and after the finish. Sweetness subsides as the finish begins.  Mouthfeel is full, and fairly soft, but not quite pillowy and fluffy. A typical NEDIPA feel, but not quite Tree House fluff. A moderately strong effervescence provides an airy lift, lightening the load a little.   Overall, this is a very hyped up New England IPA. I have been dying to try this for quite some time. While it is an enjoyable offering, I can't say I would wait in a line to get my hands on some. There's a lot of competition out there, and with Tree House and Trillium in the mix, making a world class IPA that people will go out and hunt is a very difficult task. Several years ago, I can see people being blown away by this, but in my opinion, it's an above average New England IPA. Would I drink it again? Yeah, definitely. Would I pay for it? Yeah, I think so. I just wouldn't go out of my way and bend over backwards to try to get it, when I can trade for some Tree House or Trillium. Nevertheless, it's a solid ale, and it's a hell of a lot better than some other local hoppy offerings I've had. I'm gonna go with a solid 4.3 on this one.",0.6657671371040478,4.25,0.9934
Black Tuesday,"Appearance- not as black as I would have expected. Dark brown/ almost red around the edges but not quite motor oil black. Thin slightly off white collar of a head.   Nose- absurdly good. Big bourbon, milk chocolate, sugary sweet molasses, slight oak, slight booze. I could smell this all day long, I wish they made candles with this smell. Really, it's that good.   Taste- holy shit. Absolutely lives up to the hype. That bruery barrel aged flavor you find in brews like melange 3 and bois is here, big time. Huge bourbon and sweet molasses, slight milky chocolate, a little boozy. Really follows suit with the nose. Perfect mouthfeel. Tastes like 10 or 11%, nowhere near 18.9. Booze is well hidden   Overall- I'm glad this lived up to the hype for me. Really a great balanced beer, glad I have more",0.6197768195895822,4.75,0.9934
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Poured into a snifter shared by Cory from Side Project. Got lucky and went back to talk to him about beer for a bit and this VB Assassin and Fuzzy were open.  A - Appearance is just like MD, dark as night with minimal dark mocha foam head that recedes back into the glass. Extremely thick as it pours into the glass. Minimal lacing (small pour)  S - Smell is pretty much like Mornin' Delight in the maple syrup, chocolate, vanilla, coffee. Then the bourbon oak vanilla smell comes through from the barrel. The barrel smell does not at all overpower the base beer.  T - Taste follows the nose with huge notes of maple syrup chocolate coffee goodness. Vanilla notes with oak and bourbon are on the finish. Definitely one of my favorite tasting stouts of all time. This was after BA Abraxas and Vanilla Bean Assassin. I think this was my favorite of the 3.  M - So chewy and delicious. Coats the mouth and stays there  O - From a small pour I was able to tell so much. After having MD i could tell that this was the BA version of that. It is one of the best barrel aged stouts ever brewed.  2014 Gold Wax KBBS poured and split amongst friends  This is pretty similar to 2013 in terms of mouthfeel and barrel character. It doesn't quite have the maple finish that 2013 did but the coffee is definitely better in this years. Decadent smooth creamy mouthfeel, TG nails their mouthfeel in all of their big stouts.   I have to say that this is still my favorite BA Stout that I have had, slightly ahead of DBH, BA Abraxas, BA Coffee Abraxas, PvW Black Magick, BA Lumber. This outshines them all. I wish it wasn't so damn hard to get, but seek this one out in confidence.",0.6099828495150373,5.0,0.9934
Juicy,"375ml bottle, Batch 2, poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass. Enjoyed on 1.16.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal.   The beer pours a copper orange color, light amber, very hazy and cloudy, with an off white head, good retention and great lace. The aroma is fantastic, huge melon hops, bright citrus, tropical fruit, mild funk, chardonnay grapes, cereal grains, lemon zest and soft oak. Even from the nose, Juicy is the most appropriate term to describe this beer. The flavors are fantastic, again, ""juicy"" is the best word, huge melon forward hops, citrus, funk, tropical pineapple, white wine, chewy oak, light pine, wildflower, doughy cereal grains and mineral water. The bitterness is completely absent allowing for a pungent hop flavor with nice funky wine barrel and a great saison base to work in harmony. The mouthfeel is fantastic, thick, coating, creamy, juicy, lively, full bodied with a dry but not unpleasant finish.  Verdict: A stunner from Hill Farmstead. Almost a styleless wonder of a beer, insanely juicy but with delightful funk and wine influences. Balanced to perfection, I'd wager this is a beer best consumed fresh to sufficiently enjoy all that the New Zealand hops have to offer.",0.7018718157392113,4.5,0.9933
Sip Of Sunshine,"An absolute classic, and an appropriate beer to open up with before another Patriots Super Bowl. Canned 12/11/18.  True golden pour, with a nice two finger head of bubbly, frothy foam. It fizzles out slowly, and as it settles some nice amoeba-like patterns of lace cling to the inside of the glass.  Awesome nose on this beer, bursting with sweet grapefruit and balanced with a mellow but present malt bill. Floral, piney hops greet the nose on the back end, serving as the perfect backbone to the aromas.  Man, it’s nice every once in awhile to abandon the haze and enjoy a perfectly executed, hop-forward IPA. Piney, bitter hops come out the gate and cut through more of that lightly malty, citrusy sweetness. Not too bitter, not too hoppy, not too sweet. Just a perfect balance.  Smooth, crisp, and with a perfectly subtle hop tingle. Great weight, and a resinous hop cling in the finish.",0.7009770555901469,4.5,0.9933
Society & Solitude #4,"At the time of this review this is #12 on the "" Top Beers - American Double / Imperial IPA"" list on beeradvocate.com. Served out of a growler (sorry Shaun...not really) into a Hill Farmstead tulip. Don't believe me? Check my twitter. This beer was really good. It was a little sweeter than I expected but a great mouthfeel and a nice finish.   Beer is orangish yellow and mildly hazy with a soft white head, small and large bubbles and some lacing nice retention steady carbonation.   Aroma is light, mildly malty, tropical fruits and sweetness. Nice hops. Very good aroma.   Beer is medium in body and creamy, mildly sweet with a nice finish. Mildly bitter in contrast to the hop profile of tropical fruit and papaya. Mango and other pineapple. I love the beer and has a great finish.",0.6711832638582341,4.5,0.9933
Society & Solitude #4,"Huge thanks to the ever-generous kingkong for the growler. Shared with friends and poured into a Duvel tulip.  A: Cloudy pale orange body under a finger of large-bubbled white froth from a vigorous pour. Not much internally-produced head, but for impact bubbles they stick around well. Very light lace. No better than average.  S: Lovely hop dominance. Quite dank and herbal up front, with citrus and tropical fruit following close behind. Just a hint of toasty malt. Excellent, but not quite room-filling.  T: Spicy, piquant hoppiness right away, with mango, grapefruit, and spruce resin dominant on the middle part. Huge herbal bitterness pounds the back of my tongue throughout the slightly malty finish and persists to the end of the citrusy, almost eternal aftertaste. Super flavorful, but a little shy of truly dynamic.  M: Medium body, light carbonation. Very soft and delicate, but a touch too close to lifeless.  O: Excellent beer, but I enjoyed both Double Citra and Double Galaxy significantly more. Thanks again, Patrick!  Cheers!",0.6980947045784789,4.0,0.9933
Chocolate Rain,"Served on-draught at Beer Belly in Koreatown last night. 19.5% confirmed. Cost was $7.00 USD for an 8 oz pour. Served into a tulip. Expectations were extremely high; I love Black Tuesday. Reviewed from notes.   A: Pours a half finger head of milky light khaki colour. Retains for 1.5 minutes, reducing to a floater ring which itself remains for about 3-4 more minutes. Body colour is an opaque solid black; not quite a jet black but dark. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. I remember Black Tuesday looking far better and richer. Given the gargantuan ABV, I think the head retention is pretty impressive. Pretty good for the style overall.   Sm: The first thing I noticed about the beer when the bartender handed it to me was the aromatic pungent vanilla bean notes. Chocolate, cacao nibs. Dark malts. Molasses. Raisin. Boozy, but nowhere near as much as you'd expect for 19.50%. Caramel. No yeast character is detectable. Syrup. Light vinous notes. Powerful and strong, but not as rich or evocative as I recall Black Tuesday being. A bit disappointin,g but inviting overall. Certainly not alive.   T: Molasses, chocolate malt, dark malts, caramel, raisin. Light vinous character. No roast, to my chagrin. Sweet vanilla bean on the climax; a bit overbearing and creme-brulee esque - definitely too sweet, but not quite cloying. Hot and boozy; it's unpleasant but tolerable. I expected far more from the chocolate/cacao based on the aroma, but it's not rich or high quality at all. Surprisingly shallow depth of flavour. Syrupy and imbalanced. Aside from the alcohol, flavour intensity is actually fairly restrained for the style. No subtlety here at all. Not getting any barrel or wood notes. Average flavour duration.   Mf: Syrupy and thick. Undercarbonated. Smooth and wet. Not at all ideal for the style or flavour profile. Really underwhelming. Average presence on the palate.   Dr: THIS is based on Black Tuesday? THIS is highly sought after and heavily traded? Boy am I disappointed. A boozy mess with lackluster balance and few remarkable characteristics. Honestly, I wouldn't order this again. I'm shocked at its high ratings. Is Grey Monday as mediocre as this? I expected way better having loved Black Tuesday. This emperor has no clothes; I'm sorry for those of you who pay The Bruery exorbitant membership costs just to have the purported privilege of buying bottles of stuff like this. I pray the bottled version is better. I'm almost tempted to figure that the bar didn't serve or store this right, but Beer Belly has quite a good reputation. Wow, I did not see this mediocrity coming. What a waste. Very mundane.   Low C",0.6754193839115803,2.5,0.9933
Chocolate Rain,"2013 vintage. Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Bruery snifter. Acquired in a trade with vitese, thank you as always kind sir.  The pour is a transluscent medium brown, becoming opaque once in the glass, nearly black. The head is unique for a stout of this magnitude.. light mocha brown and 3 fingers in height, but fizzy and effervescent, dissapating quickly to nothing, leaving no retention or lacing.   Aromas a big and upfront, slightly boozy with rich deep vanilla, bourbon, sweet caramel being predominant, milk chocolate syrup is in the background. Very inviting.   First sip and... woah! That's sweet. Liquid diabetes sweet. Sugar coated dark fruits, sweet chocolate syrup, maple candy upfront. The follow through has some roastyness and coffee, but the sweet syrupy nature dominates from start to finish. Aftertaste is slight vanilla and milk chocolate. Slight burn on the way down.   Mouthfeel is rich, but not super thick like you'd expect. It's actually quite drinkable for 18% and has medium carbonation, more than you'd expect.   This is one of those beers that I've been waiting years to try, and I'm glad I got to try it. Not an everyday beer, definitely a dessert beer and definitely a beer to split. Not for those who don't like sweet beers.",0.6510855213870866,4.25,0.9933
Society & Solitude #4,"4 day old Growler brought back by TheSevenDuffs.   A - cloudy copper orange  S - Awesome. A lot of tropical fruits but mango really stands out, some pine notes.   T - Tropical fruit, passion fruit and mango stand out amongst the impressive salvo of fruit flavors, some pine. There is an impressive amount of hop flavour without being over powering and annihilating your palate for anything else you might eat/drink   M - This is the one of the most impressive things about the beer, very dry mouth feel. Lowish carbonation.   O - An amazing beer. Full of delicious hops, fantastic mouth feel. This is one of the best beers I have ever had the good fortune of having.",0.6480734784356245,4.5,0.9933
Nelson,"Poured into a hybrid glass from a 12oz bottle  A - A hazy deep golden straw, with half finger foamy white head and some nice sugar legs  S - A really nice balance of sugar, hops and a slight dry. Pine, pineapple and grapefruit abound! Clean water, lots of sweet malt/grain and just a hint of dry to ""git 'er done"", peach, some nice earthy and sweet yeast notes, floral with a slight dry earth hop and loving the nearly perfect booze.   T - A well rounded IPA. It has the west coast to east coast styles with a touch of the old world, really nice and rounded. Rad booze, slight and yet perfect. Lots of green earth, very bitter grapefruit, nice pine both resin and needle, some peach/nectarine, cracker style yeast and some serious hop/dryness.   M - Full bodied, awesome balance, great complexity, medium plus acidity and medium minus to medium carbonation.  D/O - Maybe one of the most balanced AND easy to drink IPA's I have had in quite a long time. With the ABV, bitterness and sugar it should not be as slammable or crushable as it is, but it is. The hops, water, yeast and malt/grains work so harmoniously. Great with a bacon/tomato/avocado/american cheese omelet, wow!   Final thought - the price point at $15 a sixer makes the a not daily, but worth the price of admission. The 7% ABV is pretty ok and really want to have this on tap again. tap > bottle.",0.6804618449066717,4.5,0.9932
Haze,"16oz tallboy can poured into a snifter glass.  L - True to the name, Haze pours a very hazy, almost opaque orange, with a thin film of pearl-white head that dissipates and leaves some streaking on the glass and surface. The color and opacity resembles freshly squeezed orange juice, in a way.  S - There's a distinct sweetness on the first whiff that reminds me of nectarines and peaches, followed by more subtle notes of papaya and a hint of orange. The sharper citrus notes that are typical of hop bombs are missing, and in its place is a slight touch of honey. As expected, there's a pretty strong earthy dankness backing up all of scents, making for an overall smell that's more warm and comforting than tropical and refreshing like most IPAs. Different, but still very nice.  T - The tropical papaya notes come through pretty clearly on the first sip, which is followed by a slight maltiness. Not the most refreshing or juicy of IPAs, but definitely still very enjoyable. Finished with a strong dash of hop resin, which comes across slightly more bitter than crisp. It has all the right components of a great DIPA, but somehow, it's not making a huge impression on me. Admittedly, this might be because I've been drinking some fantastically fresh IPAs lately (Other Half Stacks on Stacks, Grimm Tesseract, Heady Topper, etc.).  F - Mouthfeel is pretty consistent with all the other characteristics. Moderately fine carbonation brings a spritz that complements the hoppiness, and a slight viscosity of the liquid itself goes along with the smell and look.  O - I can't exactly say I'm disappointed by Haze, since it's still a very good double IPA. Definitely not as impressive as the other Tree House IPA I've had so far though (Bright), and some of its contemporary DIPAs that I mentioned earlier. I would get this again, but there are other beers that I've had before that I'd be more keen on acquiring more of.",0.7089417811394786,4.0,0.9932
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Pours very, very dark, nice mocha head that slowly fades to a ring around the glas. Great big chocolate aroma, dripping with bourbon. Great flavor: lots of chocolate and fudge, bourbon barrel is very prominent but so well integrated. Has a nice short, slightly bitter espresso finish. Rich and creamy, quite full bodied. ABV is pretty well masked. Overall, an excellent BA Imperial Stout, love the 12 oz 4-pack format. Much easier to drink. A bit expensive at $30, but let’s rationalize it... $15 for a bomber and you don’t have to drink the whole thing - not too bad now...  1/24/19 12oz bottle dated 10/18/18 4.5 rating",0.6395249392292299,4.5,0.9932
Oude Geuze Vintage,"April 16, 2002 Vintage Bottle, Sampled October 2007 Pours with a lightly hazy, cherry tinged, light amber color (quite dark for a Gueuze / Lambic) and is crowned by an initially two-finger thick, light tan colored head that is a mix of large and tightly beaded froth that leaves some lacing patterns on the sides of the glass as it recedes. Ah yes, the aroma is just want I need; funky, woody, tart and fruity, it smells oh so good. Aromatic notes of cured leather, ripe plastic (in the process of curing), urea, dried mushrooms and a touch of farmhouse cheese are all noticeable. The aromatic tart notes run the gamut from hints of lactic, acetic, definitely citric, with notes of tart apples, sour grapes and even some touches of tart, exotic fruit. Other aromas of rotting wood, cedar, spicy oak, damp cellars made of stone and thick-amply-aged wood structure add more complexity to the aroma.  Soft and almost creamy up front before the acidity kicks in. The acidity is never hard or overbearing though (which I sometimes like and even crave in a Lambic) and in fact melds quite well with a substantial (for a Lambic) texture & body. The acid is most notably lactic in character, but has touches of citric flavors at times. Notes of crab-apple, un-ripe star-fruit, touches of grapefruit (and even more than that at times) and a green, un-ripened, sauvignon blanc grape flavor add to the fruit component of this beer. Despite the supple texture and heft of this beer it seems quite bone dry. The carbonation, though light for a Gueuze, adds a zesty textured touch of froth to each sip. The flavor is not quite as funky as the aroma was, but this is still quite funk driven. Flavors of woody mushrooms, damp leather in the finish, cherry pits, most definitely musty and even a bit moldy at times. Touches of ephemeral vanilla, butter cream flavors (or is that just evoked from the texture), uriatic acid (cat pee to the layman) and wild flower petals add to the subtle backdrop of this beer. Quite tannic at times, almost coating the mouth, though not the teeth like a very tannic green tea, in light astringency.  I could wish for a bit more carbonation here as I like my Gueuzes to be very effervescent, but this is a damn fine example of the art. Very well blended, very well integrated, there is nothing that is dominant here. I do love a good Lambic, Gueuze especially, and I wish that I had the ability to drink more of these on a regular basis. Almost a bit too refined for my tastes; still rustic though and definitely a finely crafted product, but I think I prefer the regular non-vintage, and the 1995 vintage that I had in 2001.",0.6973046578198631,4.5,0.9932
Society & Solitude #4,"750 growler filled the other weekend, poured into HF bulb glass.  A. Large foamy white head with really nice lacing. Body is a hazy orange with some carbonation bubbling up. Looks pretty nice.  S. Big time sweet fruits. Grapefruit, pineapple, mango and orange and a subtle earthy green bitterness.   T. Obviously very hoppy. Sweet citrus melds nicely with the bitterness from front to back. Sweet pink grapefruit gets me initially along with an array of nice tropical fruits. Next comes a quick jab of bitterness that packs a punch. The finish is a nice balance of hops and sweet fruit that leads to a lingering citrus and pine taste. Awesome IPA.   M. Mediumish mouthfeel which is nice. Many of the big DIPAs ive had lately have been big thick and syrupy, this feels nice. Carbonation is smaller bubbles and a low to medium low amount. Feel is pretty much spot on.  O. This is a fantastic IPA, the flavor really takes the cake with this beer. Perfectly balanced between bold sweetness and bitterness. Everything else was spectacular as well. Another top notch brew from Hill Farmstead.",0.7053553891834854,4.5,0.9932
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"375ml bottle, 2016 vintage, poured into a 14oz snifter glass. Enjoyed on 4.11.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal.  The beer pours a nice jet black color, very oily and inky and viscous with a finger of tan head, good retention and spotted lace. The aroma is very nice, lots of coffee, smooth roast profile, rich and inviting with a hint of nice acidity, plenty of dark grain and bittersweet chocolate with soft bourbon a touch of oaky barrel and some strong molasses character. The flavors are good, lots of chocolate and smooth barrel character up front, supportive coffee bean, with some nice richness but also some good counterbalancing fruit flavors and light acidity, molasses and alcohol clean up the finish. The mouthfeel is good, very coating, massively huge body, viscous and thick, chewy almost with a smooth finish.  Verdict: A very nice beer from Jackie O's. Smooth, rich, excellent expression from the coffee. I don't love the molasses flavor I keep getting and it's a hint on the warm and boozy side, but small knocks aside, this was an extremely worthy beer.",0.7044047894361735,4.0,0.9932
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"I'm pretty glad I've long avoided the temptation to drop the $$ that it takes for this bottle. Jeff found a small stock of 2005's and decided to bring one over, and I am very much obliged. 5-6 oz. poured into a FFF Teku on June 9th, 2012.   A Sort of a cross between Raspberry Tart and Lou Pepe Kriek. Similar brown and reddish coloring but with a more pinkish head. One finger reduced down very quickly. Okay lacing, very little legs.  S - Rounded Brett funk of grass, hay, and some barnyard. You can tell that the cherries have mellowed a bit over time and now have a relaxed interplay. That being said, the fruit can be pulled out pretty easily with some room to breathe.  T - Very tart, acedic cherries and pits. Somewhat vinegary, lemon peel bite. Really no sweetness or added spice complexity to back this one. It seems to have fully melded into a sour bomb and is nearly beyond Fou Foune at this point.  M - Light body, great carbonation for the seven years it's spent in the bottle. Infinitely dry, effervescent finish. Fairly perfect.   D - I do enjoy this, but I think less age may be the way to go based on my best guess. With the cherries really being the emphasis, you need to allow that fruit to exhibit its full potential. Alas, it's definitely a treat of a lambic and a cool step back in time.",0.6479789500554582,4.0,0.9932
Beatification,"huge thanks to dolfan54fl, can't thank you enough. This has been one of my top wants. 375ml bottle Batch #5, poured into wine glass. Tasted about a hour after having supplication. Cork removes with nice loud ""pop"".  A- Pours a slightly hazy translucent yellowish golden, above average carbonation- a lot of fast rising carbonation bubbles of all diffferent sizes, thin layer of white head (about a half finger) that recedes to leave almost no head.  S- Lots of sour funk. Sour cherries, sour lemons, vinegar, a little bit of hay, barnyard funk, sweaty gym clothes, etc. Very aromatic, could smell when the cork popped and while it is sitting next to me.  T- Sour cherries, sour green apples, a little bit of hay, finishes with a nice sour, tart green apple taste. Leaves a very nice sour green apple aftertaste that lingers for awhile inside the mouth and the lips. A little bit more vinegar/acidic tasting towards bottom of glass. So much flavor packed into this beer that even the last drop cloying to the bottom of the glass + bottle is exploding with a multitude of flavors. Never had a beer that played with the taste buds so much. Only complaint is that at times it was almost too vinegary/acidic and could have been balanced a tiny bit better. Overall though one of the best tasting beers I've had.  M- Light, crisp, refreshing, perfect carbonation to complement the sourness, very easy to drink.  O- This was an awesome beer, probably one of the best I've had. The taste and aroma are right up there with some of the best sours including the Cantillons. I definitely enjoyed this a lot more then the Supplication I had earlier, a lot more funk, more citrusy, and more overall flavor etc.. Definitely a must try if you are into sours. Wish the brewery was on the East Coast.",0.6572755949245312,4.5,0.9931
Todd The Axe Man,"Got in a trade with The-Adjunct-Hippie. 16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 11/16/2016. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy golden amber/light orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Good appearance. Aromas of huge tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon zest, orange peel, berry, light pepper, pine, honey, biscuit, light caramel, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon zest, orange peel, berry, light pepper, pine, honey, biscuit, light caramel, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine, citrus peel, herbal, spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon/orange rind, pepper, pine, honey, biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and minimal lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp/sticky/resinous, and grainy/bready balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 7.2%. Overall this is an amazing IPA! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and easy to drink for the ABV.

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"The beer pours a nice and good looking fluffy brown head that dissipates quickly while the beer itself is a very good looking dark chocolate black. The texture still has the good looking heft but now has a nice looking sheen from the bourbon barrel aging.  The smell is very good. IT has a good and upfront bourbon note that mixes well with the cocoa notes and a bit of charred wood to it underneath the rest of the bourbon.  The taste is also very good. It has a strong upfront bourbon note mixed with some good wood notes and a bit of cocoa to it.  The feel is good. It's a heavy body but with a very smooth and well polished body.  Overall, this is another really good beer worth getting. While it isn't super intense, it definitely can stand up to other similar stouts because of how well balanced it is.",0.6805112125413811,4.5,0.9931
Blanc De Blancs,"e into a tasting glass, reviewed from notes. Thanks Aaron!  A: Hazy deep gold body under a finger of white froth. Mediocre retention and lacing, which is better than I expected for the style. Pretty nice.  S: Intense. Huge citric acidity is front and center, with waves of lemon, lime, grapeskin, and passionfruit. Some sweeter grape and melon notes emerge as it warms, as well as more than a hint of vanilla oak. Excellent.  T: Even better than the nose, with immense flavor and complexity without any loss of balance. Sour fruitiness up front, rich oak underneath, and a long, tart, drying finish with a lovely vinous aftertaste. Wow.  M: Substantial body with light, soft carbonation. Lively enough to keep it from being the least bit sticky, but not too prickly. Solid.  O: Amazing beer, and probably my favorite Side Project to date. Huge thanks to Aaron for hosting the share with this and so many other wonderful brews.  Cheers!",0.7066102291224696,4.5,0.9931
Beatification,"Batch 005, big, big thanks to Tim for pulling this one out of the cellar and sharing it. Definitely a nice surprise. Pours a somewhat dull, golden-yellow blend with a mild chill haze, leaving the beer translucent with very mild clarity. The small, eggshell colored head builds up to almost a half-inch before quickly fizzling away into thin air.  Just from the aroma, I can already tell that this is gonna be one tart and sour MF'er. I bring my nose to the glass and my nostrils are immediately assaulted by an army of acidic and tart aromas; pure lactic acid in a glass. I'm kidding... But, seriously. Green apples, grapes, cherries, tart vinegar, mild oak, and a light but noticeable funk in the background. Probably one of the most sour ""smelling"" beers I've had the pleasure of sniffing, so I can only imagine how this one is going to taste. It's already got my saliva glands bubbling.  The taste is a brilliant collaboration of everything picked up on the nose, only amplified about a hundred times - extremely fruity and zesty. It's super sour and extremely tart, right from the beginning. Definitely one of the biggest lip-smacking, puckering beers I've had. Juicy, sour apples, lemon juice, white grapes. Huge acidity with heaps of vinous and vinegar flavors. Every single nook and cranny of my mouth is coated with this incredibly sour flavor. It's got me salivating like Pavlov's fucking dog over here. Some light wood and oak comes into the beer near the end and into the aftertaste, along with a light bit of funk, yeast, and musk. Thin-medium bodied with a huge bout of carbonation.  Whew! Now that's a sour beer. Huge sour flavors - so incredibly tart and puckering. Suck a lemon or drink pure lactic acid and you're right on par with Beatification. Nice little addition of funky and Brett notes, too. Thanks again to Tim for breaking this one out, it was incredible.  EDIT: 5/12/2013  Had an earlier batch at Jeff's house (thanks, Jeff!) and this stuff was even better than I remembered. So impossibly sour and so incredibly drinkable. I've never been more sad to see an empty glass.",0.6570679901381031,4.75,0.9931
Madagascar,"A- Pitch black as the Night King's soul pour with a tan-brown cap. The head has a creamy and foamy texture and peaks at about 2 fingers high with good retention. A ring at the edges leaves a few webs of lace.  S- The beer's name is 100% appropriate as vanilla beans really pop off in the aroma but don't overshadow the great stout beneath and it comes off as high quality and authentic. Luscious vanilla bean leads into dark chocolate, fudge, milk chocolate, licorice, burnt barley, coffee, marshmallow and suggestions of a moderate sweetness. The bourbon barrel melds with the vanilla here but some spicy whiskey hints here and there.  T- Gains some traction in terms of balance compared to the aroma as the underlying grain bill and the barrel gain strength in comparison to the huge vanilla beans. The beer is fairly sweet but nowhere near cloying and again balanced overall. Fresh vanilla bean, brownies, dark chocolate, toasted marshmallow, espresso and roast barley lead into caramel, spicy bourbon whiskey, booze, raisin, toast, toffee, fig and slight licorice hints. Complex and balanced despite having a ton of vanilla flavor radiating throughout.  MF- Medium-heavy bodied straying toward the former. Definitely on the thinner side for a stout with a ton of rich dessert-like flavors but steady enough to support them. The texture is creamy and silky and it ends fairly warm for the ABV.  If you like vanilla beans you should go out and find this beer ASAP. This beer captures a massive amount of vanilla bean flavor while still showcasing great roast grains and a bourbon barrel underneath. A wonderful compliment to the battle for Winterfell.",0.6857160125630783,4.75,0.9931
Sip Of Sunshine,"Ah finally. Sip of Sunshine. This review is for my all of fans who have been liking my reviews and liking my posts. You make me feel extra special and extremely helpful in the beer community. Knowledge is power!  This beer pours a lovely golden sunset color with a huge bubbly head with lots of lace left behind. Haze is apparent but not dominant.   A delicious aroma of melon, cantaloupe, oranges, and grapefruit, and vanilla soft serve. Just wow.   Flavor is extremely resinous to start, followed by a rich biscuit malt character that follows through to the finish, with orange, lemon, cantaloupe, white grape, and tangelo. Very tasty. Love the dry resins that follow through to the finish. Although it's not quite as pleasing as the aroma, the flavor is nothing to shake your head at.  Feel is crisp, smooth, and creamy. Just a hint creamier and it would be perfect.   Overall, Sip is a great beer that I'll definitely try to acquire more of. If you get a chance definitely snag it. Nice cohumulone content and nice alpha acid presence. Hazy, not juicy, but resiny and delicious.",0.6956064072075488,4.5,0.9931
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Look: Pitch black, not a huge head but good retention and even better lacing.  Smell: Beautiful. Oak (and I mean a lot of oak), some coffee, some bourbon, and some dark chocolate. Can't ask for more here.  Taste: Wow. This is the best Jackie O's I've had so far--and they have some really, really good dark beers. The coffee is out in front, but the bourbon and chocolate are strong.   Mouthfeel: Alcohol well concealed. Smooth. Way too drinkable. Can't believe this is 12%. Reminds me of KBS, but maybe actually better in this area.  Overall: This is expensive, but I'm not at all disappointed. This is near perfect and my only disappointment is that the store had a one bottle limit. Absolutely incredible.",0.6382626163398079,4.75,0.9931
Beatification,"Reviewing Beatification from the Russian River Brewing Company. A big thanks to Matt for hooking me up with this one!  Score: 98  Batch 5. Bottled on 01/10/12, served in a Hill Farmstead stemmed snifter and enjoyed on 010/19/12.  Appearance: Pours a nice mimosa-orange color that is on the opaque side of transparent with a half finger of fizzy white head that settles to a pencil thin ring around the glass that ultimately settles completely. Okay lacing, but not a whole lot of retention. 4/5  Smell: Very tart lemon juice hits upfront. Then there is a nice medley of sweet cole slaw vinegar, white grapes, oranges, granny-smith apples, sour peaches, ""lacto-ey yogurt and brett"" and a hint of oak. There is a very faint band-aid funkiness, but it's quite subtle. 4.75/5  Taste: Whoa! Tons of pucker-inducing tart lemon juice upfront, with more funkiness on the back half than the nose nose led on -- but it's really well incorporated into a sweet citrusy mix of flavors so it never overwhelms and merely complements the flavors of the beer. Tart white grapes, tangerines and sweet vinegar on the midpalate, with granny-smith apples towards the finish. ""Lacto-ey yogurt,"" lemon and a hint of banana round off the finish and linger well past the swallow. Very gueuze-esque in flavor. Different than, but just as good as, Consecration in my opinion. 5/5  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation that really accents the zesty tartness of the beer on the center of the tongue. Dry finish, but juicy on the palate. Has a decent amount of pucker. 5/5  Overall: Another outstanding, world class sour from Russian River. This one lives up to its hype, but for its difficulty to acquire, I probably prefer an in-season Consecration.  Recommendation: Seek this one out -- it is truly world class.  Pairings: Monterrey jack cheese wedges and sociables.  Cost: $15 for a 375ml bottle.",0.6624569092320662,5.0,0.993
Sip Of Sunshine,"I've had this a few times, but this one comes courtesy of Smanson56. 16oz can poured into 12oz tulip. Poured a clean, clear gold color with about an inch of white head that had very good retention and lacing.  The aroma is certainly hop forward, lots of crisp citrus and some pine mostly, with just a bit of grainy malt showing through in support. Very similar, just better defined, on the tongue.  The body was just on the light side of medium, with a bit of sweetness at the back, yet still had a dry finish. Drinkability is off-the-charts great, I would be drilling these regularly if available to me. Overall, a great brew. Must-try if you get the chance.",0.6855530463460484,5.0,0.993
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"This is the beer that I always thought Morning Delight should be - the maple syrup is prominent in the nose and taste, but not so forward and overwhelming that it becomes a bit cloying and unpleasant. The barrel is a bit subdued, but still comes through clearly.  KBBS is a once in a lifetime beer that I am sure I'll be chasing for a while now. As I shared this bottle with five friends, I only received about a two ounce pour - which I nursed for a bit and smelled more than tasted. It's so sweet that I think it is best enjoyed as well - let it warm up, let the oily texture because a little more fluid. It's a tremendous beer and best enjoyed very slowly.",0.611075715134431,5.0,0.993
Oude Geuze Vintage,"April 8, 2011: I shared a bottle with Mike, Paul, & Brad @ Brad's place.  2005 Vintage (red label)  Wow, this beer was unbelievable. The aroma and flavor were simply world class, and markedly improved from what I remember. Shockingly good. A must have if you are fond of the style.  *** Original review September 29, 2010 ***  Bottle shared by drabmuh. Thanks Matt!  2006 vintage  A: This beer is a yellowish color, slightly hazy, with a white fizzy head that fades rapidly, leaving no lacing,  S: I would like to quote Paul here: ""This beer smells like a nun's crotch"" Um...I'll take your word for it. Pleasant notes of funk, hay, wild yeast. Smells very nice.  T: A very tasty example of the style. The beer is sour, but not as much as I expected. It's quite pleasant and drinkable. There is subtle acetic or vinegar-like note in the finish. I would be more tolerant of this if the beer was more tart / sour overall. There are delicate hints of fruit in the nose and flavor that I find quite pleasant. A very piquant offering from a world class brewery.  M: Fairly low carbonation. Very smooth on the palate.  D: Quite drinkable and enjoyable. I'm happy that I had the opportunity to taste it. Recommended.",0.653261791310911,4.5,0.993
Sang Noir,"2012 project poured into a 6oz curved glass. Initially this was going to be a gusher but I plugged and lost nothing.   A: Pours a rust brown. Nice deep red pinot character. Lovely frothy head. As far as sours go this is tits. This is exactly what a sour should look like.  S: Nice deep cherry character. Sweet but subtle tannin character. Little bit of chared barrels from the whiskey but so subtle.  T: What can I say? Deep cherry, tart raspberry, sweet booze from the bourbon but not a bourbon burn. The lactic component comes in during the finish with a lingering wood stickiness that just coats the roof of your mouth. Lovely. Not overly sour just the perfect amount.  M: Perfection. Start to finish. Goes down buttery. The carbonation is a little explosive at first but it really enhances the flavor profile. Just frothy clean finish. Some of Cascades can come off overly acidic and this blend is so enjoyable.  Overall: Cascade.. probably the most consistent sour producing brewery out there. I've had this in the past and prior I got more of a sour bomb with heavier lactic component. This is still amazing, hasn't changed much. This goes in the top 5 Flanders Reds I've ever had. Pairs amazingly with a cave aged gruyere.",0.7002959190003322,4.5,0.993
Society & Solitude #4,"From 07/23/12 notes. Had on tap at The Pony Bar in New York at their UES location. Had 2 8 oz. pours of this because it was great.  a - Pours a hazy golden yellow color with one inch of bright white head and moderate carbonation evident. Looks pretty good.  s - Smells of citrus hops, pine hops, grapefruit, oranges, floral hops, and some fruity malts. Just a ton of wonderful fresh citrus and pine hops. The nose is just about perfect and what you'd want in a big hoppy DIPA.  t - Tastes of citrus hops, lemon, grapefruit, oranges, pine hops, and floral hops. There is more orange and lemon than the nose and less pine hops, with some moderate bitterness, but not a ton. Amazing taste again, though the nose is a tiny bit better.  m - Light to medium body and moderate carbonation evident. Body has some moderate bitterness.  o - Overall I thought this was a fantastic DIPA, and it is probably my favorite Hill Farmstead beer, which is saying a lot as I love this brewery. The nose is perfect and the taste is great, both with a ton of citrus and pine hops. Easy to drink two glasses of, would love to get it again.",0.6583739620978254,4.5,0.9929
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"On tap at Nova Res Cafe in Portland. Served in a bowl-ish Pinot wine glass.  Very streamlined presentation in the wine glass. Body is light raspberry red - almost glistening with a fair amount of pinkish or rose carbonation. Head is rather minimalist. Just what the doctor ordered.  Beautifully funky scent of sour, unsweetened raspberries mixed with a great Brett-ish funk. Not so heavy on the blunt horse blanket scent but more of a light poignancy with a little pine thrown in.  Taste profile is extremely clean. The tight sourness mixes nicely with raspberry essence to produce a beautiful lambic here. Finish is still very tight from piney texture and barrel character - almost as dry as balsa wood, but this is one of the classics.  Palate feel makes one pucker. Of course the sourness is overwhelming but it's done in a very clean and tight manner and doesn't negate the light dry sweetness of the raspberries. This one has a great deal of spring in its step.  I've taken a shine to the Cantillon lambics on tap ever since experiencing Fou Fonne at Deep Ellum. This one is just as enjoyable - maybe even a little more fruit character. Sure, it's tight and the funk and acidity slow it down a little bit, but who's to argue that this isn't one of the best?",0.7167811577979677,4.0,0.9929
Sip Of Sunshine,"This is a well named beer. It's bright, cheery and warming like drinking in a sunny day. Nice frothy head of a couple of fingers that fade a little quickly and leaves some nice lacing. The liquid itself is a hazy golden orange that seems to glow as I hold it up.   The nose is a complete caribbean vacation in a glass. Mangos, pineapples, guavas and a citrus forrest with a light bed of pine needles that has just been lightly squeezed by the hand of God after a light rain. A light peppery burn if I inhale quickly and light sweet notes. Think crescent dinner rolls with a touch of honey. Clean yeast firms up the bread a bit. No indication of the abv.   Taste is a joy and a build on the aroma. Big tropics up front that just take you back to the fruit market of the nose. Malt slips in a bready undercurrent that takes you from tropical fruit to lupin pucker. My mouth is coated in hop oil and drying astringency, and yet it does it in a way that controls the bitterness. The back is firm and hop oily, the finish long and bitter with a light mintiness that no doubt is brought out by the invisible alcohol. A bit of multigrain toast and grapefruit skin linger.  Feel is a calling card here. Creamy and crisp at the same time. Lovely weight that is lighter than a beer of this OG should be, at the same time rewarding to keep in your mouth, swish around, and delight in the viscosity.   This is a beer that is exceptional in its drinkability. There is an ease to every swallow that encourages you to session a beer that should be consumed with caution. It makes me smile with each sip and want more and more. In a style that is overgrown with entries this one stands out. Great brew!",0.6684356425001448,4.5,0.9928
Sip Of Sunshine,"Picked up in VT, was canned almost exactly two weeks prior to purchase given date on bottom, enjoyed same day.  Poured into a glass, fairly translucent golden amber yellow colour. Slightly opaque, holding the glass up to the lamp, can see plenty of fine particulates in suspension; unfiltered, like other fine VT IPAs. Nice white, foamy cap of frothy head. Good lacing.  Aroma is wonderful: citrus, slightly piney/resinous quality, mango, lots of fresh hops. I don't notice as much of the floral scent, but that's just me. Very clean.  Clean, crisp blast of citrusy goodness, some tropical fruit character, perfect level of hopping -- initially fruity, then smoothly bitter, then a bit of maltiness (not cloying at all), then a long pleasant lingering bitterness in the finish. This is one smooth and incredibly well-balanced beer. Seems like a bit more going on than most DIPAs I've had. Just enough carbonation to add a little lift to the moderate body. Even the can looks neat and unique.  SoS and Focal Banger are my two all-time favourite Vermont IPAs. This one is slightly mellower but loaded with flavour and a superbly crafted beer. It really is as wonderful as the reviews suggest, just wish availability was slightly better.",0.7204848065851842,4.75,0.9928
Fort Point Pale Ale,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass, sure why not. Canned July 24th 2018.  Quit a good soapy three finger bubbly head that dissolves and pops with quite a bit of gusto. Opaque dark lemon yellow to hinting orange body color, not quite full turbid character but also with a nice glow.  Very nice aromatic nose. Light malts with a touch of crispy brown sugar, mixing with a very noticeable tropical hop angle of mostly pineapple. Soft possible sensing body, with an excellent sugary quality that isn't overbearing. Quite nice.  Palate is very solid. Light bodied even for a pale ale, but just flirts with wetness in mouthfeel and inching to a chalk aftertaste. Base flavors are very good, a rich light almost crusty character with mixing pineapple and touches of light pine. Finishes about the same aromatically but goes almost weak mint and earth rich on the aftertaste.  Very solid new age pale, staying in both ground places, but also flirts with a little baby aspirin as well. Very drinkable and still enjoyable.",0.7065187297038914,4.0,0.9928
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Shared with Klym 750ml vintage 2008  Poured into Lost Abbey Tulip.  A: Fluffy rose pedal bubbles rise like cupcakes over the red valentine body of love. Very pretty looking beer, with a dainty femininity to it. Pinks and reds, like a sappy love letter. I think I'm in love. Really though, this is truly a great looking beer, I didn't know bubbles could be so pink. I could see some high class drinking sessions where everybody is looking dapper in suits while sipping on this cotton candy headed brew.   S: Some earthy dirt covered raspberries with some dusty leathers. The leathers smell sweet, like a dessert wine was spilled all over them. I take that back, the leather is literally soaked in muscat grape wines. A little bit of tart raspberry/cherry creeps up the nostrils. Really very subtlely woody and rosey throughout, a soft berry sniffer. The earthiness and berry-ness are intertwined.   T: Dusty rustic raspberries with tart juices instead of sweet ones. Not overly bitter in the tartness, but very puckeringly dry. Some oak dust rests on these tart berries like garnish of contrast. The dryness rushes in to leave you with a very raspberry like texture in the mouth. You really get the sensation like you are eating the manliest earthy raspberries, no real sweetness, just tartness and dirt. Not so much leather in the taste, as I think the sourness takes a flamethrower to any remaining subtle flavors.   M: This has almost no sensation of bubbles, but the body is solidly of a medium grade. There's a texture to the mouth that isn't so unlike the little hairy seeds on fresh organic raspberries. Soft and dry, but a very fine sensation of textured raspberries/blackberries/othersimilarlookingberries remains my final say. It's dry, but no cottonmouth.  O: Cantillon gives me an interesting framboise, but not one that's really that good. Earthiness instead of sweetness? Sounds fine to me; leather in the nose? Awesome....but this is a framboise where raspberries should reign supreme. The raspberries may have reigned over this bottle at some point, but honestly the sensations of tartness and eventually sourness overwhelmed a subtle berry note. The beer looks and feels of quality; it even smelled of a promising interpretation. However, the taste ultimately is dominated by sensations rather than flavors. Perhaps my bottle wasn't the best, but it was by no means compromised beyond reason. If I was to just see someone drinking this beer I'd have been infinitely jealous; having tasted it: not so much. The visual and smells keep this in the realm of respectability.",0.6581344158933778,4.0,0.9927
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Initially listed this review under the Kriek by accident. Phew.  2007 Vintage, Bottled September 2009  When I first breached the cork there was loads of vinegar to be smelt.  Red colour. Not much head but there's ample carbonation.  Smell is field and wild and cooked mushrooms. Very pleasant funk to this one, nothing potentially disagreeable in here. Does remind me a bit of Lindemans sweetened Lambics in the nose profile though. There's lemon and herbs and really savoury vegetables. Ripe/overripe/fermenting fruit. Honeycomb, malt and carob. Cherries and roses. Smell does get a bit more faecal and organic as I get down the bottle.  Taste is more mushrooms and sweet potato. A pleasant sourness with the tiniest sweet touch. Not cloying at all in either direction. Something about this beer makes me think of regional French cooking, in a really good way. It's like there's garlic in the nose and taste. This beer is deeply interesting.  Mouthfeel is nice. Bubbly and tickly.  I was a bit put off initially by the nose profile but lying behind it is a delicious, drinkable and complex beer. I would love to get more of this.",0.6643616937671677,4.0,0.9927
Peche 'n Brett,"Pours a very cloudy, dark golden orange color with orange/tangerine edges and a one finger white head that slowly settles into a thick, lasting ring.  Spotty lacing left behind.    Musty brett aroma with some barrel and a boat load of luscious organic peach.  Farmhouse yeast and musty funk in the nose with dry brett, damp wood and a very prominent peach presence.  Nice fruited saison.  The brett really stands out after it warms and is nicely complimented by the oak.  The peach character is dominant but doesn't smell artificial nor is it overpowering.  Nice balance of different characteristics in the nose.   Medium bodied with a prominent musty brett character along with dry oak and sour peach.  The dry brett flavor is really strong with musty funk perfectly complimenting the farmhouse yeast.  Oak is dry/toasted but blends nicely with the bugs and funky yeast notes.  Peaches come in at the end with a luscious organic feel.  Not cloying or overly sweet with some sour acidity lingering in the finish. Slightly puckering with pit and fleshy fruit flavor.  Very complex but it's one of most balanced beers I've ever had.  Flavor and mouthfeel are nearly perfect.  I wasn't a fan of regular Seizoen or Seizoen Bretta but I highly recommend doing whatever it takes to try this one.",0.7065068528347707,4.5,0.9927
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"I drank this 2005 vintage from the bottle into a champagne glass.  This lambic pours a medium pink/violet with about 2 inches of light pink head. The retention is poor as it falls within a minute. The lacing is light and watery.   The aroma is wonderful. There is the great funky horse blanket similar to what you get with the Saint Lamvinus, but this is far superior to the SL because it rewards you with great notes of sweet raspberries to balance out the tart.  The taste is also equally balanced rewarding the drinker with tartness and just enough sweetnes that a true lambic follower is looking for to enhance the drinkability. The first sip is lightly sweet with a raspberries and finishes with lots of sourness.   The mouthfeel is heavy and full and coats your mouth and makes you pucker.  Because this is so balanced its exceedingly drinkable for something so tart.  Overall, this is a great beer. I would seek this out and cellar it for up 20 years as recommended on the bottle.",0.6892663793021387,4.0,0.9927
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"5600th review! 12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 6/2/2017. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy dark tan head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, molasses, fudge, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, marshmallow cream, biscuit, dark bread, and roasted nuts; with lighter notes of licorice, cherry, raisin, fig, date, coconut, smoke, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of dark/roast/bready malts and bourbon barrel notes; with big strength. Taste of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, molasses, fudge, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, marshmallow cream, biscuit, dark bread, and roasted nuts; with lighter notes of licorice, cherry, raisin, fig, date, coconut, smoke, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Light roasted bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, molasses, fudge, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, marshmallow cream, biscuit, dark bread, roasted nuts, light licorice/dark fruits, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts and bourbon barrel flavors; with an amazing roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance, with zero cloying/acrid flavors after the finish. Very slight dryness from bitter/oak spiciness as well. Light-medium carbonation and very full body; with a very smooth, creamy, silky, velvety, and slightly chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is insane. Alcohol is extremely well hidden; a mildly increasing warmth of 12.8%, with zero barrel booziness lingering after the finish. Overall this is a world class barrel aged Russian imperial stout! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV. Definitively a great improvement over the base beer, which is already a top style favorite. Same huge, rich, and complex malt body; with perfect barrel integration across the board. Also extremely less bitter; hardly any charred roast and earthy hop notes. A lot smoother/silkier and far less drying. An insanely amazing offering, and top tier style example.",0.6803155217508366,5.0,0.9927
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"I saved this one to log as my 1,500th review. Big thanks to jcvanderbilt for the trade. Pours a bright juicy reddish pink with nice clarity and minimal head. The nose is unbelievable. Full of jammy raspberries, a hint of earth, layers of signature Cantillon funk, a hint of vinegar and oak, but mainly ripe fresh berries. I could smell this all day! The taste lives up to the delightful smell with fresh juicy berries, waves of tartness which are counterbalanced with sweetness. Each flavor pops as this is the tastiest lambic I have ever had the pleasure of trying. Mouthfeel is light with high carbonation. Overall, this beer is fantastic. Definitely the best of the loons I have tried and one that I will have to seek out again.",0.6865460215600234,5.0,0.9927

Dragonsaddle,"L - not so sure about this label. Muscular humanoid topless dragon with a classic male stripper bow tie... and that's it. But then he's got a guitar in one hand and a wizard RPG character riding him. I have no idea. Pours a neon radioactive grassy orange green right out of the can. Damn! Murky, swampy... the color of dragon scales?  S - monstrously bright and fresh. Dank citrus, candied tangerines. Sticky melon and herbal character... like tea? Orange... smells like glowing. Smells juicy as shit, honestly. TIPAs tend to lean more toward strong ale territory.  T - bright mango juicebomb punch up front. Sweet without being cloying, candy without the sugar. Honeydew and orange city. Breaks into light grassiness complemented by guava. Earthy dankness and sticky crabgrass. Slightest twang of a pointed crackery malt. Not much but it's there! No way is this 128 IBU. Hardly any bitterness, but I do get a tingling novocaine numbing when all is said and done! That's the good stuff right there.   F - smooth as butter. Low carb and slight syrup, but surprisingly light for the boozebomb this is. Drinks way too easily.   O - the hype is real. Outstanding TIPA in that it's not a boozey malt-forward strong ale. A lot of high grav IPAs toe that line, but this one sticks firmly in the fresh citrus hop territory. Super juicy and right up my alley. (Hopefully yours too.)",0.6639841552182574,4.75,0.9927
Haze,"Can dated 9/14/17 - about 6 weeks old, which may influence the review (i.e. hop flavor has faded a bit)  Pours a very cloudy, vibrant orange-gold color with a 2 finger fluffy head that leaves nice lacing as it dies down.  Aroma has fragrant notes of orange and nectarine and some pine, not too strong but very present. As it warms up a little more alcohol comes through on the nose.  The taste follows the smell closely with the hop flavor up front giving way to a light maltiness midway through and finishing off with a nice buzz on the tongue with a bit of tartness and residual sweet hop. The flavor has a little white pepper to it as well.  The feel is smooth and soft with a little seltzer. It is a little sticky on the lips as well.  Clearly a great NEIPA. The tartness is an interesting take on it and definitely works well. There are many other NEIPAs I would be happier to have before this one but I wouldn't kick it out of bed by any measure.",0.6699439028395787,4.25,0.9926
Oude Geuze Vintage,"The more gueuzes I drink, the more I learn about structure, balance, nuance and drinkability. A wonderful beer shared generously by my friend Brian. Bottled April 13, 2002, this beer is over 8 years old at this point.  Hazy orange with a dense white head with great retention and lacing. As with almost all 3F gueuzes, carbonation is high, which coincidentally caused the cork to shoot out of the bottle the minute the cage was taken off. And surprisingly enough, the beer did not gush. Bottle conditioning is an art, and some American brewers should pay attention.  The nose is wonderful. One of the best beers I've ever smelled, it reminds me immediately of the 1999 vintage Oude Gueuze. Woody, earthy, tannic and funky with some cheese, this is beautifully balanced. Light lemon peel with some grapefruit. A little mushroom too. As it warms up, the grapefruit bitterness grows. No trace of acetic acid is present. Warmth and swirling bring out barnyard and hay aromas too. Just fantastic.  The palate opens tannic with a mild lemon peel astringency immediately noticeable. Plenty of lemon character, this beer makes me think of biting into the white part of the lemon peel with it's characteristic bitterness. It evolves to a grapefruit bitterness with time. Very very well-balanced. The case can be made for calling this beer out on the basis of the faint oxidation that manifests itself by way of slightly stale malt, that if darker, would be more leather-like. Let my score speak for on which side of the defense I rest my case. The funk isn't as prominent as on the nose, growing as it warms and with addition of the yeast, both of which bring out the wet wood, wet dog and barnyard and hay characteristics in various amounts. Woody and mushroom characters grow with temperature, making this more reminiscent of the J&J Blauw. Grapefruit peel bitterness on the finish, the palate is beautifully balanced. Medium-light in body, this is mildly cheesy and has high carbonation. Fantastic stuff, I could drink this all day.  I alluded to the Blauw in my review, and it's probably no coincidence. The Blauw, which was blended a year after this, incorporated a 4 year old Girardin lambic. This includes a 3 year old Girardin lambic, some of which was probably leftover and aged until blended into the J&J. I have a fantasy of assembling all the rare Drie Fonteinen beers (97,50th, 99, Millenium, 2002 Vintage, and both J&Js) and organize a tasting with Armand leading, talking about his inspiration and aspiration for each blend. Sadly, that will not come to be, but I'm working quite well down that list of rare beers there. Thanks again, Brian!  **Edit 27 July 2012**  I get to revisit the 2007 vintage. The nose is fruity (apricots) floral (rose and jasmine) with oak (vanilla and tannins). An aroma reminiscent of Hallertau hops is present. The palate opens sour, lactic , oaky and very tannic with mild lemon. Very oaky with low vanilla flavor. Drying, hoppy finish, solid stuff. Needs time, maybe? S/T/M= 4/4/4  **Edit 30 Aug 2012**  I split a bottle of the 2005 vintage with Nathan. IMO, at this time, it the best beer of the bunch. Bright but mellow with fleshy, ripe and sour grapefruit, with a deep, complex funk, moderately earthy and horesey. Ripe and rotten lemons are also present. Exceptional. S/T/M = 5/5/5 **Edit 24 July 2015** Almost side by side with the regular 2005 Oude Gueuze, this beer shows its magnificence. Bright, sharp, lemon rind, grapefruit, melons, mushroomy funk, earth, hay, barnyard, endlessly funky, deep, woodsy. Brilliant on the palate, clean, funky citrus, light, airy on the palate, lactic, lemon sorbet. Stunning. 5/5/5",0.7078813182331796,5.0,0.9926
Oude Geuze Vintage,"750ml, bottled on 27/12/07, into an Unibroue tulip.  A: CLear, bright orange body under an inch of fine, frothy tan foam. Light, spotty lace. Lovely.  S: Very, very fresh, bright, adventurous aroma of citric acidity along with big floral notes. Underneath lies plenty of equally bright funk - barnyard, sharp cheese, and plenty of grass. Fantastic.  T: Sourness dominates, with zesty fruitiness, sweet-tart candy, and some cheesy, grassy, and earthy funk. The tartness is consistent throughout, and always refreshing. Amazing.  M: Smooth medium body with moderate, lively carbonation. Perfect.  O: I continue to be blown away by Armand's Geuzes. I hope I'm rich someday so I can have a cellar full of them - of course, I got this bottle at the brewery for something like 7 euro, so for once a world-class Lambic didn't cost an arm and a leg. I would drink this daily if I could (unless I had an equally unlimited supply of Armand'4 Lente, that is). I can't wait to try more vintages of this fantastic beer.

Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Serving Type: Bottle (2013) Consumed: 12.19.15  A: 4.5 Pours nearly black with a bit of reddish-brown around the edges. Small, light tan head that dissipates rather quickly, but leaves a bit of lace in the glass.  S: 4.5 Lots of dark and milk chocolate on the nose with a pretty strong oak presence, bringing bourbon, vanilla, and caramel. Roasted malt aromas and molasses are pretty mild by comparison, but it’s still there. Some raisin and toffee come through as the beer warms.  T: 4.5 Flavors start off sweet with marshmallow, vanilla, caramel, and strong bourbon. Roasted malt and coffee build and seamlessly start to take over the experience from the sweeter flavors. Blackberries, molasses, and a tiny bit of oxidation work in before a light lingering bitterness and coffee finish things off.  M: 4.5 Good body and really nice carb. Not the thickest imperial stout, but not too thin either.  O: 4.5 Definitely an exceptional BA stout. Lots of really great flavors, but also nothing too unique, which is kind of this beer’s downfall. For the price, you would hope it would be substantially different from BA stouts that are half the price, but it’s not. Definitely worth trying, but not something to stock up on.",0.6710761899101885,4.5,0.9926
Second Fiddle,"Poured into a snifter/tulip/wine hybrid glass  A - Really nice copper/blood red orange, half finger slightly off-white head and very sticky.  S - the sweet baking yeast is up front, sweet flowers, sweet hops, sweet pine, slight dry earth, no hint of booze. slight orange juice and rind, a bit of fresh cut grass and awesomeness.  T - Very bright orange/citrus, citrus rind, really nice bitter, a bit of terrior, baking yeast, very dry malt/grain and near perfect on the bitter/sweet ratio.   M - Full bodied, well balanced, nice complexity, medium plus acidity, medium to medium plus carbonation. A steller DIPA for sure. Aspects of East and West Coast meet.   D/O - My kind of DIPA for sure. Has the ease of drink, the flavor profile and the alcohol content. I really like the east meets west with some old world thrown in that this IPA has. Out of the can or in a glass, doesn't matter, awesome. Goes amazing with homemade grilled chicken and man and cheese.   Final thoughts - It was a gift, no idea on the price. Love the plus 8% ABV and really stoked on people continuing the legacy of great DIPAs and IPAs.",0.6734079354511613,4.5,0.9926
Enjoy By IPA,It’s was a Christmas miracle for me today when I found this at my Piggly Wiggly. I’ve know about this beer for years but I could never find it in my area. What a Great Beer! Pours a crystal clear amber with great lacing. Smells of fresh pine and citrusy bliss. So smooth at first with a big hoppy bite you want in an IPA. Mouthfeel is outstanding with very light carbonation. 9.4%ABV is sneaky because this beer is so smooth and refreshing. Merry Christmas to all and to all a Great DIPA.,0.6504654032402825,4.75,0.9925
Green,"Canned on 6/21/18  Pours a totally hazy light gold with a nice off-white head; the lacing displays like a modern art gala, and really never disappears.  The aroma is striking but clean, with notes of prickly aloe and other herbs at the forefront. These are quickly followed by a nuanced barrage of overripe mango, fresh oranges, and dank, fresh-cut grass to soften it all out.  Bits of prickly earth continue on through the taste, as I'm getting very light black pepper and a nice variety of herbal hop notes. A juicyness bursts cleverly through the earthy notes, finishing on a high of mango and orange that is inherently refreshing while never abandoning the herbal undertones.  Mouthfeel is brilliantly carbonated and maintains a level of 'fluff to it that's near perfect, but also possesses a touch of dryness that really brings it to a new level; the flavor stays intact, leaving the finish crisp and refined.  Such a well-made brew, and a great first impression of Tree House. Felt the need to sit back and really gather my thoughts for this one, as I wanted to avoid reflecting with fresh hype; ultimately, it's difficult to ignore the pillowy mouthfeel, defined, well-executed flavors, and supreme drinkability of Green. This is good beer, and it leaves me excited to see more of what TH has to offer.",0.7290925953605876,4.5,0.9925
Juicy,"Two 375ml bottles opened at once and split three ways, purchased at the brewery 2-3 weeks ago. Poured into HF stemmed glass. Slight gusher when opened, nothing too bad though.  A- Pours a slightly organish brownish red that is slightly translucent with a bit of haze. About a finger's worth of head that fades pretty fast to a fairly bubbly, but mostly flat surface that leaves some clingy lacing. On close inspection of one of the bottles there is some definite small white sedimentation specs floating around (similar to what you would find from a poured Heady Topper). Overall an interesting appearance, a little bit darker then expected but has a nice glow.  S- Funky, citrusy, tart, earthy aromas of citrus hops, sour lemons, grapefruit, chardonnay, limes, bretty funk, and a light presence of what some people might refer to as wet-horse blanket or sweaty gym clothes. As it settles for awhile the funk fades a little bit and more earthy tones come out. Fairly aromatic and reminds me a little bit of a hoppy/citrusy Beatification that is slightly less funky.  T- Hops balance nicely with the sour/funk aspects of the beer to provide tastes of sour lemons, grapefruit, some melons, a hint of lime, some light bretty funkiness, sour finish with a slight presence of citric acid. Lingering aftertastes of sour lemons and a bit of brett. A little less funky but a bit more sour then the nose. As it settles for awhile sourness dies a little bit and a little bit more earthy brett comes out.  M- Medium bodied, juicy with a dry finish, fairly minimal carbonation but leaves a tingly sensation that makes it feel more carbonated then it actually is, fairly high drinkability.  O- This was a very interesting, complex saison. It was definitely funkier then I was expecting but it balanced nicely with the citrus hops presence which lended a little bit of a Juicy quality as you would expect from the name. There was definitely a hint of Mimosa in this that provided a little bit lemon. I would definitely recommend trying this beer out especially if you like beers with a little bit more funk to them. It'll be interesting to see how this one ages.",0.6890127736999361,4.5,0.9925
Coconut B-Bomb,"this is insanely good, of course we all know and love the base beer, and each of the variants have had have been exceptional too. i never thought this beer needed coconut, or even asked for it. i always picked up a bit from the barrel and the mash and everything, there were suggestions of it everywhere, but now that its actually an ingredient, its so forward in here its crazy, they must have used an awful lot of coconuts. it comes through the thick leggy near black beer really well in the nose, sort of toasted and fresh at the same time, desserty but more earthy than sweet, and loving the bourbon character thats all over this, the oak, and the chocolate aspect of the malt! i get licorice, barrel char, vanilla, and maple in the flavor along with the whiskey, the chocolate, and the booze. the coconut is as robust as it smells, sort of shredded and baked brown, sweet and almost gooey in here, this is rich and decadent beer of the highest order. tons of body, syrupy textured even in the absence of much carbonation, it lets this linger and sink in beautifully. coconut essence abounds in the finish, bakers chocolate, cigar, and toasted marshmallow. splendid, ahead of my expectations, i thought it would be overdone and its perfect!",0.6622522158753885,4.5,0.9925
Chocolate Rain,"2013 vintage 750ML - NYC bottle share with mdfb79. Thanks Dan – Whalez Bro! 12/12/13 – Served in a Duvel tulip glass  A: Viscous looking body collects a dark black pearl in the glass with a light edging of more translucent brown. Thin wisp of quick going khaki cream settles out to a partial ring. Minor alcohol runners and a couple dots of stick are left behind.   S: Cocoa nib and booze at the forefront. Loads of dark roast character with more fudgy chocolate, molasses, and dark fruits. The barrel aging is there with a touch of woodsy earth, crème brulee, and vanilla bourbon spice. Light undertones of toasted coconut and coffee. I get a touch of soy sauce/umami thing going on in the background as well. Overall nice with good chocolate aromas but a touch boozy and rather restrained bourbon notes.   T: Chocolate mousse cake with toasted caramels, cherry cordial, and plum. Not the most chocolaty beer I have had but with good complementing layers of dark roasted grain, vanilla bean, molasses, and toasted coconut. Boozy alcohol but it is tolerable here. The beers dessert like sweetness is cut by the intense alcohol sting and a higher amount of hop bitterness. Earthy with some mild spice. The vanilla, charred oak, and bourbon really start to perk as the beer warms up which takes some effort. A great beer but not quite up to my expectations. Hits you like a chocolate liqueur majority of the time.  M: Heavy and slick from the seemingly lower amount of carbonation. Has a fairly viscous quality that is relatively balanced by a nice bitter bite and light drying finish. Warming alcohol coats the palate.   D: A nice sipper and definitely a great feat in craft beer but didn’t quite meet expectations. It is chocolate and booze with some timid barrel character. I feel there are just other beers with more developed chocolate and better bourbon character. Would really like to spend some more time with this one though.",0.6602581091161903,4.25,0.9925
Nelson,"Green Flash bottle. BB April 2016.  A - Bright. Golden or light golden. Two finger white head. Some particulate in the body. Minimal carbonation. Rings of lace and a film of retention.   S - Spice, fruit, rye note is there in a spicy malt note, lot's of nice zippy hop. Huge Nelson Sauvin note.  T - The rye and fruity note balance so nicely. Nelson character comes in so well and shines. Big hop and malt blows.  M - Nice carbonation, medium body and a spicy, fruity finish with a good but not overpowering bitterness.  O/D - Lovely stuff. So subtle but so complex as well. The spice and fruit work so well together. Excellent and drinkable for the ABV. I wasn't expecting a ton from this, but this was very impressive. Awesome.",0.7011853438105878,4.75,0.9924
Aaron,"This one pours a nice looking brown/ruby with a thin head that breaks into a cap and collar. The cap doesn't last long, and the collar leaves some minor lacing in its wake.  The smell is divine. Sweetness leads the way, with brown sugar and dark fruits. Then you get a touch of barrel notes, and it finishes off with mild hops.  Taste is like the nose, being led by the sweetness. in spite of a strong sweetness, there is a nice balance with the barrel notes, which is quite subtle, and then the hops finish. This is a real enjoyable sipper.  Feel is full with lower carbonation. There is a sticky coating finish to this one, and the sweetness lasts. While I can only assume a high ABV this is a well hidden aspect.  Wow, what a great beer. I mean this is top ten for me. Such a beautiful sipper, I was very sad when it was all gone. The flavors are so nice, and they meld so nicely. If you are a fan of English Barleywines run, don't walk, to try to get a bottle.",0.6711666152619193,4.75,0.9924
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Description: No head or lacing to speak of and only a small amount of legs. Dark black appearance, almost inky. The smell was more wood/oak and bourbon than coffee, which I really only picked up a hint of. No that that's bad, but just wan't what I expected. Also some dark fruit (prune?) in there. The coffee was much more apparent in the taste, both up front and on the back of the palate. However, the coffee didn't overwhelm the beer as with some coffee stouts, which I appreciated. Bourbon and oak were also noticeable as might be expected. Feel was more creamy than syrupy and maybe a little thin but still very good.  Suggested food pairing: Dark chocolate  If you like this beer then you should also try: Bourbon Barrel Black Maple  Overall: 4.5 (This beer is very good and I would definitely drink it again) Best coffee stout I've ever had. Really nice that the coffee was certainly noticeable and the star of the show without drowning out everything else. Along with BBBM and Oro Negro, JO's has built a pretty impressive lineup of stouts/porters. I'm already looking forward to what they'll come up with next!",0.63484494904425,4.5,0.9924
Juicy,"Happy Thanksgiving! 375ml bottle 8 days after release poured into HF stemware. Gushes out so be ready with your glass upon opening.  A: Burnt sunset orange - it looks Juicy! More than an finger of off white foam dissipating to half a finger or so that remains. Nice chunks of lacing even early on. Cloudy, opaqueness with bits of yeast and other barrel buddies settling to bottom. Tiny bubbles frolic.  S: Funky and bright. Citrus/lemon zest aromas of the NZ (riwaka?) hops. Musty but invogorating as opposed to dank. Orange! Perhaps it's Mimosa lineage coming through? Either way it's fantastic.  T: Tart, but not sour per se. Strong citrus flavors. Slight peachiness? A blast of yeast and brett appear mid palate and meld well with the creeping bitterness. A lot going on here, but somehow Shaun and Co. have managed to optimize and it comes off flawlessly. Delicious.  M: Refreshingly, zesty, light at first. Slight creaminess weaving with some dryness as the finish approaches. Upon swallowing your mouth and mind want another sip! Never becomes heavy, cloying or overbearing.  O: Saison? American Wild Ale? I'd say some where in between and encompassing the best of both worlds. What can I say that hasn't been said of HF. I'm so happy I live in New England. I haven't had Ann, but I probably prefer this over Mimosa. If you get the chance to drink Juicy do it--early and often!",0.6568002204069361,5.0,0.9924
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Beautiful dark pink pour with great clarity and a big frothy lighter shade of pink head to it. A work of art. Massive sour aroma, possibly the most I've ever come across. Damn. Delivers on the cherry aroma as well, could be bigger, comes with some oak to round it out, just another amazing sense experience. Stays away from what is often undesireable funk aroma and just goes heavy on the sour.  Heavily sour, acidic, big time cherry delivery, yet a light body, not syrupy or anywhere near being overly sweet. If you're all about sour and cherries, this is your beer. Discernably better than the cherry stuff from Cantillon, who makes nothing but excellent stuff. Its not just cherry though, the acidic and light body makes me think some lemon and lime have a role up in here. These shaerbeekse cherries really seem way more tart than any other kind.   Great dry mouthfeel, sourness never fades, good at any temperature. Amazing stuff at a high price tag, but definitely worthy on special occasions.  EDIT: The last bottle I had could have used a tad more carbonation, still lovely, but had to change the 4.85 score it was. We'll see if it rises back to the top, still have plenty of bottles on hand.",0.6782650276225868,4.5,0.9924
Nelson,"Bottle. Finally. Perhaps my longest standing want. I've heard its not as good as it was before Green Flash but I don't know if I ever would have had the chance to try it without them. It pours clearer than I was expecting. Probably more filtered. Well structured, white head. Lacing is thick. The aroma brings my favorite hop right to my receptors. Tropical fruit, earth and flora. Some Sauv Blanc notes. Some dankness. A bit of sweetness too. Smells very nice. Love Nelson hops! The flavor starts off with a pronounced, coercive citrus flavor. A combination of several high-acid citrus fruits. Then the more terroir-driven hop flavors come out. Really vibrant hoppiness. Pot and earth and herb as well. Really damn tasty. Rye malt acts as a unique prop for the Nelson deliciousness. Rye tang combines with the unique hop zest. Its medium bodied and quite bitter. Still very drinkable. A morning juice substitute in a perfect world. Whether its different than it used to be or not, this is still an excellent beer. Finally got to scratch this one off the list; grateful.",0.6909037557794823,4.25,0.9924
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"This is probably my favorite trillium offering so far and one that truly stands unique amongst the rest. When you first crack the can, all you can smell is orange. You don't even need to be close to it to notice the strong aroma. Pours a light very hazy yellow orange that falls more towards the yellow side than the red spectrum. About an inch of off white head that dissipates over the course of a few minutes leaving a ring around the edge of the glass with lacing throughout. The smell of this beer is an orange bomb! I love orange so I love the smell. You also get a bit of lime on the very front of your nose, especially as the beer warms up. Taste follows the smell with a pleasant not overly bitter back end. Some of the street beers can be a bit too bitter for my tastes but this one has just the right amount for me. It is sweet up front from the citrus nose but the middle is dry and it leaves a lingering citrus candy aftertaste from the hop resins. The feel of this beer is medium thick with a moderately lively carbonation; has a nice body. Overall this beer is great! Awesome nose that is not ruined by an overtly bitter finish. Citrusy and smooth.",0.6669058475657876,4.75,0.9923
Black Tuesday,"2015 version   Poured into a snifter. It is a little less viscous looking than a lot of the other Bruery beers. It is an glossy jet black with a dark brown head that settles quickly into the beer.   It smells phenomenal. Lots of rich aromas of coconut, vanilla, marshmallow, bourbon, charred oak, chocolate, barley, and raisins/dates. Alcohol is noticeable, but nothing unexpected at 20%.   All of that gets pretty much squashed by a ton of alcohol in the flavor. It is borderline undrinkable cold. As it warms, you can start to get some charred oak, Rice Krispy treat like marshmallow sweetness, coconut, licorice, and rich milk chocolate, but it is still overshadowed by a boozy burn. It is very rich overall, and reminds me of a Bourbon County beer with the distinct aroma and flavor. Not as heavy of a body though. Between my brother and I, we struggled to drink half a bottle. For what it's worth, I don't think World Wide Stout is nearly as hot and I drink bourbon neat, so I feel like I am a pretty objective opinion.",0.6497689327021743,3.75,0.9923
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"a: silky black color that lets a little light through, which gives the top of the glass a muddy brown color. very shiny. no head - there is a dark tan film on top  s: aroma on this is incredible. roasted malts, dark chocolate, rich oak, leather, vanilla, molasses, leather, bourbon, dark cherry, an almost coffee-like presence, and finishes the nose with more dark chocolate  t: slightly bitter dark chocolate, chewy coffee, roasted malts, oak, vanilla, a dash of honey sweetness, cola. i'm glad to see that dark cherry also made its way into the taste as well. there is a silky molasses sweetness as well (a touch darker tasting than honey). there is a real nice dark, earthy flavor coming from the wood in here as well. the bourbon is laying in the background here - just a faint hint, adding a real nice layer of complexity and depth to this. a real treat  m: medium mouthfeel - a tad lighter than i was expecting, but it really works well with the way the beer has been made  o: this is a delightful beer to drink. the flavor has great depth, and is extremely well harmonized. price tag is high, for sure, but this is a fantastic sipper, and a great one to share",0.6738851508809587,4.5,0.9923
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2008 vintage poured into a snifter.   A: Pours a mostly opaque maroon with a frothy head that is so pink it looks like a party trick. If there was ever a beer that should mascot this style it's this one.   S: This one definitely had some putrid notes when I had it a little too cold, but as it warmed up to normal temperatures it started smelling quite nice. Very tart raspberries and even some cherry notes with some oak and barnyard funk. Tartness definitely stands out.   T: Sure enough the bite on this is quite tart and can hit some parts of the mouth with an acidic sting. Sweeter raspberries pop out with an almost musty air in the middle taste that dies out with a linger of lemon zest and grassy notes. More tart than I expected and probably more than I really enjoy, but I can't say the beer isn't unusually good.   M: Like every cantillon I've had it's carbonated to a level that makes the flavors seem like they're celebrating and comes into the mouth like a dam broke on your lips. Refreshing, crisp, true to the style.   O: Though my fears allayed as the beer warmed up, I did pick up this bottle at a beer shop in london that didn't seem to know anything about cantillon, much less beer in genral, and I can't account for the care that they or anyone else handled this and whether or not the bottle may have been compromised in some way. I will say simply that tart raspberry with a handful of other punching notes is about all I experienced with this beer and it wasn't as complex, sweet, or flavorful as I expected. If it's what the beer is intended to be, then great, it was good. If not and my bottle was compromised, then the beer must be damned amazing because that's the best compromise I've had.",0.6506395065135143,4.0,0.9923
Chocolate Rain,"2016 Chocolate Rain. I've had it on tap and bottle and it's fantastic and consistent. This beer pours dark brown, and not pitch black like many stout chasers enjoy. I love aesthetics, but with stouts just need to be dark. Darker better? meh.  The nose is quite inviting. The vanilla and bourbon just screams dessert. Hints of roasty malt and oats, and some earthiness.   Take a sip. Bourbon whiskey, dark chocolate and subtle vanilla flood the palate. Definite barrel, but just perfectly balanced and smooth for the heat level. Not a nilla bomb, not a chocolate beer... its just so dang balanced.   Thin feel, but great coat and nothing lacking in experience. Smooth warmth from the ABV makes it's presence known but blends in quickly.  Overall, this might be my favorite weekday stout from the Bruery. I prefer some sweetness to my stouts, and if do too, fine one!",0.6978307008259417,4.75,0.9923
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"UPDATE: Just sampled the 2009 edition and it was exponetially better. Much fresher berry presence and it just felt like the bottle was treated better over it's lifespan. Increasing my rating to effect.  Bottle courtesy of alpineclimber. 2008 version.  Pours a slightly hazy dark pink color with a huge beautiful light pink-hued bubbly head that eventually recedes leaving some minimal lacing.  Aromas initially made me say Holy F#$% out loud! Sweet, ripe raspberries coupled with that musty Brett that all the best Cantillons have. Some more lemon, oak and some acidic notes emerge as it warms. Really funky and fruity.  The tastes follow the nose but are sadly a little less enjoyable. I expected a big burst of sourness or Brett funk or fruity berries, and they are all there don't get me wrong, but they are muted compared to my expectations from the aroma. Definitely more oak and vinous flavors than I perceived in the aromas as well. Acidic lemon/white grape skin emerge as it warms a little more.  The mouthfeel is quite light bodied but expected for the ABV. Carbonation is also in the medium range. The finish is dry but not overly so and sour/tart but not overly so there either. To be honest it felt a little watery on my palate which I have never experienced with any of Cantillon's offerings.  Overall this was good, but not great for me at the level of Saint Lamvinous or Fou Foune to be honest. While it is definitely still top class, I don't have the urge/need to seek this out again in the future. Maybe the reputation, expectations and/or the awesome aroma got me too hyped up here",0.6975312151726314,4.5,0.9922
Beatification,"Thank you Stevedore for this awesome bottle share. Poured into a Bells snifter.  Beer pours hazy straw yellow with a fluffy white head that sticks around for a bit. It's just chillin'. Beat is a pretty inconspicuous beer for being such a beast.  Smells sour. It just kind of made me laugh once I took a whiff. Smells a lot like SitR although there is clearly more lactic in this guy. Lemons and vinegar. Green apple? A little bit. I do get that barrel complexity somewhere in the nose. It doesn't come across as clean oak; instead the barrel has a funky damp wood smell--awesome in sours, shitty in stouts.   Flavor is very complex, but that complexity is hidden by the sourness. Yeah. Beat is very sour. What surprised me is how good everything else about this beer is. Dat balance. I don't quite understand how the sourest beer I've ever had was so damn drinkable. Flavors of lemon and vinegar. The signature lactic flavor is huge. I can definitely taste dank oak. there is brett contributing to some funkiness. There is also some spiciness. After each sip your mouth responds with some sweetness. There is a lot going on here, but I can't necessarily detect what. Each sip makes you think, ""wtf."" Beat is a very tasty and enjoyable beer.   As I mentioned, the balance is top-notch. This is a bit of an anomaly for being so damn sour. Carbonation is medium-high. The whole beer is right where you want it to be. Masterfully crafted stuff.  So yeah... Overall this is pretty phenomenal. One of the few beers that has made my perpetual want list. I might like Consecration a bit more overall, but I would rather be drinking this. It's funny to say, but this is the most entertaining sour I've ever tried. Let's hope I can get more soon.",0.6436498556674187,4.75,0.9922
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Poured from a 500ml bottle into a Teku/IPA shaped pint glass after swirling yeast to mix in after half the bottle was poured out.  Look: Wonderful hazy gold/toasted yellow pour. 1/2 cm rocky foam that slowly dissipates into a 1 mm lacy foam head. Smell: Strong, light fruit smell off the bat. Nice hint of fresh baked bread from the malt. Tiniest hints of cloves and vanilla. Taste: Sweetness coats the tongue. Starts out nice and malty, with a hint of roasted nuts. Very quick flash of cloves act as a transition. Majority of the flavor is a very soft fruit flavor that makes its presence known quickly, and slowly fades into the background where the cloves make another brief but noticeable appearance.  Feel: Very smooth, slightly thick but not chewy. Flows very smoothly over the tongue, carbonation is very well balanced.  Overall: A fantastic beer, that everyone should try. I would highly recommend keeping this stocked, or using as a special treat for oneself. The best way I can describe this beer is that it tastes like biting into a piece of freshly baked banana bread that has just a tiny bit of walnuts in it. One of my favorite beers, without a doubt.",0.6801203986331491,4.75,0.9922
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Had this on tap at DLD 2011 in the Brewpub. I absolutely love Three Floyds. Bourbon Barrel dark Lord is the description.  A: Definitely pours black as hell with a small tan ring of head and great legs of alcohol. Very nice look.  S: Wow, the best mix of amazing sweet and savory bourbon with huge dark malt of any bourbon aged stout I've had to date. Raisin, Vanilla, burnt malt, dark fruit all combine amazingly. Complex and exceptional.  T: Taste does not disappoint, Might be the best tasting beer I've ever had even better than Vanilla IMHO. More flavors from the already bourbon and dark malt smell characters include molasses, vanilla bean, dark fruit, some coffee roast, and more. Tastes like the stout I think God would want to have.  M: Smooth and mostly not too hot, but a little alcohol lingers here. Would easily be a 5 with some age.  D: Totally amazing and just a pleasure to try. I beginning to think Dark Lord might be the best stout the barrel age in history.",0.6481215446184994,5.0,0.9922
Mastermind,"This beer is a muddles dark yellow/pale orange color, extremely thick as some swirling sediment settles, and initially this actually develops a sort of sediment cloud that dissipates to form the complete opacity that it finishes with. The head is an impressively strong and sizeable pure white one, a crown that never drops below half a finger and leaves chunky lacing in good volume. I'm impressed by the aromatics even with all the hype, and I don't even need to get my nose very close to the glass to get a burst of tangerine and grapefruit. Just a few moments give the bouquet time to develops to an extremely strong dose of pine and, in a good way, a bit of earth/soil. There are levels of depth to work through, though, and a little more rawness, leaf, even some herb from the middle to finish, all come out to mingle together and make for one of the best aroma I've gotten from any hoppy beer. It's strong, for sure, with hops banging the palate right away but somehow never fatiguing it. There has to be a pretty big malt underneath to balance this hugely hoppy beer this well, adding just enough caramel and honey sweetness to balance almost perfectly without taking anything from the hops. All kinds of bitterness rolls on the tongue from pine to grapefruit peel to pith, maybe a flash of something briny in the middle, but no astringency or harshness. It rides into a floral, even perfumey end with lots more zest lingering into the finish. This is a world-class beer that could be as close to perfect as possible with just the slightest cleanup in the middle as a slight saltiness flashes in, but this is in the upper echelon of DIPAs. The body is as thick as it looks, flowing smoothness beginning each sip and giving way to a strong bite of crispness that carries through.

Chocolate Rain,"I first had Chocolate Rain on tap at Barcade Philadelphia's 3rd Anniversary party in October 2014. I was floored and stunned and rated it a 4.75. That was a Chocolate Rain 2013 on tap.   1.5 years later, I'm having a bottle of 2013 Chocolate Rain and I am loving the heck out of it. Upon cracking it, it looks menacing and awesome. It smells so complex and intense, I thought I would pass out. Smoke, cigar ash, country ham from the boonies of Appalachia, bacon, chocolate, vanilla, alcohol, burnt sugar and dirty porn. Truly heavenly, and then some. Nice carbonated mocha-colored head that vanishes in about as long as it takes to say ""The Bruery Chocolate Rain 2013 Vintage""  The taste follows the nose, with a big hit of sweetness that never gets out of control. This is similar to Bourbon County, but way better at the same time; the big sweet boozy beer for those not afraid of big boozy sweet beers. Chocolate all around, nice smoky finish.   Mouthfeel is perfect for the style, big and thick and creamy and bold. Heavy and outrageous.   Overall, this is my one of my favorite beers ever and I am so tempted to flat-out rate it a perfect ""5"" overall. I paid $65 for this bottle and I would do it again. And again. And again... Oh You Chocolate Rain!!!!",0.5970875015552456,4.75,0.9921
Double Orange Starfish,"Purchased at Aslin Beer Company, Herndon, VA, second or third batch I've tried. Served in a Pilsner Urquell glass brought back from Berlin in 1987!  Hazy, cloudy, nearly opaque view poured hard and yielded a small bubble froth that stays as you drink. Full lacing sticks on the glass. This is a fruit bomb but all very balanced and a legendary double version of their killer OS. I absolutely LOVE what Aslin is doing with so many of their beers, experimenting and pushing the envelope. This is closer to what I'd refer to as a ""clean"" NE Hazy IPA but with great flavors.  Big hops prevalent but not all mixed up, straight at you. This is both Orange Juice and a mix of tropical fruit, all blended perfectly with no sense that you are getting hammered with this 8.3% DIPA! You'll never confuse this with a Lawson's but I really love what Aslin is doing with all the flavor mixes and they obviously obsessed with making great beer.  I'm a huge fan of this beer, the regular Orange Starfish and so many more from Aslin. So lucky to be somewhat ""local"" and often make the 3-4 hour round trip just to pick up new releases. Spent nearly a grand there in the last month!",0.6321471958910263,4.75,0.9921
Sang Noir,"2014 project. I think I got this as a gift from my brother in law. This is the first higher-strength beer I've ever had from Cascade, whose brews are always good but never quite so good as to warrant their price.  Cork comes out very easily and the beer pours with precious little carbonation. Pours very dark and still, resembling a flat oud bruin.   Smells tart and bourbony, with bacterial sour cherry nodes smoothed out by oaky vanilla. Not picking up anything vinous, but overall it's a nice aroma with great balance and decent complexity.  The flavor is more complex, and rather more tart. Bracingly acidic yeast starts things out, which is still a bit of a kick in the teeth even after 2+ years of aging. The middle is fruitier, with strong notes of sour fruit and lively red wine. The vanilla oakiness of the aroma is only present here at the very end of the sip and in the aftertaste, with the finish serving as a firm, if indirect, balance to the bracing start.  Overall, a beer of high character and complexity. One of the better truly puckerking sours I've come across in quite some time.",0.7160162031897064,4.5,0.9921
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Body is black varnish, topped with half finger of tan, creamy head that quickly dissipates to leave a wine-like surface.  On the nose I get maple roasted nuts, chocolate syrup, and some vanilla as it warms. It's not terribly complex here, as there is some bourbon that is itching to take hold. I'm having this very fresh on draft and wondering if time will alter this. Older reviews on previous iterations of this beer are citing a bigger coffee presence, but normally coffee fades with time--maybe the barrel treatment produces the opposite effect.  Taste has a strong boozy heat to it, but it's not quite at the level so as to be overwhelming. The bourbon is cut by a sharp coffee element, but that woodiness just keeps coming on in waves, and the coffee is not as assertive as I'd like. However, flavor improves greatly as it warms--do not serve this too cold, which even the brewery is doing right now. Let this sucker warm up before even thinking about pouring it, let alone drinking it. Nuttier, bitter coffee emerges as it reaches temp, with a touch of roastiness and something sharp like sassafras root.   Up front, the feel is extra dry, with lots of barrel oak. Body is thin yet oddly crisp and fizzy, but with the unusually dry intro, this is pretty drinkable. I can see how this is a big hit with a certain crowd, but beware of my review, I'm pretty fickle when it comes to BB beers.  Update: I've let this sit in the bottle a month and a half, and it does seem to be improving as someone else on here recommended.  Smell is better, with an essence of vanilla cream dollop stirred into some nice smooth coffee and a little melted chocolate. A little nutty barrel emerges as it warms, similar to BB Oil.  It's tasting less harsh and boozy, with some nice, softening, slightly sweetened chocolate milk mixed in to the rest of the elements I originally got when ""fresh.""  Still, it's surprisingly thin, like really thin, verging on watery.  For those that prefer liquor to beer, it makes sense for this one to have such high regard, but I like beer with a substantial mouthfeel, especially the big ones.",0.6702845132428362,3.5,0.9921
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Big thanks goes out to funkydelic for sharing this one during a recent tasting! Another brew that has long evaded me to try at a tasting! 2007 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Boulevard tulip. Poured yellow-orange with a one finger subtle off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, lemon rine, funk, sour, tart, fruit, and citrus. The flavor was of sweet malt, lemon rine, funk, sour, tart, and citrus. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. A beer that I have been wanting to try for quite some time that has been at MANY tastings, but never gotten opened. It finally happened! I am a huge fan of the regular version, but this one takes it to a new level with a more citrus and lemon rine aspect going on than the regular. It was quite drinkable and extremely enjoyable. While being very sour and tart it didn’t make me feel like my teeth were melting which was a nice welcomed change. Definitely worth seeking out and I would love to see how this one ages over the years in a proper cellar.",0.6757512953483354,4.0,0.9921
Haze,"Picked this up at the brewery on Wednesday when it was breweries. Poured into a tree house teku.   Pours a hazy orange semi-cloudy brew. Not as thick looking as some of their other beers. Thick lacing that hangs on the glass.   Smells like citrus and hops. Peach, passion fruit, All the things they are known for but with a little more bite from the double.   Taste is amazing. It follows the nose with fruit, citrus and a nice touch of hops.   Mouth feel is smooth. Love the way it hangs on the tongue.   Overall, another great offering. Love tree house. It's not hype and NE style juice IPAs are awesome. Glad I went there and stood in the line to get it.",0.6085314900343812,4.75,0.9921
Chocolate Rain,"Chocolate Rain 750ml, 19.5%, B2. Ahh we finally meet, bottle opened and split between a few other BA's, 6/1/13 ESN2!  Appearance - Poured a deep almost black with dark red edges with very little head but left a thin ring in the center and around the edge of the glass.  Smell - Wow are you kidding me!! The smell of Chocolate Rain is the best smelling beer i have ever had the chance to smell period!!, sweet baker's chocolate, cocoa, vanilla and bourbon barrel notes all mixed together in an all out attack on the nose, i could of sat and smelled it all night.  Taste - Taste mirrors the smell!, big sweet chocolate (go figure), bourbon, vanilla, oak from the barrel that all blends together perfectly. 19.5% not here! There is a little alcohol heat in the back end but it never got overpowering even as it warmed up and the after taste hangs around for days!   Mouth feel - Velvety, creamy and silky all at the same time great mouth feel.  Overall - This is an absolute must try and is totally worth it, how ever you can get your hands on a bottle do it!! This beer may have ruined this style of big high ABV barrel aged beers for me as nothing will live up to what this one did. IMO this is perfection in a bottle hype well deserved.",0.6169298409759684,5.0,0.9921
Sip Of Sunshine,"Pours a mostly clear albeit cloudy orange color. Bright and bronzed. Thin velvety white foamy head dissipates somewhat but never completely.   Bright aromas of orange, grapefruit, pine, and a strong malty backbone on the aroma.   Taste follows the nose with immediate notes of orange, orange rind, pine, sap, and grapefruit giving way to a strong malty backbone with caramel notes. Strong piney bitterness starts on the back end and lingers into the finish.   Feel is medium bodied, but not too heavy. Somewhat oily, smooth and slick. Moderate yet bright carbonation. This feel is really perfect for a DIPA.   Overall, a lovely DIPA that does live up to its reputation as an outstanding example of the style.",0.7212026524427377,4.25,0.9921
Madagascar,"Deviating from my normal review notes because I was so captivated by @smakawhat's review - this awesome BA captured the essence of everything I thought. Batch 3 is a decadent treat and infinitely complex with its depth of vanilla, bourbon, cocoa, and marshmallow flavors. It feels lame mailing in a review like this, but I read that review and found myself agreeing with every sentence - 4 Hands should pay royalties for tasting notes!   For what it's worth, I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Too many bourbon barrel-aged stouts get overpowered by a jarring alcohol taste and this batch of Madagascar deftly avoids that and presents a refined and nuanced flavor profile that keenly plays on a rich milk stout complemented by robust chocolate and vanilla notes. A phenomenal brew for sure.  TL;DR: This is a glorious bourbon-soaked s'more replete with milk chocolate and sweet marshmallow flavors. Do everything in your power to get a bottle!",0.6920278176948975,4.75,0.992
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Hand bottle provided by gunhaver.  A: Pours as dark as night, flat pitch black with only a bubble or two for a head. The beer is thick, dense, it literally coats the glass.  S: Huge vanilla aromas, from the wood I guess. Nothing artifical about the vanilla though, it is like creamy buttery vanilla. The wood component is huge as well. Like fresh cut oak. Strong roasty notes are there along with hints of molasses and chocolate.  T: Holy Hell! There is nothing like this beer. It is the king of barrel aged beers in my mind without a doubt. Fudge like chocolate up front along with a big blast of roast. The oak component is huge and so enjoyable. Vanilla manages to push through with hints of bourbon. A slight milky coco puffs flavor can be picked up as well. Simple flavors that seem to just meld together perfectly. Really is a perfect beer.  M: Full bodied, lacks carbonation from the hand bottling, but it really don't suffer. I like lower levels of carbonation on RIS' anyway.  D: Wonderful, would love to drink all night until I pass out. Reason enough to make a trip to Dark Lord Day.",0.6577443106203189,5.0,0.992
Swish,"L- Dirty, hazy light orange. Just the way I like 'em.  S- Super tropical and fruity. If possible, it smells well balanced as it doesn't really burn the way some super hoppy, high ABV doubles tend to.  T- Super juicy. Orange and tangerine. A little pine. Hoppy mid palette but it's restrained as it has a nice sweet backbone. The alcohol is extremely well hidden as well.  M- Real nice. Somewhat full, chewy for the style but with the perfect carb and the alcohol is well hidden. Could drink several without issue.  O- Probably my new favorite IIPA. Fresh Heady is hard to beat but this is right there. Just fantastic.",0.7082704657888709,5.0,0.992
Vicinity,"Pint can. Canned on 11/20/17. Opened on 12/6/17  Poyrs out of the can a totally opaque straw gokd with white light and orange hues within. A light drifting, white foam builds up high, dissipates fast to a thin bubbly cover and soft ring around the edge.  The nose is full of intense and fresh smelling hops. Tropical fruits, mellon, pineapple, starfruit, sweet orange. Earthy herbs and funky, wet-earth edge to tge hops makes it bold and very complex. A light, raw honey smell comes from the light, pilsner and wheat style malted barley. Sweetly floral and lemmon zest roybds it out.   I must comment on the mouthfeel and body texture.....soft, crispy, light, but smooth and full....all in one sip...did I mention a dry, earthy bite with the first hit and then again in the finish?! Wow. Boom. A solid, thick and heady body leads to a rather fascinating moythfeel overall. Impressive and classicly New England stylie.   The flavor:.... Certainly dominated by a fresh, earthy, leafy....hop complexity. As with any good New England style DIPA...the layers are multiple and complex. Earthy wheat, funky wet earth, dry wheat fields, tangy and sweet tropical juices with pineapple, black pepper, all spice, lemmon zest, make an appearance at some point. Crisp, pilsner and wheat style malt gives off a virtuous taste that adds color and excellent balance, allowing the hops to take the extended guitar solo, nut damn, if the malt doesn't do a fine job of laying down the rythm and beat.   A solid, hearty liquid fillef with dense hop layers, complex but light toned malt soeaks volumes of the style and the execution within the Vicinity.",0.7446366612674536,4.25,0.992
Todd The Axe Man,"Poured from a 16 oz. can into a tulip.  Pours a hazy amber-gold, with a fine two-finger head that gives way to a lasting foamy skein, and then nice lacing. This brew has a nice ""shimmer"" to it, despite the haze.   The aroma is a jarring mashup of tropical fruit and serious dank. Pineapple, grapefruit, mango, and peach meet pine resin and dank. A very powerful nose, and a good one at that.  The flavors explode in expected and unexpected ways. The malts are fairly present for a single IPA, with tropical fruits hitting the tip of the tongue (mango/pineapple) but serious citrus (grapefruit and lemon zest) and lighter stonefruit (peach and apricot) are there as well. The brew passes over the mid-palate with some good malty/graham cracker sweetness, but swiftly melds into pine hops, white grape must and white pepper, and grassy notes. The flavor finishes with unapologetic pine resin and dank cannabis.   The brew is down the middle, medium-bodied, with excellent carbonation, and a nearly crisp, dry finish. Just a hint of booze on the swallow.   This brew seems to seamlessly straddle the line between juicy IPA and West Coast. The bitter and sweet notes play off of one another perfectly Hazy and sweet in the front, hoppy and weedy in the back. One of my favorite IPA's.",0.6894017637080481,4.5,0.992
Blanc De Blancs,"375ml bottle. Served in a Side Project stemmed glass 3/4/2015.  A- Clear light orange-copper body, one finger white head with fair retention time, not much lacing. Nice thin collar that sticks around the entire time.   S- Lactic acid, clean wheat and pale malt presence, but definitely a lot of oak and lactic acid. The grapes don't come out as much until it warms up, but it's definitely there. White grape must, not much grape juice in terms of the aroma, but that's expected. A little bit of funk, but the lacto is definitely stronger, as is the theme with all of the Side Project wild ales.  F- Wheat, lactic acid, oak, a bit of funk, white grape must. This tastes an awful lot like Fuzzy but without the peaches, and plenty of white grape. This does not deliver a lot of actual white wine character, but rather more of white grape must. That's actually what I seem to prefer, and it's remarkably tasty. That being said, it's also quite tart, similar to how tart Blueberry Flanders was but not quite to the point where it's a turn-off.  M- Medium bodied, silky crispness is very refreshing. The tartness starts burning up your jaws immediately. Very tasty with a lot of nice depth to it. Easy to drink, even with the tartness.  O- Delicious stuff. I enjoyed this one a lot and continue to expect this level of excellence from Side Project, because they keep delivering these hits one after another.",0.7037585572912812,4.5,0.9919
Chocolate Rain,"Thanks Tom for sharing Batch#2 and Merc for sharing Batch#1  The beer pours a deep black with no visible head. The nose is cloyingly sweet with a touch of chocolate and way too much booziness. The taste is just as sweet and the immensely overpowering alcohol makes this beer less than enjoyable. I literally feel my palate burning with each sip...and none of the beers rich, chocolaty body comes to my rescue. I assumed the beer would have a velvety smoothness that masked the alcohol, but this is not the case. (Batch #1 is significantly better with far less high octane ethanol and much more chocolaty smoothness). I just don't understand the hype...but I'd recommend getting a Batch#1 over a #2 in any case.  2013 batch shared side-by-side with mocha wednesday and BT Pours a bit darker than Black Tuesday, very dark brown, some sediment, razor thin head around the perimeter. The nose had a potently aromatic vanilla, some deeper chocolate notes, prune as it warms, caramel sweetness, hints of alcohol. The taste has a big chocolatey sweetness and burning ethanol in the finish. The mouthfeel is sweet, but has a vanilla and chocolate presence that cuts through the ethanol (especially compared to Black Tuesday). It's not as thick and full bodied as expected, but the alcohol is well masked, even when it warms. This beer is noticeably better than the base, really drinkable considering the abv and heavy flavors",0.673244499208547,4.0,0.9919
Chocolate Rain,"Re-review of fresh 2015 vintage.  Thought 2014 was fantastic, but this was on another level - one of the greatest stouts I've had.  Tons of fresh vanilla bean, marshmallow, and chocolate - but it is not too sweet, a lot of booze and whiskey. Has an old ale quality I think is in all the huge bruery stouts - toffee, caramel, oak barrel. Follows suit on the palate - explosive strong flavor, rich boozy sweetness, tons of vanilla bean, chocolate and whiskey.  Phenomenal beer, though not in appearance,, the adjuncts add flavor and some sweetness but do not cover up the base whiskey stout. The vanilla and marshmallow integrate naturally with the existing bourbon sweetness. Best BT variation.",0.6583788188403767,4.75,0.9919
Haze,"Pours hazy yellow orange. Great looking beer.   The smell is a ton of tropical notes. Mango, passion fruit with some tangerine. Fantastic smell to it.   The taste is just how the smell set it up. Great citrusy fruits flavor. Tastes like it’s be soaking in mango and tangerine. Love the taste.   The feel is as good as it gets. So clean and smooth. Each sip is so clean and crisp. The entire beer remains so consistent.  So impressed with this beer on so many levels. This lives up to the hype for sure. Amazed how well put together this is.",0.6723484799085169,4.5,0.9919
Juicy,"375ml split with Morningthief. Served in a wine glass.  Appearance: Cloudy orange. Gushed when served slightly cold, but didn't lose much. Decent lacing.  Smell: I hate to sound like an asshole, but the aroma transported me to some sort of ocean of citrus. So full that it's not like a ""note"" or ""smells like grapefruit,"" but ""bustling citrus market located on a boat in some sort of verdant pond in the rainforest."" Brett funk underneath the grapefruit and lime. Just amazing.  Taste: Almost as good as the aroma. Harsh bitterness that usually ruins pale beers like this, but balances with the firm brett and big hits of citrus. Lives up to its name; like magic fruit and wild yeast juice.   No confusing this with Russian River or Cantillon. Not minerally. Sour but smoothed over completely by big hop and yeast flavor--it's the picture of balance (like most Hill Farmstead beers) save for overreaching in a good way with the citrus flavors.  Definite winner. Worth seeking out if you chase interesting beers.  Mouthfeel: Very good. Not world class, but doesn't get in the way, and it is indeed nice and juicy.  Overall: Another fine, fine beer from Hill Farmstead. Especially interesting for the way it balances high bitterness; this exact bitterness has ruined other sours and BSPAs for me (as stated in several reviews, actually), but here it's a perfect element. Great stuff.",0.6937142790079791,4.75,0.9919
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"L-Beautiful hazy golden yellow beer. S- Lots of fermentation to me. Haven't had much of this style, but I get strong strong notes of yeast, banana, and clove. Powerful smelling beer that is almost overwhelmed by the scent of yeast. T-Much sweeter than expected at first, then once I continued to sip it became less and less sweet and more mellow and yeasty. I get notes of banana in this beer, also clove. Very pleasant and wonderfully put together. MF- mellow and slight carbonation that makes for a very well balanced and drinkable beer. O- Well crafted and neatly balanced beer. A pure joy to drink for a very likable price range. Will seek out again.",0.7076800377951769,4.0,0.9919
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"It was the first one served in a tasting of international beers, and it is said is one of the best of its kind, so I was pretty eager to try it. I was uninpressed by it. A good beer overall, but I expected more of it.   We tasted it in the proper glass, and it was served around 7ºC, so optimal conditions. We let it rest a couple of minutes before drinking it and it developed about 2cm of a thick white head/collar.  Charged with cereal aroma, it was too alcoholic on nose for me.  On mouth though, things started to improve: overall good, with cereal taste clearly distinguished within it. With a great mouthfeel, on par with other wheat beers, even better.  A good beer for casual drinking or a tasting. Would recommend.",0.6383800168034219,3.75,0.9918
Black Tuesday,"color of the beer is black as night, pours a few big bubbles on top but not really any head to speak of. Smell-tons of malt goodness, rich coffee, some chocolate, dark fruit, boozy warmth. Taste-Upfront is sweet malt flavors such as molasses and dark fruit, complimented by rich, toasty flavors like chocolate and coffee. the booze provides warmth but is very, very subtle for a beer this big. Feel-very heavy, oily on the finish. very subtle carbonation. Overall-this is an extremely impressive beer, drink carefully, you can't really taste the 18.9 percent abv but it's there!",0.6804520631389829,4.75,0.9918
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Enjoyed on-tap at DLD.  Poured in a little plastic cup, I would have transferred it to my sampling glass but a few of us bought several glasses of each to pass around, so it stayed in the plastic.  The stuff is rich and black, just a wisp or two of mocha around the edge.  It smells richly of roasted malts, espresso, and the with the certainty of oak. Not as stunning as the vanilla variant but good in its own right.  Tastes like Dark Lord would - rich with dark malt and bitter chocolate, but with an oak edge that is very nice. The wood pushes the sweetness of the beer back a little, providing some nice balance. Lots of espresso and booziness on the swallow, and a long finish of the same. The thickness of the beer helps it hang around, also subduing carbonation somewhat.  An awesome part of the day, we had one and ordered three more.",0.6635035741353399,4.5,0.9918
Sang Noir,"Poured into a tulip. 2011 vintage.  3.75 A: Pours a deep plum color. Some yeasties hanging out at the bottom of the glass. One finger of frothy beige head. Retention is about average and a half finger of lacing is left.  3.75 S: Well, this definitely has some cherries in it. Big, bold, beautiful cherries. Tart and delicious. I'm not detecting much bourbon at this point, but the barrel itself is quite present lending a soft tannic woodiness. Not much funk as this more showcases tartness and sour punches. Nice acetic acidity. Toastiness, mixed berries, sour plum, and a touch of lemon.   3.75 T: This pretty much mirrors the nose. Big, bold cherry. Moderate sour tanginess with plenty of tartness. Lemon, plum, black and blueberries. Toastiness, touch of neutral maltiness. Bit of earthy funk.  3.75 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation with a light spritziness. Super smooth with a tart finish.  4.00 D: Very good beer. Didn't get much bourbon, but that's probably a good thing since it didn't need any other flavors.",0.6778524084613289,4.5,0.9918
Fort Point Pale Ale,"Canned 04/13/17, it pours cloudy orange color with a 2 finger foamy white head that's full of bubbles of all sizes, dissipating slowly and leaving really good spotty lacing.  APA??...could have fooled me. This leans more towards an IPA with an aroma of orange peel, lemon zest, grapefruit, biscuit, fresh citrus hops, papaya, piney hops, caramel, toasted grains, coriander and floral notes. Well balanced with a lot of fresh hops, tropical fruit and a nice malty backbone, this would pass as an impressive IPA so in the pale ale class it's top notch.  Tastes just like it smells with grapefruit, orange peel, fresh citrus hops, lemon zest, pineapple, caramel, and piney hops followed by a malty sweetness that brings graham cracker, biscuit, light brown sugar, wheat bread, toasted grains and finally some mild spices like pepper and coriander. It fades clean and dry with near perfect balance of those bready flavors, pungent citrus and floral notes.   Mouthfeel crisp and smooth at the same time, with average carbonation, a medium body and a perfect level of hoppy bitterness that masks the ABV and makes it extremely easy to drink. A year round session beer that's full of flavor.  Overall this is up there with Zombie Dust at the top of the mountain. Happy to finally have gotten a 4 pack of it as this has been on my BeerAdvocate ""Want"" list since 03-21-2015. An outstanding beer, world class indeed.",0.6893027758740538,5.0,0.9918
Darkstar November,"Beer pours pitch and oily thick with a dark khaki that forms a two inch that dissipates in due time. It leaves a multi mm thick ring around the glass. Smell is heavily barrel forward when cold but as the beer warms, the molasses starts smacking you in the face. There is a slightly spicy note from the rye and a hint of alcohol. The taste of the beer is deep with the molasses syrupy sweetness coming through at the trail end. There is sweetness to the beer but it is just right and not overtly so at all. There is a nice roasted malt note to the beer that remains the predominant flavor. The sweetness of the molasses and the spiciness of the rye balance out the entire thing nicely. The feel on this beer is superb. Thick and silky smooth. Overall this beer is great. Another hit from Bottle Logic. Balanced, yummy, and just right.",0.6938713419458451,4.75,0.9918
Sang Noir,"750ml to a snifter, 2011 vintage. Got this for xmas from my sister in pdx last year, been staring at it in my fridge for 365 days, let's open this guy  Cork pops off very easily. Pours a dark ruby with two fingers of slightly burgundy foam. pretty high carbonation, ridiculous retention rate with great lacing. A little fizzy, but this is a really good looking beer   Smells of vinegar, tart cherries, sour apples and grape, wine, oak, leather, a tiny bit of bourbon and a ouch of alcohol. Really fun to smell   Taste is right with the nose, sour cherries and an assortment of other fruits- apple, peach, and grape with strong vinegar, oak, bourbon, wine, and alcohol. The taste sort of evolves as it goes over the palate  Feel is initial face puckering sour that neutralizes and turns a little sweet on the finish. Medium sticky body. Really easy to sip on  Overall one of the better Cascades I've had. Really great beer, glad I got another of last years vintage",0.6308751225675365,4.5,0.9918
Madagascar,"Enjoyed out of a 22 oz bomber from Batch 3 (2016) and reviewed from notes after drinking it on 5/4/2016. Poured into an oversized brandy snifter.  Appearance (4.0) - A pitch black body topped by a fleeting half finger head that disappears almost immediately. Just pinstripe-thin ringlet of tan suds around the edge of the glass and a single dollop of film in the middle of the surface of the liquid. No lacing or legs to speak of.   Smell (4.25) - Pretty nice aroma wafting out of the glass, with the sweetness of lactose and vanilla beans hitting my nose first, followed by some bittersweet chocolate and light bourbon caramel sweetness shortly thereafter. As it warms, the vanilla and bourbon become a little more prevalent, creating a nice sweet aroma with a pinch of astringent booze on the finish.  Taste (4.0) - I have to admit, I'm a little underwhelmed here. I know this bottle is now about four months old, but it's just not as decadent or rich as I was hoping/expecting. The flavors are all there--vanilla, chocolate, bourbon, light bitterness--but in the end it's just a good barrel-aged stout with vanilla bean. On the taste, the vanilla isn't quite as dominant as it was in the aroma, which allows the base milk stout to come through a little more, and gives the barrel-aging a little more leeway as well. Slight alcohol astringency on the finish, but overall, the taste is sweet.  Mouthfeel (4.0) - Medium body, although it seems light to my palate, given the style of beer. Carbonation is moderate to light. I think the body may be where my issues with this beer are rooted.  Overall (4.0), it is a very good beer, but I can't help but feel that it fell short of what I was looking for. I'll fully admit that my disappointment may come from chasing this beer for a year before finally happening upon a bottle in a pretty easy trade, but there are simply other vanilla bean imperial stouts (and no, I'm not talking about VR) or even porters that I'd take ahead of this one. I can think of about three off the top of my head. That said, I do want to reiterate that this is far from a bad beer. It's actually quite delicious and if someone offered me a pour or bottle in the future, or I randomly came across it on tap, I'd drink my fill and enjoy it immensely.",0.6539215722231346,4.0,0.9918
Black Tuesday,"Big thanks to ObeMaltKinobee and mrbubbler for hooking me up with bottles of this. I've been intimidated by this one for some time now but after a crazy weekend, it's Black Tuesday time.  Appearance. Pours a deep dark brown, almost black in the glass but not quite. There's a collar of khaki head, but that's about it. Looks pretty ominous.  Smell. Chocolate liquer, some coffee and oaky vanilla. There's a little sweet coconut there as well. Lots and lots of booze.  Taste. Nice bourbon and sweet chocolate, some coconut and vanilla with a good amount of fresh and clean oak barrel. Insanely high alcohol is dangerously well hidden.  Mouthfeel. Full body and warm, but not very sticky considering the substantial sweetness.   Overall. Fantastic stuff. It's a sipper for sure, but amazingly drinkable for the crazy abv. Tackling this one solo, wish me luck!",0.6456922859376129,4.5,0.9918
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"A big thanks to Dan for this one. 12oz. capped bottle into a Cigar City snifter. Shared with schen9303.   Looks pretty average. Nice lace. Nose is one of the more unique ones I've come across in a coffee stout. Notes of roast, smoke, bacon, maple, chocolate, fudge and oak in the back. Strangely, there's some hash in there also. Pretty awesome though a bit mellow. Flavor is of chocolate, roast, maple syrup, molasses and espresso in the back. Sweet booze and fudge too. Chewy with a nice bit of heat at the end. Delicious! The feel is spot on also. Slick with just the slightest tickle of bubbles. Rich and heavy on the palate without being overwhelming.   I'm a huge fan of coffee imperial stouts and this one's right up there with the best of them for me. Definitely worth seeking out.",0.6428494039092052,4.5,0.9917
Todd The Axe Man,"Appearance: Pours a deep golden-orange color with an SRM of 10. A strong white head, that fades pretty quickly. (3.75)  Aroma: Huge aromatic grapefruit, lemon, pineapple, and orange citrus. Even some sweet mandarin orange, and tangerine. . A little pineapple, peach and mango. Don't be fooled. Then comes the mosaic with huge, dank tropical melon and berry. A delicious, rich, sweet, pale-bread maltiness underneath it all. (4.5)  Flavor: The flavors have huge citrus of lemon, orange, grapefruit rind, and pineapple. A touch of peach and mango with some stonefruit marmalade. Again, then strong, dank tropical melon and berry flavors, but not even close to bitter enough to be black tea. Not much pine either. The sweet white bread malts come through for a rather sweet finish. Leans slightly sweet. (4.25)  Feel: Full-bodied, good carbonation. Slightly resinous and oily. Yet, crisp and not creamy. A blueberry flavor lingers on the tongue afterwards, but it's more of a flavor and not all that bitter. (4.25)  Compared with Furious, this one is much lighter colored and clearer. Much stronger citrus and juicy flavor. More sweet orange and pineapple sweetness. Less pine flavor. More of a malt body and is sweeter. Less bitterness, pine and black tea. Leans further east and is more fruity.  Compared with King Sue: This one has a darker orange color. Much stronger berry and dank tropical profile from the mosaic. Its heavier bodied. More oily and crisp. Less creamy. Stronger bitterness.  Overall: Man this is a good IPA. It leans sweeter, and light juice flavors. Tons of fruity and juicy flavor. Really showcases the Citra and Mosaic combo. Tons of fruity flavor like a NEIPA, but it maintains a respectable citrus, dank and pithy fruit flavors of the west-coast, while finishing with the balance of a mid-west IPA. This beer might set the standard for a midwest IPA. (Final Rating: 4.33)",0.6911201986116927,4.5,0.9917
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2002 label 2004 cork- Thanks to translucent for this one!  Pours a light layer of pink hued white head. Color is a grapefruit ruby red.  Aroma: Huge raspberry! Crazy for being that old. Dusty, musty raspberries. Very funky and fruity. Cobwebs and wet basement. Oak barrels show as well.  Taste: This is one the sourest beers I have ever had... more sour than Riserva '10. Just intense. Mouth puckering. Oak flavors shows. It also has an old, musty flavor. Cobweb and basement. Vinegar. The raspberries don't show as much, but I still taste the fruit. Big acidic kick! So intense.  Mouthfeel: Sour, tart, intense. Lighter bodied with a lower amount of carbonation. Ends pretty clean.  Overall, this was a great beer. It was amazingly sour and tart. So mouth-watering. A very well done beer. Cantilllon has done it again!  Edit: have had some fresher bottles (and older vintages) and the raspberries are always there on this beer. It isn't as sour as I remember it being. It is incredibly juicy and fruity. Such a treat. ____________ 2003 sticker consumed 12/17 Light pink head. Golden dark raspberry color. Not the typical purple pink color.  Raspberries are on point. So many seeds. Tart and acidic, but not over the top at all. Fairly balanced for how old it is. Was expecting a ton of sour, but got so much raspberry. Oak with a little funk. Lemon citrus. Reminds me a little of raspberry lemonade. A very nice bottle, lucky to have this treat. 4.6 __ 15 Sticker consumed 12/18 Jammy raspberry seeds and a touch of almonds. Hints of medicinal notes. Light funk, light citrus. Drinking nicely so fresh. 4.4",0.6653526541787336,4.5,0.9917
Sang Noir,"750ml bottle into snifter. “2011 Project.”  A: Pours a deep dark mahogany color with barely any light brown fizzy active head. Just the faintest collar stuck around the edge of the glass after the head disappeared. No or almost no lace.  S: Very musty and oak-dominate nose, but there is a nice amount of “red” fruits and tannic cherry pits. The nose is rich and complex, with layers of greasy oak, faint whisky, musty attic, vinous red wine, caramel, juicy cherry, and a hint of powdery chocolate.  T: Exceptionally smooth and rich flavors of greasy oak and sweet cherry, damp musty basement, slightly tart red berries, red wine barrel and greasy caramel. The finish has hints of spicy, and the aftertaste is drying with gritty, cleaning tannins.  M: Full bodied with a smooth and greasy mouthfeel overall, but the finish is drying and tannic. The tartness is also very prominent but not overly acidic, vinegary or harsh at all. Very easy to drink as the tartness gives away to sweet sugariness and dryness in the finish.  O: One of the better sours I’ve had in recent memory. This is exceptionally smooth and easy to drink for being so complex and tart. The greasy oak and slick, sweet, cherry flavors come through perfectly.",0.7033546629775899,4.5,0.9917
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"11.2oz bottle - no discernible date - poured into a flared pint at 44F.  Pours a fully cloudy honey golden, with three fingers of completely dense, fiamy white head, which holds its shape for several minutes.  Nose: Sweet, soft, creamy wheat grain, with an incredible classic yeast aroma - bringing an explosion of bubblegum, a hint of clove, unripe banana, and some fruity undertones atop a warm loaf of fresh bread. There's the faintest suggestion of orange rind and some mulling spice tucked in as well.  Palate: First sip brings that creamy grainy wheat flavour, with surprisingly little sweetness. The fruity yeast esters follow, with more bubblegum, faint clove, green banana, apple, faint clove, and some German hop florals. It's very clean, crisp, and tame. There's a subtle spicy kick before the finish, which brings more bubblegum, wheat grain, German hop notes, lots of clove, and a very toned -down bitterness compared to American hefewiezens.   Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is fairly light in body - crisp - with a noticeable softness to the feel. The soft wheat coats yhe tongue, and gives some nice texture. Effervescence is lively, but not aggressive or prickly. Everything feels appropriate for the style.  Overall: Hefeweizens are not a favourite style of mine. Nevertheless, I try to look at everything as objectively as I can. This is probably the most enjoyable hefeweizen I've had this far. It feela incredibly refined and complete, with no rough edges or off flavours. Unlike many American offerings, it isn't over-hopped or spiced in any way. It isn't a complex beer whatsoever. It isn't wildly unique or groundbreaking. It's a very classic style, after all. It is, on the other hand, a really great example of beer in its most simple, classic, original form. A true German offering. It may not br a glass to dive in and study, but it sure hits the spot when you want a cold beer, and this will certainly pair very nicely with many dishes.",0.7216411585218444,4.0,0.9917
Aaron,"Pours a dark brown color with a small beige head, collapsing to a small ring of lacing.  Smells of toffee, melting caramel, rose water, toasty oak and a hint of molasses. This is definitely on the sweeter side, with a rustic, wheat and malt backbone, adding a nice depth to the aromas. Develops a strong bourbon presence, which goes perfectly well with the other components of the nose.  Drinks fairly thick and silk, with almost no carbonation, revealing the beers heavy body in a perfect way.  Tastes of sweet toffee from the beginning with an additional caramel sweetness on top, balanaced only by the uprising oak. Develops a note of tobacco, once the barrel grows more prominent, with an almost smoky decadence. The focus maintains on the sweetness, defined by honey in this stage, while the dry bourbon acts as a well working counterpart.   This is sticky and overboarding with a well working balance. Once its sweetness is established, slowly the boozy oak barrel settles in to add a pleasant complexity, making this a nice, powerful sipper.",0.7167428248634488,4.0,0.9917
Juicy,"Thanks to Josh for this one. Shared at a tasting 12/8. 5oz pour into a snifter. Reviewed from notes.   Pours a light, thin white ring of carbonation. Beer is clear bronze. Spotty lace with decent stick. Not great for the style.   Nose is passion fruit, citrus, pineapple, and other tropical fruit with cane sugar sweetness. Really good!  Opens yeasty. Citrus, passion fruit, light tartness balanced by a mild, yeast and hop bitterness. Big tropical fruit notes throughout make this one almost IIPA like but with a saison-y spicy finish. Interesting.   Light bodied with ample carbonation. Spritzy in the mouth and crisp and quenching going down. Dry finish with a dry aftertaste. Very good.   Pretty good overall and just like mimosa, very aptly named. However, also like mimosa, I wouldn't rank this among the best saison's HF makes. Flavor profile is interesting but this just doesn't stand out to me. I'm glad I got to try it but I wouldn't go through the trouble of seeking this out myself.",0.6971258230428142,4.0,0.9917
Fort Point Pale Ale,"Swung by Trillium on the way through Boston. Grabbed a 4 pack of these along with some other goodies. Can dated 6/5/19 and poured into a tulip glass.  L: Deep wheat/orange with a good 2 inches of froth that sticks around for a little bit but quickly fades.   S: Deep mango richness - tropical bubble gum and some citrus zest. Quite aromatic - you can smell the beer after you pour. Almost a bit of peach.  T: To me, the taste doesn't necessarily follow the nose of this beer. I taste lots of rind, some pine, and a bit of zip that isn't exactly peppery but something to that effect. A bit of an alcohol burn/taste that is a little unusual - perhaps a unique batch?  F: Another review mentioned effervescent, and that is a great description. Along with the high level of carbonation, its pretty zesty.  O: A nice APA, although it definitely reminds me more of a NE IPA. Great aroma but I didn't find this as easy to drink as many of the other great NE IPAs out there these days. I'm sure that Trillium has several others that are stronger than this offering.",0.6562597814944529,4.0,0.9917
Sang Noir,"2015 Project No bottling date, but bought in late 2016  Appearance- Pours a deep dark mahogany color, ruby red highlights, fairly transparent when held to light. Finger thick, soapy, off-white colored head. Small amount of spotty head lacing on glass.  Aroma- Tart cherries, blackberries, grapeskins, mildly sour fruit notes. Soft oak, earthy and funky, vinous wine notes. Very mild bourbon notes and some hints of vanilla.   Taste- Juicy, tart cherries, berries, sour fruits. Rich malty and fruity sweetness balances tartness. Vinous, red wine notes, oaky, earthy. Soft, sweet bourbon, vanilla. Finishes w/ slight acidity and crisp tart fruitiness.  Feel- Medium bodied, crisp tartness but not overly sour, has a balancing sweetness throughout. Crisp, clean carbonation, palate cleansing.  Overall- Beer shows such a bold tartness and sweetness, yet excellently balanced and restrained. Wine and bourbon barrels come through with such a soft touch, neither overpowering eachother or the beer, but adding such depth and complexity. An excellently crafted beer.",0.7249971094870071,4.5,0.9917
Nelson,"22oz bomber best by 24 May 2016. Poured into a tulip glass. Look: A glowing tangerine, sunny yellow, with one finger of bright white pillowy head that fades rather quickly, leaving light sticky lacing. Looks gorgeous. Smell: Tangerines and tropical fruits, slight dankness, sweet and juicy and dry white wine, crackery malt background supporting the lovely New Zealand Nelson hops. Taste: White wine and ripe juicy green grapes, tropical fruits and citrus, tangerine and nectarine, grapefruit and wonderfully juicy juicy! You get a little bit of that dankness riding the sweet and light crackery backbone with a pop of rye spice that is so nice. The bitterness is so soft and balanced with the spiciness of the rye and juiciness that just makes my mouth water wanting more and more. Perfect representation of the Nelson hops. Feel: Coats the mouth with a wonderful light/medium carb and medium body. Juicy sticky hop goodness that lingers with the soft bitterness that fades every so nicely. One of the best mouthfeels of a beer that I have had the pleasure to enjoy. Overall: Absolutely wonderful. The taste is a pop of spice and juicy hops that is stronger than the subtle nose would suggest. A very pleasant surprise and treat of a beer to enjoy. I’ve had this on tap as well, but actually enjoyed it from the bottle much more.",0.6942547813795454,4.75,0.9917

Green,"tree house nails the grain makeups of these hazy beers, i think thats what sets them apart, and while it seems weird to call out the grain first in an ipa like this that is so brilliantly hoppy and bright, i think its the support and balance from the malts, and the smooth frothing texture they provide, that make these tree house beers in a league of their own. i feel like the hopping times and ratios and everything can be easily repeated, but its these mashes that are unique to me. this one is a little thicker than some of the others in appearance, paler whiter straw color with a creamy and tall white head. the nose is all hops, mosaic and galaxy maybe, slight cat pee to it for a second but then a ton of melon and pineapple and even mango, vegetal and green but without the burn so many of these that have too many hops in them have, white grape, a cool almost jelly bean sort of candied orange thing, and a remarkable freshness. its juicy to the highest degree, but uniquely balanced by the grain in a way that we rarely see in these hazy ipa types. super fresh, supremely well carbonated, a long flavor journey, and a on of depth to both the malt base and the hop profile. stupidly drinkable for its size too. thanks to my homie back east for sending out some of these cans, i have been loving all of them and learning for myself that they hype is well warranted!",0.6847235286933536,4.25,0.9916
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Bottle split between four people at the brewery a few months ago. Reviewed from notes. Pours a wonderful red color with excellent clarity. A small pink tinted head forms and has pretty nice retention and lacing for a lambic. A wonderful but intensely funky aroma from the brett. Lots of lactic sourness and of course, a huge raspberry smell. A touch of oak in the background as well (something that adds to the complexity of the Lou Pepe beers) This is one of the best things that has ever entered my mouth. Lots of complex, funky flavors. Medium high sourness, huge raspberry flavor, a touch of vanilla. Musty, earthy, fruity. Dry but still rich thanks to all the complex flavors.   As someone who loves raspberries, this is the best Cantillon beer I've tried. Phenomenal.",0.7066138716658518,4.75,0.9916
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"apparently one of the harder to find beers from these guys, and it is a real beauty. this is the 2010 vintage. it pours a cloudy pale red color, like a strawberry frosted donut, with some suspended yeast and only a small white head that settles quickly. the nose is the classic kriek smell, tart cherries, sour yeasty notes, and some mild residual sugar. the flavor is surprisingly not sweet, and it finishes dryer, which I really like in this kriek as opposed to others. the cherry flavor is very authentic and up front, but it doesn't dominate the funky yeast lambic essentials. in other words, its in wonderful balance. the finish is super sour, more so than I remember in any other kriek ive had, this one zaps all the moisture right out of my mouth. better carbonation than you gather from the appearance, and a light enough body, with hardly any sugar left over when you swallow. its really got an extraordinary mouthfeel. this is by far the best kriek ive had, its quality and tradition shine through. still, this is a style of beer that is hard for me to drink too much of, so I was fortunate enough to have a lot of friends, old and new on hand to share this with.",0.6676707888621803,4.25,0.9916
Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,"Smell: this super barrel forward huge oak and bourbon. Vanilla toasted coconut. Rich milk chocolate dark chocolate some dark fruit as well. Literally smells like a 3 year old aged BCBS.  Taste: initially this just smacks you in the face with bourbon and barrel notes. Smooth bourbon and oak upfront middle of the mouth big mix of rich milk and dark chocolate vanilla some dark cherry in the finish you get more of that dark cherry and dark fruit notes figs raisin that mix with more of that smooth bourbon and oak flavor. The finish is in your face with booze soaked dark fruits. I mean the whole beer is in your face. This taste so much like bourbon County but even a little more intense and in your face.   Feel: it's full bodied, rich and silky smooth on the tongue. Medium high amount of alcohol heat but it works. This is a mans beer sip and enjoy!  Overall: This is as intense in your face bourbon barrel Stout as I've ever had. Boozy and super barrel forward with nice chocolate and dark fruit notes.

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2007 Vintage opened and enjoyed for my girlfriend's 25th Birthday.  A- Absolutely gorgeous deep red with a hint of purple. Pours with a nice 1 and half finger pink colored head that quickly dissipates to nothing. This is really unique and interesting looking beer.  S- HUGE bouquet of tart raspberries up front. Strong smell of oak and plenty of funk and acid help add to complexity of the aroma.This thing smells freaking heavenly.   T- A little less raspberries here than I expected, though I'm not complaining. This one is pretty tart up front followed by plenty of raspberry aroma that almost tricks you into thinking its sweet, though its not at all. Lots of oak and complex flavors from the spontaneous fermentation.   M- Lots of lively carbonation.   O- Awesome beer. My first framboise and what a great one! I'll be locating some more asap.",0.6607627494438119,4.5,0.9915
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Split my buddy's bottle at his bachelor party. Poured into a Cigar City snifter.  Motor oil pour as is typical with good DL vintages. Jet black with a small tan ring of foam leaving some legs down the glass though the retention fades a bit.  Big bourbon notes up front in the aroma. Dark fruit, wood, chocolate and burnt malts.  Again barrel stands out in the taste. Bourbon is nicely integrated and smooth. Toasted oak, vanilla, dark chocolate, fudge and roasted malts play a part with some dark fruit in the background.  As with something that pours like motor oil, mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Carbonation levels low, but still present. Alcohol is felt, but very well integrated.  Surprisingly enjoyed this one much more than the Vanilla I had a few months ago. My main complaint with regular DL is the intense sweetness and the bourbon does a wonderful job of cutting through and balancing this beer. At the same time, there is enough sweetness that the bourbon doesn't come in too hot. Fantastic beer and hope they make this variant again (and I have better luck) next time around.",0.6662505872985776,5.0,0.9915
Enjoy By IPA,"Enjoy By 04.20.16 bottled 03.15.16  Easily the best DIPA that i've had since I got turned onto the style, comes in an absolutely beautiful bottle that you really can't wait to open upon first sighting it in the store. I had the pleasure of spotting one in the singles cooler at my local bottle shop, have waited until i've had a few to give it a review. Pours with a thick white head which settles into a gorgeous thin layer of foam on top of this golden beauty. The smell of tropical fruit is strong and helps mask the massive 9.4% alcohol that you're about to consume. Lifting the glass to your lips, it starts with intense hops and bitterness, finishing dry and boozy as it goes down. Adjusting to the bitterness, you really start to get the citrus notes coming through and it turns into a truly amazing DIPA from a truly amazing brewery.",0.640498169375027,4.75,0.9915
Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,"375 ml bottle into snifter, 2018 vintage bottling. Pours dense pitch black color with a minimal spotty lace cap. Minimal lacing with some clinging bubbles on the glass. Aromas of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, and dark bread; with lighter notes of coconut, licorice, raisin, prune, fig, date, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, pepper, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Lightly increasing booze in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malts and bourbon barrel notes; with big strength. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, and dark bread; with lighter notes of coconut, licorice, raisin, prune, fig, date, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, pepper, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Very mild herbal/roast/char bitterness and bourbon/oak tannin spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, dark bread, coconut, licorice, dark fruit, light smoke/char/pepper, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts and bourbon barrel flavors; with a solid roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with no cloying, acrid, astringent flavors after the finish. Slightly increasing dryness from lingering roast bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness. Light carbonation and very full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety, and slightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is amazing. Mildly increasing warmth of 13.5%, with no barrel booziness lingering after the finish. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged imperial stout! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV; with the very mildly bitter/tannic/drying finish. Insanely rich malt complexity, with perfect barrel integration/balance. Not overly roasty/charred on malts, or boozy/tannic on barrels. A highly amazing offering, and top tier style example as expected.",0.6670333683400397,4.5,0.9915
Scaled Up,"Thanks Kevin for the gifted bottle.  A- 750ml into dual tulips with a fairly hazy golden-orange body and a pinky high frothy, thick white cap. Good head retention as it dies eventually to a wide ring and lacing starts as thick sheets. Drizzled patches decorate most of the glass.  S- Tropical and stone fruit nectars with some citrus, pine and floral beyond that. Juicy mango, papaya, peach, cantaloupe and melons along with slight orange and grapefruit. Even by today's standards very clean for 8% ABV as the hops are the sole act.  T- Rides on the waves of the aroma with plentiful notes of peach, mango, apricot and papaya; the same tropical stone fruit juiciness. Gains some more hop complexity with bitter orange peel and grapefruit pith more noticeable. Also supremely dank in the flavor with more melon and sticky herbs coming to mind. Slightly sweet with a whisper of cereal.  MF- Puffy and creamy body with just a touch of chew to it. Silky wheat smoothness. Overall it is towards the thick end of the spectrum and it finishes with a dank herbal bitterness lingering on the palate. Like the fluffiest most comfortable blanket you can imagine.  While it seems nowadays like you can go anywhere around New England and find a great IPA, Trillium certainly has risen up there with the best of them and their signature is all over this one. Even with hundreds of good IPAs on the market around 8% this one really does drink like a true juice; didn't miss a beat at Canton, perhaps even better!",0.6782943519392629,4.75,0.9915
Black Tuesday,"2016 bottle with a local buddy.  We both poured into snifters. My observations are as follows. The appearance was a jet black color with a whiff of a little off white foamy head that slid off at a steady pace. Lace seemed spotty and swiftly flowed into the beer without any cling. The aroma had some dark fruits, vanilla bean, molasses, sweet clean driftwood, milk chocolate, glazed cake, bourbon notes, and a touch of earthiness. The flavor leaned into that sweet character to bring about the earthiness and dried sweet woody character to evenly set the pace from sweet to dry tones running into the aftertaste nicely. The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a fair sipping quality about it. Alcohol notes seem to be flowing fairly strong. Carbonation felt nice and fine. Seemed to be falling off, perhaps just a touch. Overall, pretty fantastic Imperial stout well worthy of having again. Would be a fantastic Winter sipper.",0.7052114958590522,4.5,0.9915

Madagascar,"Thanks to @choobaccaHB for sharing this gorgeous drink  Pours deep mahogany. Head is minuscule and soon disappears. Nose is gracefully complex. Rich, deep vanilla that is not overwhelming. I must disclose vanilla as a dominant note tends to be a negative for me, but this one is rounded and smooth, yet ever present. Also, gentle bourbon, hints of cocoa, and maybe marshmallow.  Taste is sublime. Like the nose, the vanilla is a constant yet it sashays with numerous partners. The cocoa is the strongest, and alludes to deep buttery brownies. The bourbon takes turns, especially in the swallow, bringing sweetness infused with slight char. And marshmallow hovers and retreats and taps in shyly. Madagascar is gently ""warm."" No burn, just a warn hug to the back of the mouth. The flavors really go back and forth. As it warms, the bourbon approaches parity with the cocoa.  Mouthfeel is perfect, creamy yet some heft. Glorious Drink.",0.6822081458546553,4.25,0.9914
Sang Noir,"The inside of a barrel isn't a very nice place. It's dark and musty, full of nauseating fumes, and houses rogue bacteria and microscopic critters in every crevasse. In many cases, you're stuck in there with rotting, festering fruits. Despite all this, Sang Noir came out more than a year later looking pretty good; its tone is dark but not muddied and impressively maintains a bit of its garnet highlighting. Even some head too.   The aroma combines epic proportions of sweetness and tartness to create a bouquet of unparalleled complexity; it's rare to find this much of either, let alone both together in the same beer. Immediate impressions of berry gummies and candied cherries quickly turn tart and gradually evolve into a unique convolution of fruit, oak, bourbon, and pinot noir.   Saying that Sang Noir is like a candy factory crossed with a fruit orchard crossed with a winery is a huge injustice to an incredibly elaborate beer. But it's a good place to start when embarking on the near impossible task of describing the multiplicity of flavours that comprise this rich and mesmerizing offering.   I'm first impressed by just how mellow the beer drinks. High-alcohol, barrel-aged offerings tend to fall prey to one or the other of nauseating booziness, acidity that singes your throat, a woodiness that leaves splinters in your gums, or a tartness so severe in turns your lips inside out (assuming the whole thing comes together well enough so as to be palatable in the first place). But Sang Noir has all the intricacy without any of the intensity.   What's in the glass is mysterious and distinctive, the result of a very long and difficult process - it makes the Coca-Cola recipe seem easy to crack by comparison. Notes of maddeningly red cherries, vanilla cola, caramel, sarsaparilla, acidic lemon, purple plum, heavy wood and spices are melodiously woven together. Notably absent are any harsh alcohol notes (an impressive feat considering the whiskey barrels and the 9.5% of the beer itself).   Cascade Sang Noir (""black blood"") indeed drinks like some kind of dark, mystical gospel. A beer this intricate and transcendental is the stuff of folkloric legends. Of course, given how difficult it is to find (and expensive to buy) it may only ever be fantasy for most people. For those of you fortunate enough to come across this dream beer, be sure to enjoy it with someone you really want to impress (i.e, your favourite person in the world).",0.6753913715571588,4.5,0.9914
Fort Point Pale Ale,"Poured from a 16 oz can,into a Cigar City spiegelau IPA glass.Canned on APR/26/17.  L- Thick soapy white colored head that stands 2 finger widths tall,with good retention and thick sticky lacing.Deep hazy straw colored body,with light orange hues.Low clarity through the glass,with distorted light showing through.Medium amount of carbonation,with some sediment.  S- On the nose I get heavy amounts of citrus and tropical fruit hops.Peaches, grapefruit, mango,pineapple are all in the forefront.Bright notes of sweet malt,white wheat,and bright barley are there for a beautiful balance.This APA smells wonderful.  T- The palate follows the nose perfectly.Up front I get light pine needle,mango fruit,and peaches.In the middle I get sweet malts,and grapefruit citrus.On the back end I get pineapple, white wheat,and the pine hops return.The citrus is dank and zesty.This beer tastes amazing!!!  F- The mouth feel is silky and smooth,with moderate oxidation on the tongue.Moderately dry finish,that leaves the slightest chalky texture after the sip.  O- I have seen and heard alot about this beer prior to drinking it,and it definitely lived up to the hype.This is by far my favorite APA out of all the ones I have tried so far.Looks great,smells and tastes great,perfectly balanced.This beer is the total package.Just enough bitterness,mixed with fruity hops,dankness,and light sweet malts.I could drink this beer all year long,and probably will seeing as it is only 40 minutes away.If you love a hoppy / dank APA then I would definitely recommend you get your hands on this one,by any means necessary.I can't wait to get back out to the brewery in Canton,MA.",0.6697938498618138,4.75,0.9913
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"I am going to need to revisit all my prior ratings as this one literally does take the cake! With so much hype yet it completely lives up to it. Shared by a great beer friend, 2016 vintage into smaller taster. Nose was simply incredible, super chocolaty, slight maple sweetness and subtle barrel oak and char notes. Thick and viscous pour and close to pitch black. Tastes likes bittersweet bakers chocolate liquefied and infused with rich sweet maple syrup. The maple is more pronounced on the tast and the barrel notes follow. Honestly could have just smelled the beer all night, simply intoxicating. Glad I got the pleasure and treat to try this from the most generous beer buddy.",0.6288903837481336,5.0,0.9913
Sip Of Sunshine,"Disappointing. Maybe my palate has changed, but I think that mass producing at Two roads has diminished this once great IPA (I have been drinking it since 2013 and my first experience was the bombers). The consistency has been spotty at best over the last year and a half; some batches are good and some are shite (the latest one was shite). Heading to the new brewery next month so I am looking forward to trying some Lawson's actually brewed by Lawson. L=4.0 S=4.25 T=3.25 F=4.0 O=3.75 Score=3.67  ***Edited 8/24/19*** Can dated 8/16/19.  Pours a golden color with minimal haze. An aggressive pour leaves a nice two fingers of head that dissipates to a very thin head which leaves a good lacing after every drink, but the lacing is not sticky enough to coat the glass and recedes as the glass is emptied.  The nose is grapefruit pith, pine, with a noticeable malt prescence. Also some light floral notes.  Taste follows the nose with grapefruit and pine dominating the front end, but balanced by the malt mid palette and finishing with a good piney note and a hint of floral both lending a medium to low bitterness.  Medium body with light carbonation that tracks towards an oily mouthfeel.  Five years ago I would have rated this world class. Definately would've been a 4.5+ and I believe it once was but mass production at two roads has diminished this once great beer. A small price to pay for financing the new brewery. In other words, I see what they did there: Lawson's leveraged the hype to finance a sustainable brewry that is true to their roots without sacrificing their independence. If you want to get a hint of the goodness that was sip in the bombers I suggest going to the brewery and getting some double sunshine which is truly a world class beer.",0.6546716915550201,4.25,0.9913
Black Tuesday,"Black Tuesday pours, well, black, with a thin and wispy beige head that recedes to a faint ring around the edge of the glass. Thick, vinous legs on this one, too. The aromas are intense: heavy, heavy alcohol presence that's a lot like straight bourbon (though the alcohol aroma settled substantially as the beer warmed up); dark red fruit like raisins and cherries; chocolate; and a very nice oaky vanilla. Flavors are a dream: sweet, booze-drenched chocolate; spicy alcohol heat; caramelized brown sugar; vanilla marshmallows; more vanilla and molasses; more of those dark red fruits; and a faint char or roastiness on the finish. There's almost a sherry- or port-like flavor to Black Tuesday, which transforms this beer into one fit not only for mortals, but also for the gods. Mouthfeel is not thin, but not as viscous as I was expecting. It's just smooth, substantial, and exactly right for what's going on with the flavors. There's definitely a bit of alcohol burn, but this seemed to dissipate as the beer warmed up.  Overall, Black Tuesday is one of the best straight BA stouts I've ever had, maybe slightly ahead of BCBS and slightly behind the king of the roost, Parabola. The flavors are rich, complex, and hard to capture adequately with words. If you're a BA stout fan, you'll love this one.",0.6702298087946332,4.5,0.9913
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"2016 vintage  A: Pitch-black pour with a huge and dense brown head. It reminds me of a nitro stout really. Head retention is excellent but little to no lacing.   S: A bit nutty and then plenty of vegetal pepper. Sweet vanilla and cinnamon gives it almost a rumchata like aroma at points.   T: Smooth silky caramel from the bourbon right up front. Hints of toffee. Thin chocolate and a bunch of chili peppers. Sweet chili pepper flesh and then a NICE burst of heat towards the finish, especially when combined with that cinnamon. Heat simmers into the finish with that backing of dark chocolate and a bit of oaky vanilla.   M: Heavy, thick, smooth.  O: Stupid good beer. Amazing mixture of bourbon barrels, bitter chocolate, sweet vanilla and heat. All this on top of an already amazing stout base. Great balance of big bold flavors. Pretty much nothing stands out as a negative for me. Excellent brew.",0.6766308290821537,4.75,0.9913
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"L: Dinosaur blood with a chocolate milk head. Ultra thick lacing with great legs like T-Swizzle.   S: Coffee, chocolate, maple, and whiskey (nothing new here, just basically copying and pasting what everyone else says). Once you pop the waxed top, the smell of good old fashioned Walmart-style American breakfast wafts throughout the room, lingering for hours to remind you of its greatness, cancelling out all other scents in the air like a heavenly beer Febreze.   T: Imagine a chewy, whiskey-dipped brownie corner -chased with a shot of maple syrup infused roasted coffee- that assaults your palate with a heavy, sugary sweetness that brings you back to the warm and blissful memories of childhood. This is Mornin' Delight elevated to god-tier status with the help from a little time spent in whiskey barrels. The result is sinfully divine.   M: Viscous and unctuous with the perfect amount of carbonation; this the beer that Untappd cicerones dream of when they discuss the term ""mouthfeel."" This beer sticks to your membranes like Grandma's classic biscuits and gravy. It is magical. It makes you not want to brush your teeth at night.  O: This is one of the best beers on the planet. However, I expected a life-altering craft beer experience when I opened my hand numbered bottle of Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout (note: a bottle that was hand-handed to me by Mike at Toppling Goliath), and all I got in return was an amazingly good beer and a fantastic evening together with family. Overall, it was a terrific occasion and a memorable event, but not one that stands out in my mind as one of the greatest moments of my existence.   I drank a $1,200 bottle of beer hoping to redefine the culinary dreams of my adulthood and came out on the other side realizing that it was ""just beer."" I am now ready to retire from the world of craft beer.",0.6073233868309357,4.75,0.9913
Green,"Yellow with a sort of brown tinge, completely solidly cloudy with no visible carbonation. Topped with 3 fingers of white head, tinged with the same colour as the body.  Smells of citrus, pineapple and green leaves, a slightly fishy smell like some varieties of hops have, and fresh boiling wart, a sort of cut oat smell. Citrus like orange juice as well.  Ok, what just happened to my mouth. This is a different beast than I've had before, but I see the correlation to other similar ones, including Congress St. There's a fair sweetness, with fruity lemon candy and orange juice, but big green leave hops and a hint of diesel but not much. The bitterness is like that of orange juice.  Medium body, moderately low carbonation. Very smooth mouth feel for the ABV. Velvety and soft, but leaves a slightly tannic and resinous coating on the tongue as well. Fresh hops from the bag through and through.  Got this today, January 3rd, 2018, at Tree House Brewing Company in Massachusetts. Enjoying it tonight in Syracuse, NY. Excellent brew, nothing bad to say about it. Freshly canned yesterday, fresh as can be. Dream of a lifetime fulfilled!",0.6577433996273739,4.25,0.9913
Society & Solitude #4,"Finally able to track this thing down and had massive expectations.. double citra (when fresh) is one of my all time favorite beers that I've ever had the pleasure to sip on so when they describe this and double citra meets double galaxy - you know it's gonna be an instant favorite. ""when fresh"" as mentioned above is important as I live in New Mexico and have only ever been able to try HF hops through the means of trading and I very rarely am able to try them within the recommended drink by date that HF prints on their tags. I had an incredible pour of double citra the first time I got to it, the next was from a growler that had a marked ""drink by"" date from a 8 days prior (so probably 13 day old growler by that time)... and was really bad. So in my experience, the hoppy beers in growlers from HF fall off extremely fast.... that said, if you are lucky enough to enjoy any of their hoppy beers within the recommended time, I envy you. HF is the best in my opinion. Rant over, now lets drink: January 16th, 2017 - shipper didn't want to send out until a tuesday because of low temps in the NE - which I completely understand, but this meant I wouldn't receive the ground shipping until 6 days later and after a weekend. Recommended drink by date on this tag was Jan 13th L - light golden hazy look with a frothy top and sticky lacing showing the 8% abv S - there is it, the fresh hopped grapefruit and papaya, the danky galaxy is dominant but the tropical citra is seducing as always. T - delicate candied orange and grapefruit, danky resin and a lite bread backbone, this is great. F - super soft, without already knowing this was an Imperial IPA I would have probably guessed at an abv closer to 6%, its way too crushable. O - and outstanding offering from HF and one that I will absolutely seek out once again, I can only imagine that this may be slightly better when enjoyed from the tap, instead of 9 days removed from the pour date.",0.5685684681989637,4.75,0.9913

Earthy, citrus.  4.5MF. One of best I’ve tasted in an IPA. Sticky, smooth. A pleasure to drink.  4.25 Taste. I was expecting tropical fruit. I didn’t taste any tropical fruit, but the grapefruit citrus rind is excellent.  Overall: excellent approach to an IPA. Wonderful hoppy Character. The blend of flavors, earthy, grapefruit grind, with a big hop character creates an excellent beer.",0.7137178395669238,4.25,0.9913
Sang Noir,"Pours a fizzy ruby-cola color with no head retention into a Barrelworks Teku glass. This beer is the 2014 project, consumed on 4/18/2017.  Aroma is an intense concentration of lactic acid, funk, shoe leather, and rubber. Very acidic smelling. I couldn’t say specifically that I get cherries, but a pleasant tart berry character does come into the aroma. It is masked by the intense funk, which is to be expected after two years barrel aging and three years bottle conditioning. I do get a touch of oak and a bourbon-like sweetness that transitions into a bit of alcohol on the finish.   Taste is a delicious and forward sour. High levels of lactic acid, but the sourness is not so extreme it ruins the beer. The sourness is akin to that of pure lemon juice; it dries the mouth out. Red wine and oak notes are more prevalent than the bourbon in regards to the barrel character as the beer warms. Bourbon is more identifiable when the beer is a bit chilled. More of the leather and rubber character. Tart cherries and sour raspberries are identifiable in the fruited spectrum. Mid-sip a sweetness does emerge, which could be the Bing cherries or perhaps the bourbon. Truthfully, each sip is unique.   Colder, the beer has many flavor profiles that remind me of Russian River consecration but with a more intense flavor and more bourbon influence. However, as the beer warms, it transitions into something totally different, making it hard to review. I must address price. This beer is expensive (33$), so I must review it as such. I think the beer is overpriced by about 10$; I value it in the low 20 dollar range. I understand the time and cost associated, but this is just my opinion on overall value. It is an excellent sour without a doubt. This beer should be paired with food due to its potency. However, the food should be an accompaniment not something that overshadows the beer. A simple pan seared filet or even oven roasted pork chop would work excellent. It gets a 93/100.",0.6784208774584815,4.5,0.9913
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"750ml bottled in October of 2008 continously poured into two tulips, dregs dumped into a taster.  Ruby red, upon pouring some head is stirred up but it quickly dissipates into a ring of foam around the edges of the glass. Clear body with some bubbles dancing to the top. Nothing out of the ordinary here.  Funk and tart cherries upon your first whiff of the beer. Funk with all that barnyardy goodness and a little bit of a medicinal quality to it. Some gym sock and a faint bit of lactic funk in there too as it begins to warm. Agitation brings out more tart cherries with a subdued funk and more medicinal scents.  Pleasantly tart cherries greet your palate with a much softer funk than the nose. Actually, the taste here is much more abrasively sour and fruity than the smell. Hints of the funk upon swallow and some what muddled throughout but the taste here is all about the cherries.  Sticky sweet on the palate with low carbonation. More sticky than most other krieks.  Sharp tart cherries with a good funk. A pretty solid example of the style, and to be honest I am surprised how well the fruit has held up in this one. This was the last bottle on the shelf at one of my favorite shops in town so I had to grab it seeing as proper lambic is becoming a scarce commodity in this country.",0.6527847432671221,4.0,0.9912
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"On tap @ the Three Floyds brewpub on 4/25/09 during DLD. Served in a snifter.   Pours as black as an oil slick into the glass with a burnt and charred mocha colored tan head. Standard D look for this, except that the head looks a tad thin and more foamy than the regular Dark Lord. The aroma is just thick with bourbon warmth and pervasive accents of wood and vanilla that lie on top of the RIS notes of chocolate, coffee, molasses, and dark fruit tang, giving an extra level of hugeness to this bouqet. Wow, this is big in the nose!   The taste starts with massive barrel notes of boozy bourbon and oaky accents that is more than an equal for the massive sweetness and roast of the Dark Lord. The bourbon never seems to get overpowering to me because the original flavor profile was so huge to begin with. Finishes with a tangy, boozy, and dry feel that warms the palate and sticks in the mouth. The mouthfeel is hugely chewy and viscous with most of the heat from the beer appearing to come more from the bourbon notes and less from the ABV of the body itself. A warming, steady sipper here.   Well there's certainly nothing understated about this beer. Bourbon-aged Dark Lord is what you want and bourbon-aged Dark Lord is what you GET! Luckily I greatly enjoy both and found a good balance between the two aspects, despite just the overall mammoth flavors and strength going on here. I greatly enjoyed this.",0.6642049599875237,4.5,0.9912
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Popped this total badboy at 1 of my retirement parties, and shared it with 8 friends and family;the taste floored everyone.  Aroma was strong, but ""typical Dark Lord "".  Appearance very black with just a tip of dark tan around the edge, not too much foam, drops away fast.  mouthfeel is VERY typically Dark Lord, sweet, thick, deliciously so.  Taste - OMG - so frickin' good, wow ! we also had Rare, Choco Rain and others, this stood way taller than the rest, totally my favorite right now. Sweet, coats your mouth with delicious vanilla, cherry and bourbon flavors, not at all hot after sitting for almost a year.  If I can trade for more, I won't think twice about trading away most anything for more of this monsterously flavorful beast.",0.6126220470353342,5.0,0.9912
Aaron,"500ml bottle, batch 2, 2016. Served in a snifter glass. Pours a darker caramel brown body, one finger offwhite head, great retention, little bits of sugary bits on the lacing. Smell is rich caramel and molasses, touch of honey, earth, whiskey and oak. It's really remniscent of Straight Jacket; the sweet but not too sweet malt is in full display in your cribriform plates. Flavour is similarly a wonderful complexity of malt flavours; in some ways you realize that malt can add a lot of complexity on its own if you do it right. Chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, earth, whiskey, touch of smoke, oak, molasses, even a bit of dryness to it, like at the backend of a good bourbon. No heat. Mouthfeel is fuller bodied, appropriately carbonated, supremely drinkable but with a nice slight burn on the backend. This is one of the better barleywines I've had; I'm not a huge barleywine fan but I do really enjoy certain ones such as Straight Jacket and this is right in that vein.",0.6882068490784211,4.5,0.9912
Black Tuesday,"Serving: 1 Pt. 9.4 Fl. oz. bottle poured into a Founder's CBS snifter. Bottled on 8/25/15, making this just under 6 months old.   A: Pours a surprisingly light brown color. Would've figured this to be classic motor oil-like, but no. Slim off-brown color head. Kind of murky.  S: Boom. Probably the most bourbon or spirit-forward beer I've got a nose on. Huge bourbon up front, great vanilla and chocolate notes, caramel, almond and dark fruits tucked in there as well.  T: Holy crap. Flavor overload here. Huge bourbon up front again, followed by that chocolate, vanilla, coconut, almond, caramel. Small notes of dark fruits on the finish as well, with some raspberry and dark cherry.  M: Just an assault on the palate. Much like a really good DIPA will hit you with hops for days, this thing is boozy as a mother. 19.9% is no joke here, you get all of it.   O: Wow, way to make a first impression. I love when a beer really has something to say. This may not be my #1 all-time favorite, but I really have respect for a BA Imperial Stout that steps up and is different. This guy wants to be 19.9% and is definitely 19.9%. The booze may be overwhelming for some, but it really lets the flavors shine and magnifies everything x10. I never had OG Rare, but this is what I envision it to be like because this truly is BCBS on steroids.  Recommendation: This was a long time chase for me and I gave up a lot for it. You should too.",0.6097012609075869,4.75,0.9911
Enjoy By IPA,"Enjoying the Enjoy By 07/04/2016! Actually...enjoy sounds like an understatement. This IPA is fabulous!! Pours a brilliant bronze and orange color. Nice thumbnail foam head. The lacing is ever present and semi sticky. An attractive drink for sure. The aroma covers the spectrum of fruity flavors with a constant undertone of biscuity malt. Mangoe, pineapple and all sorts of tropical goodness hit the nose. Midway, the citrusy tones( I'm thinking grapefruit pith) provide some zest. The resiny hop oils add some pungency. The tropical and citrusy fruit are most noticeable the first half of the drink. Also, the caramel malt backbone is present. Although there is lots of sweetness, the prevalence of hops truly takes over halfway. Citrusy hops, sharp pine needles, resin, herbal aftertaste. Overall, this is a big juicy and hoppy IPA, however, there is some dryness that keeps you wanting more. The body is medium, smooth, the carbonation is soft. So drinkable it's scary! Truly delicious! One of the best! World class!",0.7155329411246619,4.75,0.9911
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Special filled hand bottle from an un-named source creating a raving mystery much like the Dark Lord itself... Appears a dark black with a small tan head that fades into a a gentle tan collar. Smell is of rich maple sweet vanilla, dark chocolate, bourbon, oak, fresh brownie batter, and raisins. Mouthfeel is heavy on the palate, warming, sweet, raisiny, and sticky with a mildly rich burn in the swallow. Drinkability is pretty good on this despite the instant warming bourbon burn that makes it pretty intense with an alcohol presence. Nice!",0.6690418905586702,4.0,0.9911
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Poured into a tulip. This is my official ""end of first year of med school celebrating beer."" 2007 vintage, bottled 12/27/2007 and given a 10 year lifespan.   5.0 A: Mildly hazed light orange color. Three fingers of frothy white head. Retention is very good and thick, glass covering lacing is left behind.  4.5 S: Really nice nose on this as well. The funk is amazing. This might be the most powerful and complex funk I've ever encountered. Tons of hay and horse. Decaying fruit, stinky sweaty feet, apple orchard, dry rotted sweat socks, old wood. Like most other 3F gueuzes, this is insanely complex with the funk, but not all that sour. Nearly no acetic acid and only mild amounts of lactic acid. Borderline 5.0.  4.0 T: Taste is good, but it's not as complex or as overall good as the nose. There's more sourness, but it's a strange dry sourness, which is something I've never experienced before. Other than that, the funk is still crazy strong, but not quite as complex. Lots of hay, dry earthy woodiness, dry rotted sweat socks, musty basement. Lightly horsey. Mild lemony fruitiness.  3.5 M: Lighter body. Good spritzy gueuzy carbonation. Could use more creaminess though.  4.0 D: This is good and I appreciate the funk, but it's a tad bit disappointing, especially given how impressive the nose is. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great gueuze, but I expect a lot from 3F when it comes to them.",0.6791777781531746,4.0,0.9911
Haze,"Another outstanding NE-style IPA from this rockstar brewery. I thoroughly enjoyed this one, even though my expectations were sky high. Juicy, flavorful, creamy, well-hidden ABV and light body. Just an amazing beer. Fairly fresh, too - canned on 5/14/19. Pours a very nice hazy yellow color with lots of fluffy white head and good-looking sheets of lingering lacing that lasted for quite some time. I would have given it higher marks if the lacing or head were more impressive, but the haze looked quite good. Smells of juicy fruit - orange, tangerine, pineapple, passion fruit, grapefruit, lemon. Maybe a little mango in there. I didn't quite detect the peach. A good hit of malt, vanilla and a little caramel as well. The trailing off aromas at the end were a nice floral bouquet. The taste follows the nose, and the juiciness and depth of flavor of this beer was just so impressive. The mouthfeel was just to die for - creamy, slightly sticky, full, smooth and that high ABV was so incredibly well-hidden. Drank and felt like a regular IPA, not an imperial one. Just the right amount of carbonation. This paired well with savory dinner and even better with sweet dessert. I'm looking forward to sampling the Julius can that I own, likely tomorrow or the day after!",0.6960658948415416,4.5,0.9911
Coconut B-Bomb,"2018 bottle poured into a tulip at 55°F.  L: Pours a very dark brown with deep brown head. Low head retention, but it's certainly present immediately after pouring.  S: Bourbon with a bit of the alcohol, coconut, vanilla.  T: Lots of coconut, with chocolate and vanilla. Bourbon on the finish. Sweet beer but not to the level that it affects drinkability. The balance here is unbelievable.  F: Medium-full body and medium carbonation. Very smooth and creamy. A bit of alcoholic warming on the end, but far less than you would expect from a 14% beer.  O: I will admit, I don't like coconut. I usually find the flavor to be overpowering. That said, Fremont somehow manages to make a coconut beer where the coconut flavor is indeed front and center but I absolutely love it. Credit to the absolute beautiful balance of this beer. It didn't lose anything that made the original B-Bomb great. Great bourbon flavor, complex, hides the 14% really well, yet still lets the coconut take center stage and shine.",0.6566815565818168,4.75,0.991
Nelson,"L - pale yellow color, hazy, 1 finger thick sudsy white head that reduces into a the ring. Minimal lacing  S - smell is somewhat subdued but very pleasant. Biscuit, orange and grapefruit present with a dank hoppy background   T - grapefruit and orange come through amazingly well with a nice touch of biscuit, the hops really come trough this beer perfectly adding a dank, piney aspect that really goes great with the citrus. true to smell.

Schaerbeekse Kriek,Bottle date of 4/25/11 poured into a Drie Fonteinen tumbler. This brew pours a hazed color of deep beet red. About a finger of bright pink head forms across the top and slowly fades leaving some spots of lace clinging to the glass. The bubbles pop and fizz across the top and collect around the edge of the glass. A light swirl revives some bubble formation back to the surface.  The aroma of this brew has that classic Drie Fonteinen funk with lots of earthy tones and a bit of herbal aspect mixed with stinky cheese and diaper. Some pitted to rotten/over-ripen cherry character mixes with light notes of plastic and vinegar. Wet leather runs rapid throughout this brew with a little bit of mildew and old cork character.  The taste mirrors the aroma pretty much flawlessly but with more intense cherry character. The funky flavors of earth and wet leather are the first things noted with a slightly acidic note. Cherry flavoring runs throughout with a taste of pits and very mild oak to vanilla flavoring with a very light spiced touch of something almost like cinnamon. The cherries provide an added depth to the sour character of this brew and a pleasantly mild contrasting sweetness that is very natural tasting. Throughout the entire experience this brew never once came across being medicinal like some kriek's do.  This is a medium to light bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. I wanted to tackle this offering with as fresh a bottle as possible to see how much fruited flavor was in one of these before it fades and the funk overtakes it. I was not disappointed in the least. I really enjoyed the natural flavoring of this brew and it was very easy drinking. At no point did I pick up on the 5% alcohol that was listed on the bottle.,0.6731209721542838,4.5,0.991
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"2016 out of an Assassin Teku.   Look: Dark, Thick, Oily. Thin head but had that nice espresso color to it.   Smell: Rich maple the moment I cracked the the bottle. Once it was in the glass you could get a bit of the coffee/mocha flavor too it.   Taste: Amazing balance of Maple, Coffee, stout. It was a complex journey of flavor. The barrel was really subtle, which I think is something that really makes this shine as a beer. The coffee wasn't a major flavor but maybe a bit over-roasted.  Feel: Rich, Syrupy goodness.   Overall: Truly a delightful beer that I feel lucky to drink. I can see why it is so hyped and the skill that went into brewing it.",0.6712532056768551,5.0,0.9909
Chocolate Rain,"Bottle at NWI Tasting group Black Tuesday 09-12 and Variants tasting  A - Chocolate brown with a thin looking body. There was a very small chocolate head that faded quickly  S - Milk and dark chocolate, light vanilla, caramel and bourbon. Not as boozy in the nose as Grey Monday  T - This is a delicious beer. There is sweet vanilla, light oak, caramel, sweet bourbon. This sweetness is balanced perfectly with the bitterness of the dark chocolate cacao nibs. Finish has slight cinnamon spice, heat from the bourbon and light oak  MF - This is a super thick and velvety smooth beer. It is really thick and coats the tongue. The finish is slightly astringent   O - This is really a good beer that I liked more than BT and Grey Monday. It has such a great flavor profile that is balanced between the dark chocolate and the sweetness of BT. Plus, it was super creamy and smooth when drinking. This one was definitely worth the hype",0.6469731591701329,4.5,0.9909
Swish,The beer pours nicely with a bright yellow custard color and white head. The head dissipates quickly with very little lacing.  The smell is heavenly like you just stepped into a citrus grove. There's strong notes of orange juice and lemon zest with hints of grass honey and crystal malt and a subtle pininess.  The flavor is spot on for an IPA with a perfect balance of citrus and bittering hops. Its rounded out by a great grain bill. The malt compliments the hops with caramel and biscuit flavors that follow the hops.  The mouthful had a great balance of body and carbonation. The beer is medium bodied with a smooth initial mouthful followed by just the right CO2 bite.  Overall this has been one of the best NE style IPAs that I've had to date. I would recommend this beer to any IPA lover who has a chance to get it.,0.6910390816689073,4.75,0.9909
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"First and foremost a big thanks to roon for sending me this bottle via his LIF.  12oz Bottle poured into a Bourbon County snifter. Poured along-side a 2012 Barrel Aged Dark Horse Plead the 5th and a 2013 KBS as part of a side-by-side tasting.  Appearance: Dark, reddish, brown almost black with a small 1/4"" head bubbling up. The head recedes to a thin cap but leaves a heavy, frothy, tan ring. This beer looks viscous and leaves some very nice sticky lacing.  Smell: Sweet maple front and center, I've never had this much maple in an beer I've smelled, it towers over both the bourbon and chocolate that you can sense underneath. Amazing nose on this beer.  Taste: There are a lot of flavors to pick out of this one with oak, vanilla, whiskey, chocolate, and coffee standing out and having each element wrapped in a blanket of maple. As the beer warms the flavor deepens but never loses balance, all of the flavors continue to stand out. There is a sweetness to this beer (with this much maple flavor it would be impossible for it not to have sweetness) but it is never overwhelming, it never verges on becoming ""too much"". I can't imagine a better tasting stout.  Mouthfeel: Silky smooth and although sweet it never becomes cloying.  Overall: I am a fan of maple flavor in a stout; therefore, this was the best barrel aged stout I have had to date. Left me wanting nothing but more.",0.6412140797547351,4.75,0.9909
Green,"Look- I've been told many beers look like orange juice. I've seen some that have those characteristics. This really looks like OJ  Smell- Flowery notes. Very pungent and earthy. Has slight hints of citric and tropical. Slight hints of pineapple, orange, and mango  Taste- complex. Flowery notes with hints of tropical citra. Earthiness is great in this beer. Really nice bite and peppery finish. May be the most interesting I've ever tasted  Feel- treehouse all the way.   Overall- Wow. It's crushable but great as a sipper. The flavor complexities are all over the place and hit everywhere. Smells great. Feel is great . Looks great. Just impressive",0.6828835709611272,4.75,0.9909
Sip Of Sunshine,"16oz can courtesy of beerloserLI and his mostly aluminum assault upon my porch (and my liver). Canned on March 7, 2018, per the stamp on the can's bottom. Apparently contract brewed by Two Roads Brewing in Stratford, Connecticut.  Poured into a pseudo-IPA glass, this was a slightly chill-hazed coppery amber, with a nice, thick and creamy off-white head that left lots of lace.  Citrusy hop nose, more grapefruit than anything else, which surprised me. More tangy and bitter than sweet. Also some piney notes, but with a little bit of honey-like sweetness to balance.  Taste is pretty much like in the nose. Tastes like an old school IPA (which I generally prefer) rather than the beer Orange Julius approach favored by so many NE IPA brewers these days. Just enough malt to balance, while the piney, astringentness is held a little more in check than the brashest of west coast IPAs.  Medium bodied, with a resiny, oily mouthfeel.  Apparently not all NE IPAs are easy drinking, citrus sodas with beer, low IBU softies. I'm not implacably against the modern NE IPA style, but I still prefer my IPAs in the more traditional manner, so I loved this, and am glad I've got another can of this. Thanks, Brian!",0.6498042951002441,4.25,0.9909
Chocolate Rain,"Well I guess its time for the 3rd perfect score. We're almost up to 1900 reviews, might as well break this one out. I've had this at least a dozen times now, for good reason. I love it.   Pours substantially brown and black, perhaps less black than black tuesday because of the heavy amount of chocolate addition to it. The forced carbonation does wonders as it always has at least a full inch of brown head on the top of it. Poured into tulip glasses while in the oversized jacuzzi tub or hot tub outdoors, this one proudly has a 100% score rating with the ladies afterwards.  Well you can't get a bigger chocolate aroma than this . Rogue Double Chocolate, Southern Tier Choklat, they come close. But this gets even better as the bourbon, vanilla, oak and sugar round out the chocolate experience.  Wow, its a warm one, definitely you feel the warmth as it slides down the throat, but there is no burn, so much sweetness and chocolate that it prevents that. Sticky mouthfeel and cling, the bourbon and chocolate never fade, never relent.   Even the vanilla won't take a back seat on this. I guess the oak kind of does, being that everything else is more substantial, but dont downplay the oak, it has a good rounding quality for everything else.   If your lady loves chocolate, you owe it to her and your dick to pop a bottle of this when its just you two (or three if she's cool and brings a friend). YMMV.",0.5872274845242031,5.0,0.9908
Beatification,"375ml bottle, 6,0% Abv.  Served lightly chilled in an over sized wine glass.  Batch 5 Bottled on: 01/10/2012  Thanks to Futura123 for hooking me up with this bottle.   Appearance: Beatification pours a lightly hazed golden orange and is topped by a good sized white head. The head displays good retention for a sour and leaves a few small patches of lace clinging to the glass as it recedes.   Smell: The nose is dominated by fruity notes, including: lemon, orange peel, white grapes, tangerine, under ripe stone fruit (apricots) and even a hint of under ripe granadilla, Beatification is not the funkiest beer around, but it is certainly not forgotten. There is a distinct musty character as well as notes of old dusty sacks, old wood, old dry grass, a good dose of oak and a very light earthy note.   Taste: I have been told that Beatification is one of the more sour beers around, but I am not sure I expected it to be quite this sour - that said, I love sour so this is right up my street! After the big mouth-puckering sourness, flavour notes include: Tart citrus fruits (lemon and a little orange), green apple peel, tart white grapes, a little apricot, cider vinegar, a touch of white wine, oak, musty notes, old wood, some earthiness, a little leather and surprisingly a hint of horse.   Mouthfeel: In almost all the -ation beers I have had from Russian River, Vinnie has nailed the mouthfeel and this is no exception. Medium bodied (high for the style), with a medium-high level of wonderfully smooth carbonation.   Overall: Beatification is a fantastic geuze (yes, I consider this a geuze, not an American wild ale) and is one of the few American sours that I think will stand up well to its Belgian counterparts. I would love to see how this one develops over time.",0.6548627299240155,4.5,0.9908
Space Trace,"Split with JLindros.  A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice dark black hue with a thin mocha head that fades to leave light wisps. Really nice legs.  S - Big aromas of chocolate galore, real nice coconut, roasted coconut meat and flakes, nice bourbon juice as well, light barrels.  T - Taste is similar to the nose with huge bourbon notes, rich barrel as well, nice oak. Great coconut, almost chunky, the chocolate is nice.  M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, rather oily, not that creamy either.  O - Overall this was a very solid stout with a nice bourbon notes. The coconut was nice, however, rather chunky in the glass.  Serving Type: bottle",0.6510947270396179,4.5,0.9908
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"Prepping for a wedding, hopefully this is a good luck charm.  A- Tallboy pours into a tall chalice with a black as the midnight sky body and a very, very dark cocoa powder hue to the cap. The crown shoots up to an inch high with very good retention and a thick, frothy-foamy texture. Thick coral-esque webs of lacing.  S- Cocoa, cocoa, cocoa. Rich, bitter and semi-sweet chocolate dominates the aroma alongside some of the other roasty things like the charred barley and some dark roast coffee beans. Chocolate syrup, sweet milk chocolate bars, fudge, slight dark fruits, milk and cookies, fruity very dark chocolate and a hint of toasted nuts.  T- The sweetness makes a bit of a difference here as things shift more towards a rich, semi-dark milk chocolate bar type of flavor alongside that chocolate syrup and less of the bitter dark chocolate bars and baking cocoa. Rather sweet but still balanced by the coffee, chocolate and roast malt bitterness. Toffee, caramel, chocolate milk, malted milk balls, roast barley, chocolate malt, toasted nuts, fudge, chocolate truffles and cookies come to mind. Extremely rich for the ABV.  MF- Again and again Tree House dominates mouthfeel. Thick, luscious and heavy with a high level of carbonation that creams up beautifully on the palate. A touch bitter in the finish but a lot of sweetness to counteract that.  There is actually a fairly strong amount of coffee in the flavor but wow does the cocoa shine in this beer. It is about as far as you can take chocolate in a beer before it becomes too much with wonderful sweet milk chocolate, fudge, fruity dark chocolate and cocoa nib flavors. A 6.5% dessert that packs about as much flavor as it possibly could.",0.6394893631877563,4.5,0.9908
Beatification,"Thanks beerzebub, Jonathan, for bringing this beer that I should have tasted long ago. Batch 5.  The beer pours a nice straw yellow colored body with not much head other than a bone white ring.   The smell and taste have a beautiful elegant sourness that has a really nice roundness to it somehow as well. A mix of lighter fruits like white grape, apricot, pear. Really beautiful taste, almost like a fine chapagne with a big wild yeast note, really nice.   Effervescent and bubbly feel, very elegant once again. This is so balanced and great.  Awesome stuff.",0.6707660859173045,4.5,0.9908

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Poured fro m a 12oz. bottle into a snifter. Bottled 5/4/2016  L- Pours a thick dark chocolate brown, pretty much black only slight amount of light coming through on the edge when tilted, small medium brown head.   S- Cherry, dates, fig, licorice, dark chocolate, vanilla, coconut, some oak, some alcohol but not burning. Touch of smoke too.   T- Similar to aroma, big dark fruit and chocolate with a good amount of bourbon flavors that don't overshadow the beer, the alcohol is more noticeable on the palate with some warming but not distracting, finishes with chocolate and a pretty high amount of hops for a barrel aged imperial stout.   F- Full, oily mouthfeel, carbed to style.   O- A very nice treat to get this in bottles at the General Store, has all the big flavors that put it up there with the likes of BCBS. While the hops are a little higher than I prefer in a stout, in about a year or two it should be smoothed out and drinking fantastic. This one is a bit bigger than Black Note but both are excellent beers.",0.6509794146646666,4.75,0.9908

Oude Geuze Vintage,"A - Golden, brassy orange color with an average sized, foamy, and bubbly white head with a bit below average retention and a thin bubbly lace left.  S - Well balanced hay/barnyard/funk along with some lemon citrus and apple. Has a good juicy aroma along with a touch of a tart and acidic aroma. Perfect balance between the aroma, my mouth is watering and it is very enticing.  T - Similar to the nose. Some funk and tartness with just a hint of sour taste. A lot of fruitiness with some apple and lemon being strongest. Hints of other golden and tropical fruit as well as some earthiness. Some hay and mustiness and a touch of lemongrass. Very well balanced sour.  M - Medium body with a healthy amount of carbonation. Fairly smooth with a drying finish and just the very slightest bit of puckering.  D - Well balanced and not overly sour/tart but has a nice balance.  Notes: Bottled 02/10/2005. A wonderful gueuze that is very well balanced with the tart/sour/funky flavor and a juicy fruitiness.

Swish,"Just to say beforehand, This was the first beer release that I attended in Out of state, or even im Maine. It was about a 2 hour drive, 3 hour wait in line, and a 2 hour drive back home. But very much worth it.  A: This beer is a pure yellow color, the color of a lemon. It pours with a nice head and leaves plenty of residue when it settles down.   S: Has a very lemony smell, orange / citrus are also present.   T: I first time I tasted this beer it was the smoothest beer that I have ever had. The fact that it is a double IPS is astonishing. There is such a strong citrusy taste that is good every single sip of the beer. It’s a true juice punch.  F: Goes down smooth and has a nice hoppy warmth that stays in the back of your mouth for a while.   O: Overall this is definitely one of my favorite beers. Take the trip up to Maine, drink it Fresh, and enjoy. If you can’t get up to Maine, then trade for it 100%, you will not be disappointed.",0.6246637866050017,5.0,0.9907
Beatification,"Huge thanks to nate8767 for shipping me my very first of a long time want.  Pours bright gold with a finger of white creamy head. Excellent lacing and retention.  Smells as much like a gueuze as any stateside sours I've had. Tart lemon and citrus with an underlying deep funk. Magnificent.  Flavors are similar. Lots of tart lemon and grass up front. Sourness really takes hold after that. Very light delicate flavors still stand out among the sour. Finishes musty and dry.  Creamy mouthfeel with good prickly carbonation.  I'm not sure it's the best sour I've ever had, but it's definitely a great one and something unlike most American Wild Ales. Perfect sourness level. The underlying components still shine through and create a great experience. Very excited to have a few more to age.",0.7098538567323837,4.5,0.9907

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"The first of three Cantillon bottles, all of which showed some degree of rusting on the inner cap, but proved to be fine. This vintage was from 2005.  Pours a medium pink with a wispy white head that eventually dies to nothing. A few spots here and there, but otherwise a fairly standard lambic appearance. The nose is bizzare - balsamic vinegar, sulphur, malt vinegar, horseblanket, earth and oak. Really big for a lambic, and really sharp.  Huge sour flavour, with a barrel-load of vinegar, lemon, oak, funk in the extreme... tastes like bug heaven. Once all this dies down the raspberry starts to assert itself in a slick, slightly sticky tooth-coating fruity sweetness. Not to say that for any stretch of the imagination is this beer sweet, as a big sour finish reminds you what's really going on, but it is nice to have that added, brief sugary complexity. Other than the passing slickness the body is light and refreshing in its tartness.  This is a nicely done, complex lambic. Its not my favourite on the basis that some of the flavours simply don't jive so well with me, and at times it almost comes across as harsh. That said, a good experience, and another winner from Cantillon!",0.6830909169517261,4.0,0.9907
Swish,"Canned a week ago, it's got a classic New England look: completely cloudy piss yellow color and a foamy 1-2 finger foamy white head that faded very very slowly and left really nice spotty lacing and rings as it went down.  Nose starts off a little odd with a mix of weed and smelly armpit, but then thankfully shifts to fresh juicy citrus hops. We've got a mix here of orange juice, guava, lemon, red grapefruit, pineapple, tart green apple, green pear, dank piney hops, fresh floral hops and a bunch of earthy notes. Really complex, juicy and full of tropical fruit.  Wow, tastes great with so many juicy hop flavors that it's an explosion of fruit and fresh hops. Grapefruit, lemon, orange peel, graham cracker, biscuit, dank piney hops, tangerine, Ritz cracker, caramel, mango, faint brown sugar, earthy notes, light peppery spices and dry floral hops. Perfectly balanced and hides the ABV masterfully, it's incredibly easy to drink. If you're not from the Northeast USA then trade for this beer as it's excellent.",0.655089892660505,5.0,0.9906
Coconut B-Bomb,"On tap at Arch Bridge the other day during their (incredible) Fremont brewing tap takeover.  The beer pours the expected blackish brown color with very good head retention and considerable lacing. The nose is impressive, in a mounds bar kind of way (if you don't like chocolate coconut, you likely won't like this beer). There is considerable dark chocolate and vanilla, but with a good dollop of coconut as well. Also picking up some underlying coffee, but the chocolate, vanilla and coconut really dominate. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, and while this beer is pretty sweet, it wasn't as sweet and boozy as the rusty nail I tried side by side with the coconut Bbomb. This is a full bodied beer of course, and the abv. is certainly up there, but it wasn't the least bit hot, heavy or cloying on the palate. I still can't imagine downing a single bottle at a sitting, but even so, I thought drinkability was pretty decent in this beer.  Very impressive stuff, and yet completely different from any of the previous Bbomb and KDS variants I've had in the past. Well done Fremont Brewing.",0.6595091297092089,4.5,0.9906
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Vintage 2006, bottled 2008.   As soon as the cork is pulled, the aroma of raspberries wafts into the room. Poured into a tulip, has a lovely pinkish garnet color, transparent, clear on the first pour, a little cloudy on the second. A half inch head of light foam, quickly dissipates to a ring. Some motile lacing quickly runs down the glass back into the ring of foam and does not stick.   Nose is fresh raspberry, old wood and spice, a little Cantillon funk, and a mild acetic acid (vinegar) note. Main impression is a glass of macerated raspberries.   This tastes of fresh raspberries upfront with some raspberry juice sweetness, then the acetic acid hits mid palate and continues to get more acidic towards the finish, which is pretty sour at that point. I love the fresh raspberry flavor, even in this 5 year old version.   Body is light with some slight carbonation, flat mouthfeel. Has a clean presentation with no stickiness. Unfortunately, the carbonation leaves too quickly.   This beer preserves the fresh acidity of the raspberry and enhances that some with an extra vinegar sourness--but a little too much. The malt notes are light and the old wood notes, spice, and tannins add some complexity. Definitely a great beer, but the sour level makes me want to have it with food, which it pairs well with. My goal is to try this again as fresh as possible to guage how much of the fruit has left this bottle after cellaring.  Vintage 2008, bottled 29 September, 2010  Update: The following day, I opened the 2008 vintage bottled in 2010. This has a deeper red color and the raspberry flavor is slightly fresher with a much lower acetic acid level that did not produce the wave of acidity I experienced with the 2006 and is better carbonated with a more champagne-like mouthfeel. I could enjoy sipping a whole bottle of this vintage, which is what I am about to do :-). Because the 2008 vintage presents considerably better, I have upgraded my earlier score to an across the board 4.75 (was 4.5 overall). With these beers, one can expect variations by vintage (neither the lambic nor the fruit will be the same) and quality also depends on cellaring time and conditions, but 2008 is delicious now and may be as good as it gets (until I get to try a newer vintage).",0.6792326769078424,4.75,0.9906
Sip Of Sunshine,"Lawson's Finest Liquids ""Sip Of Sunshine"" 1 Pint can, ""PKG 25JUL18 20:16"" and sampled on 05SEP18 $5.99 @ DiCicco & Sons, Brewster, NY  Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a hazy deep gold that borders on becoming orange-ish beneath a two-finger thick head of off-white foam. The head seems to be holding well so I'm going to wait to see how long it takes to settle ... ... ... well, that took a long time, and there's some really nice lacing where the head fell. If I hold it up to the light there's clear particulate in suspension, I'm guessing from dry-hopping. The aroma is citrusy and piney, maybe even a bit earthy, somewhat floral, and there's a hint of some tropical fruit to it as well, maybe some pineapple and mango - I wasn't expecting that. Wait, is that some cattiness in there or is it just hop resins? If it is cattiness it's not enough to bother me and just comes off as pungent. I wasn't expecting that either, for some reason I thought this was more of a ""juice bomb"" beer but it's not. On to the flavor... it's pretty much as the aroma suggests it will be with added golden malt. There's a touch of a honeyish note to it but it's not really sweet. I wonder if they've used some Gambrinus honey malt? The sweetness that is there is nicely balanced by the raspy, earthy, and ""dank"" aspects of the hops, and a solid bitterness. There's some sweet malt in the finish but it erodes steadily allowing the hops and bitterness to step forward. Nicely balanced and rounded. Quite pleasant. Not too strong or bitter, and loaded with hops but not overdone. I should note at this point that although it displayed great head retention and some very nice initial lacing, that lacing just didn't hold up. OK, mouthfeel... medium bodied leaning towards medium-full but not particularly sugary or 'dextrinous'. Crisp, at least at first, with a slightly elevated carbonation but then it gasses off a bit and becomes smoother. Overall, it's pretty impressive, and it opens my eyes a little bit more to what exactly a NE IPA is, even if this is a stronger version, and with that said, as a ""double IPA"" it's one of the most drinkable I've had. It's definitely worth trying, and certainly worth seeking out for fans of the American IPA style. Review# 6,220",0.6934868870771331,4.5,0.9906

Chocolate Rain,"Chocolate Rain, 2013 vintage. Tasted July 5th, 2014.  APPEARANCE  Pours opaque black with tones of deep red. Initially there is almost no head, and the little there is disappears quickly. No lacing.  AROMA  It is baffling how complex the aroma is. At first I'm sucked into a whirlpool of dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and vanilla. Holy cow.  Once I recover, sweet ripe dates as well as red raisin greet my nose. I can also definitely smell the alcohol. There is a hint of wood somewhere in the back, and I perceive sweet bourbon somewhere in the distance. I'm overwhelmed with sweetness, sweetness, and more sweetness. Brown sugar, and sugar pie (a French Canadian specialty: brown sugar, cream, butter).  It doesn't take too long for fortified wine, port wine, madera and sherry to make their presence known, in no uncertain way. They are supported by a malty back bone.  As if it was not sweet enough, other desserts come to me after it warms up: chocolate cake, some sweet carrot cake, notes of cola, truffle, and caramel.  TASTE  It tastes almost as complex as the aroma. My first impression is all dark chocolate and vanilla, with a touch of espresso, truffle, and caramel. It is almost unbearable how good this is.  Sugar pie returns (caramelized cream and brown sugar) - you really have to try this one day to know what I'm talking about. I feel like I'm drinking fancy Swiss chocolate candies. A little note of cinnamon remains after the sip is gone.  I can actually taste the alcohol. However, it doesn't overpowers anything, it balances well with the other components. Eventually I spot a few extras that do their thing quietly in the background: amaretto, a touch of hazelnut, and almond.  Finally, I taste what's going on in the background: tobacco, leather, and a hint of fig.  I was a little surprised to find very little bourbon, wood, molasses and licorice, which are typically found abundantly in this type of beer. I suspect those qualities couldn't find a spotlight on this crowded stage. Btw this is not a flaw, just something unusual. The beer is already outstanding.  MOUTHFEEL  The carbonation is pretty low, and I stand in a world of warmth from the alcohol (not burning though). Curiously, it leaves in my mouth a prickly sensation, that faintly numbs my tongue and even the inside of my cheeks. I suspect the vanilla to be responsible.  I was expecting a very thick and oily beer, but no, surprisingly, its body leans on the light to medium side. Viscosity is average, and it is not very chewy. It is extremely pleasant, to be honest, it elevates the drinkability. Even more surprising, the finish is rather crisp for that style of beer. Perhaps aging it for a year and half has thinned it just right?  OVERALL  Lots of surprises with this beer, especially with the mouth feel. The only flaw I found was the lack of head, which is a fairly minor one. For me this beer is nearly perfect, mature, and -excuse the language- fucking EPIC.",0.6647288656212441,4.0,0.9906
Chocolate Rain,"750ml bottle stored in my cellar for over a year. Poured into 18oz Funky Buddha snifter, bottle split three ways. Reviewed live.  A- Pours a dark black that has some translucency, actually slightly lighter then I was expecting. Pretty much no head, very still top, minimal carbonation, just some alcohol legs along the sides of the glass.  S- Rich chocolate, vanilla beans, lightly bourbon, extremely well balanced booze. Can tell it's got a high abv, but fits very nicely for how high it is and integrates well with the other aromas. Fairly aromatic.  T- This is where the beer gets really interesting: flavors of dark chocolate, cocoa nibs, bourbon, vanilla, hints of booze on this finish but nowhere near what you would expect at almost 20%, extremely well balanced. Aftertaste that lingers with chocolate and balanced vanilla.  M- Very smooth especially for 19.5%, a beer definitely should not be this smooth with an abv this high- feels more like 9%, fairly minimal carbonation but nice for the style. Can't believe how easy this is to drink.  O- This was a fantastic high abv stout that was incredibly easy to drink and extremely flavorful. I was expecting this to be overly boozey but the abv was well hidden and was surprisingly easy to drink with all the flavors coming out very nicely. I highly recommend seeking this out, just be careful with how dangerously smooth it is.",0.7242646532026021,4.5,0.9906

S- On the nose I get sweet orange juice,fresh peaches,papaya,mango,and pineapple fruit notes.Trace elements of bitter pine hops,and bright biscuit malts.This is a very hop forward beer,mostly consisting of tropical fruits.  T- The palate follows the nose with orange juice,papaya,fresh peaches,mango,and pineapple from the beginning till the end.The palate finishes off with slight flavors of bitter pine that lingers with a sweet biscuit malt balance.This is one of those ""juice bomb"" IPA's I have been patiently waiting to try.It did not disappoint,at all.  F- The mouth feel is medium heavy,with a very sticky,yet smooth and silky texture.Low amount of oxidation on the tongue.Smooth on the finish,with just a small hint of dryness.  O- I really don't know where to start with this one.This IPA is mind blowing.It is super juicy on the nose and the palate,with a perfect balance of bitter pine.I just wish Tree House wasn't so far away,otherwise I would drink this beer all the time.Trying this makes me very excited, to try some of their other offerings.If you love a good New England IPA / juice bomb,try and get this beer by any means necessary.This beer is pretty much perfect.Actually,this is the best beer I've had since I started doing these reviews.Cheers to Tree House,and Cheers to the gentleman who I traded with to obtain it.I hope you enjoy the Wide Awake,as much as I enjoyed the Haze!!!",0.6620460900310166,5.0,0.9905
Society & Solitude #4,"1434th Review on BA Growler to HF Stem 750ml  Thanks to RudZud & Jlindros for sending this.  App- As soon as the cap was popped on the growler I was excited. Pours out a deep orange with a bit of a unfiltered haze to it. The head was pure white with a great amount of cling to it.  Smell- Awesomely hoppy but not over done. Not boozy. Rich notes of creme come up with deep notes of tropical fruits. Guava, mango, pineapple. So lush you just smell for a while. I get only small amounts of pine coming up as well.  Taste- OMG, like Guy Fieri says, ""Welcome to flavor town"" This is a great example of a well made DIPA with huge hops, great citrus and incredible balance. Not overtly piney or boozy on the flavor. Great layers of creamy hops and dank citrus.  Mouth- Incredible smooth and lush with a low medium body and a paired well bubbly medium carbonation. The creamy notes just stay with you and at the same time entice you into drinking this way too quickly.  Drink- I think I finally have something to suggest to people other than HT. This is like HT's little brother that is slowly going through a growth spurt ready to kick big bros ass.",0.6565064010827166,4.5,0.9905
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"This would be my favorite beer of all time if it weren't recently dethroned by its brother, Vanillabean. One of the best liquids on the planet. Every year I build it up, but it just never ceases to blow me away.   Appearance: black tar, with a thin mocha head that soon dissipates into psychedelic swirls--coats the sides of the cup with a translucent film that does not budge. LOOK AT IT!!!  Nose: HAHAHAAA!!! All I can do is laugh. What kind of BEER is this?!?! Toasted oak, bourbon, molasses, vanilla, butter toffee, still a trace of dark fruit, and then just so much more that I just can't even describe--maybe the byproducts of yeast reactions that I don't understand--I don't know.   Flavor: Holy god. This stuff brings tears to your eyes. It just makes you shake your head and wonder how the hell something like this is even made by humans. This is in the same tier as Napa reserve cabernets and Ardbeg single malts. In the words of my Uncle, upon trying it for the first time two years ago, ""HOLY SHIT THERE ARE FLAVORS FLYING AT ME FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE!!!"" Again, dark chocolate, buttery charred oak, bourbon, vanilla, intelligentsia espresso, yeast flavors, mineral flavors, molasses, port, fruit, but listing these words simply do not do it justice. A lot of oak aged beers have a similar flavor profile to this....but just do not even approach the mind-boggling sophistication of this elixir. Astoundingly good.  Mouthfeel: Heavenly. Like a mature, top-tier wine or a mature, barrel strength whiskey--oily, viscous, creamy, silky,....but way heavier!   Drinkability: what more can I say? I still vividly recall the first time I tried this at Dark Lord Day '06. I had never tried any version of DL before, and while waiting in line to pick up my bottles, a friend of a friend walked up to me and handed me the rest of his cup and I swear I do not remember anything that happened for the next five minutes. Time slowed down, others' voices became distant...I had an out of body experience. All I could do was shake my head, flail my arms, and grin like an idiot.   And as others have attested, somehow the vanilla bean version is better...so do I have to change one of my 5's to 4.5?",0.6234074179703532,5.0,0.9905
Haze,"Goodness, me. A gift from a friend, just back from Western MA.   I thought it looked a little light - a beautiful, bright, luminous light orange, hazy as the name suggests, but it seemed pale for the stats. Everything else, though. Ripping fruits on the nose, this drinks like the most perfectly balanced mimosa - fresh squeezed orange juice and kinetic effervescence...it's impossible to connect this beer with its alcohol content until after you've finished it, it is just so light, and so lovely. Soft and creamy on the tongue, it leaves the exactly perfect trail of crisp bitterness on the release.  I loved this beer, very close to the best one I've ever had, I think. I was shattered when it was gone.",0.6814480547574099,5.0,0.9905
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Got this one at the Bierkoning in A'dam.   From a 750 into a snifter VIntage 2010 Bottled 3 June 2013 300g per liter  APPEARANCE: Pours a small, off-white, light red head with decent retention. Clear poppy red in color with almost no carbonation evident. Head fades quickly and it looks almost flat in the glass rather quickly. Pretty color, though I wish the head made more of an impression.   SMELL: Lots of raspberries on the nose, with tart lemons, some funk, and just a hint of acidity. Slightly one dimensional, though the raspberries are quite lovely.   TASTE: Raspberries up front with tart lemon sourness and oak notes at the swallow. Bold and lingering finish of tart lemon, sweet-sour raspberries, some funky flavors and wood from the barrels. A hint of bitterness finds its way through too. Well balanced between the sour lambic and tart, sweet red fruits.   PALATE: Medium body and modest carbonation. Creamy and fuller on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes dry and puckering. A touch of acidity lingers. Good feel here.   OVERALL: This is really nice. Lots of good fruit flavor with a solid lambic as a base, and a full, creamy feel to support the show. Well balanced and very flavorful. The look was a little lack-luster, though we can forgive that for sure. Good stuff and well worth checking out. Recommended.",0.7142855115594459,4.0,0.9905
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Massive thanks to Francois for sharing. 2007 vintage.  A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a dark cherry juice hue with a thin head that faded immediately to leave thin thin wisps.  S - Aromas of dry tart cherries, light vanilla. Incredibly fragrant cherries and pits.   T - Taste is similar to the nose, incredibly dry cherries, just intense tasty cherry notes. Good funky musty basement. Really good, great tart cherry notes.   M - Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, crisp, clean.   O - Overall this beer was really excellent. Wonderful cherry notes, excellent tartness really well crafted. Holy cow.

Beatification,"Batch 5, 375ml corked and caged offering poured into a long stemmed tulip. The brew appears a hazed golden color with a finger of white head. The cap slowly fades but maintains a layering across the top from continuously rising bubbles of carbonation. A light swirl revives the cap and paints some patches of lacing on the glass.  The aroma of this brew is pretty darn fantastic. It smells lemony and lactic with a fruited quality that is almost like white grape juice. More smells bring out a greater focus on the barrel aging with a scent of moist cork and a bit of sweetness mildly reminiscent of vanilla that integrates so well with the previously described white grape juice scent. This brew has me salivating pretty bad even before I take my first sip. As the brew warms up and is swirled, a bit of a funky cheese note evolves.  The flavor of this brew is quite acidic. This ranks up there with some of the most sour offerings I have had. A flavor of lemony tartness blends into a tannic bacterial spike of acidity that rips the moisture right out of your mouth. The lactic edge gives way to some barrel flavor of moist cork mingled with layers of funk that are somewhat barnyard-like and earthen almost like something along the lines of must and cobwebs? The finish is a mixture of earth and acidity that is so sharp yet dry that you have to dive right back in for another sip. When small sips are taken, this brew really drives home flavors of lemon juice. When bigger gulps are taken, more earthen flavors are present with almost a bit of mineral edge.  This is a light bodied brew with a lively amount of carbonation that is not over done. It is light and lively in the feel with a brutal dryness and acidity to it. This is really a fantastic brew that nearly borders on being too much. I have waiting a very long time to try this and it has met my expectations quite well. The nose on this is unreal and while the flavor is deep and complex, it is a harsh bugger that is not for the faint of heart. I guess this goes without saying, wild ale fans, this is a must-try.",0.7003624078798486,4.5,0.9905
Sip Of Sunshine,"Really great beer. Enjoyed it more than Double Sunshine. Here goes:  A: Clear golden-orange color. Pours a massive head that leaves incredible lacing. Perfect.  S: Bouquet of flowers; very complex. Grassiness, grapefruit, orange, and citrus peel.  T: Follows the nose in terms of flavor profile. Incredible complexity. A little too dank to be rated perfectly, though; however, it's certainly not ovebearing. Provides smooth, easy drinking despite the relatively high abv.  F: Crisp, smooth, and perfectly drinkable. Amazing how light the mouthfeel is despite the beer being very high in alcohol content.  O: A great beer. Probably my favorite from the day at Lawson's.",0.7242105736852561,4.75,0.9905
Black Tuesday,"Huge thanks to mdfb79 for gifting me this bad boy. Cheers Dan!  This was a 2012 vintage Lot 4.3 - aged approximately 3 years Domed the full bottle – FW snifter glass - 10.06.15   The pour is dark shadowy black body without waiver. Not even some dark brown mixed in. Sits still in my glass with a only small filmy layer of dark tan foam forming over. Even it circles out to a halo rather quickly. Low on the stick factor but with some nice boozy legs to it. Tons of fudgy bourbon soaked chocolate goodness exudes from the glass. Sweet molasses, vanilla-coconut, and dark fruits. The taste is divine as all of the flavors have melded together in lavish decadence. Gourmet style chocolate with hints of coffee, toasted oak, vanilla cream, caramelized sugars, coconut, dark fruit, alcohol, and some loamy earthiness. Full bodied with a richly sleek feel. Not the smoothest beer ever but rather amazing in this moment. The alcohol is ever present and warming but without any obstruction. It actually helps cut back all the sweetness along with some moderate amount of bitterness there. With just 3 years on it this was fan-freaking-tasty! Maturity is where it’s at.   I had generally written this one off to the hype train but this has got to be one of the best dessert beers ever had.",0.6509412284957103,4.75,0.9905
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"When the mother batch of Double Cream Stout doesn't turn out, the stout show must go on. The other half, the Expedition Stout is ready to play. Without the blend that would normally make up Black Note, the Russian imperial stout stands alone. A long slumber in bourbon barrels and straight to your tastebuds is a rare culinary treat that simply exudes decadence in a glass.  Onyx-black and with an ominous tar sheen, the beer whips together a short but sturdy lather to endure the session. Its powerful scent is of all things burnt. Roasted espresso bean, dark chocolate, walnut, grilled fruit and spicy whisky all align in the nose for a heavily decadent, dessert-like aroma. As its burnt sweetness slathers on the early palate, a mesmerizing taste of burnt marshmallow, black-strap molasses and the darkest coffee roast imaginable shows power and seduction immediately.  Lavishly malty on the middle palate, the bittersweet chocolates seep deep into the tastebuds along with walnut brownie mix, chocolate covered espresso bean, campfire and grilled dark fruit. Grape, berry, currant and cherry offer a mild vinous twang that extends effortlessly into the realm of oak-soaked char, vanilla, coconut and caramel. Spicy, roasty and rounded with bourbon ball candies give this seriously robust beer a power punch of flavor that's head and shoulders above the rest.  Full, lavish and viscous, the beer sticks to the mouth with a malty sweetness that's unwavering. Roast acidity, spicy whisky, hints of tartness and peppercorn keeps the complex flavor coming as the stout balances to near pin-point perfection. Its a rare taste that extends well into the next sip, rewarding the imbiber with continued culinary excellence with each and every grace of the lip.",0.6731087442514928,4.75,0.9904
Society & Solitude #4,"I made the pilgrimage to the Hill Farmstead Brewery in early August and picked up a 2 liter growler of this particularly fruity Imperial IPA brewed with Citra and Galaxy hops. Why 2 liters? Let's just say I couldn't resist. Beer was poured from the growler into my St. Bernardus chalice. Review is from notes.   Appearance (5/5): A medium strength pour from the growler produces a luxuriant 2 finger, white head of foam that sits atop a body of opaque, peach orange colored beer. A significant amount of sticky lacing lines the sides of the glass. This is one of the most picturesque IPAs I have seen: it has the signature HF peach orange hue and opaqueness due to its being unfiltered and demonstrates ample head and lacing. Everything you want to see in a beer, nothing less.   Smell (5/5): Notes of pineapple, tropical fruit, some pine. There is a distinct earthiness to the S & S #4's aroma that I really like. There are faint hints of malt that push back, albeit gently and, ultimately, ineffectually against the tidal wave of fruity hop aromas.   Taste (5/5): The first thing anyone notices about this IPA is the absurd level of fruitiness going on: mango, pineapple, orange, passion fruit, grapefruit, and cantaloupe. A little piney flavor is worked in there as well. The bitterness is medium-ish, to put it technically; hop astringence is less prevalent than hop sweetness and fruitiness. S & S's bitterness grows as you consume and the hop oils saturate the tongue, however. A nice biscuity malt provides a nice bit of token resistance. Minimal alcohol presence in the back does not distract at all from the wonderful hop flavor experience. Legit perfection here.   Mouthfeel (5/5): Society and Solitude #4 has a medium body and good medium-light carbonation. This is a very smooth beer. Unlike many IPA's, this one doesn't have much prickliness to it. It is highly drinkable and never feels thick or cloying because of body, poor carbonation problems, or resinous-ness.   Overall (5/5): Hill Farmstead Society and Solitude #4 is, simply put, incredible beer and is one of my favorite Imperial IPAs. It is a beautiful, exceptionally fruity, mildly bitter, and immensely drinkable beer that begs to be had fresh. Whenever you see it on tap or at the brewery in Greensboro Bend, VT, make sure to snag some. I hope all you hop-lovers enjoy it as much as I did.",0.6835602991021337,5.0,0.9904
Sip Of Sunshine,"L: Good looking beer, pretty good head retention, lots of lace, nice golden orange color S: Two primary notes, candied citrus and dank resin/pine. T: Crisp malts, slightly toasted sweetness, very dry. Contrasted by hop finish, bitter and resinous. Bitterness is soft but definitely assertive. Alcohol is barely detectable F: Very silky and smooth. Probably some really good water chemistry going on here because the body on this is super light, kind of reminds me a the body on a helles, just easy drinking and refreshing. The only thing that holds this back from maximum crushability is the bitterness lends a bit of astringency to this. O: Not my first time with this beer, was conflicted with it in the past and I agree to this day. I think its really good, has some amazing qualities, but also think its a bit overrated for sure. Kind of just reminds me of a standard west coast IPA with a much higher price point. Certainly not to say it isn't a really good beer, it is, but I can get 6 packs of Alpine beers for way cheaper more regularly, and IMO this is no better than that. Would drink again if offered but probably won't seek this out again.",0.6753829565437661,3.75,0.9904
Society & Solitude #4,"750 mL growler poured into a Kate the Great snifter.  Appearance - Very hazy orange. Small white head. Light, but almost contiguous layer of foam remains atop the beer. Surprisingly leggy as I swirl it.  Smell - A two-faced smell. First aroma is a gigantic pineapple and mango flavor. Almost like there's mango juice in it. Sweet smelling. Behind it is a distinct grapefruit pungency. Almost as if there are two glasses of beer in front of me and I'm smelling both at the same time.  Taste - The flavor lacks a bit of the depth the aroma has. The flavors blend better, but they are also a touch diminished. The grapefruit is more dominant than the tropical fruits and the grapefruit becomes much more dominant in the finish. Builds to a strong bitter grapefruit finish.  Mouthfeel - Low-ish carbonation. Probably due to the growler. Medium body. The bitterness is extreme, though, much like Society & Solitude #3. Like chewing on a grapefruit in the end.  Overall - Everything is great except the finish. Still an extremely enjoyable IPA. Maybe not something I could drink 5 of like Heady, but still excellent. Please continue these hop experiments, Mr. Hill, but cut back on those bittering hops, please!",0.697098356214636,4.5,0.9904
Beatification,"From 04/14/12 notes. Thanks to everyone who brought this to our DC Sour Tasting; never had it and have wanted to for a while. Got to sample a near vertical, as we had batched 1, PH1, 2, 3, and 4 side by side. I found batches 1 and PH1 very different fro the rest, as they were much sweeter then the others, and found batch 2 to be the sourest, almost too sour. Batch 3 was amazing and my favorite, so the one I'm reviewing. My order went:  3, Ph1, 1, 2, 4  a - Pours a transparent golden color with one inch of bright white head and moderate carbonation evident.  s - Smells of tart cherries, sour fruits, citrus, lemon, oak, fruity malts, very acedic. Awesome nose, with just a ton of sour fruits.  t - Tastes of very sour cherries, sour dark fruits, and fruity malts, lemon, citrus, light funk, acedic, oak, vinegar. More sour dark fruit, especially cherries, in the taste, and a inty bit funky. Awesome, perfect tasting sour for me.  m - Medium body and moderate carbonation. Acedic mouthfeel.  o - Overall I thought this was an amazing sour; probably my favorite RR beer to date. All batches of this were very good, btu Batch 3 is unreal right now. Highly recommended, definitely looking for more bottles of this one.",0.6532608376677653,5.0,0.9904
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Bottle shared with drabmuh earlier this summer. Thanks Matt! Review from notes.  2007 vintage. Served side by side with Cantillon Rosé de Gambrinus.  This beer has a gorgeous appearance - a reddish-purple hue, with a pink foam head that sticks around longer than expected, and leaves no lacing, as is expected.   Wonderful aromas of raspberries, hay, barnyard funk. Classic Cantillon scents - simply wonderful. I could sniff this beer for several minutes without taking a drink. The aroma alone is worthy of praise and attention.  This beer is truly excellent. While definitely tart, I would not say that it is incredibly sour. Lou Pepe Framboise is extremely drinkable, and has a much milder acetic finish than the Rosé de Gambrinus. Very pleasant lingering tart raspberry aftertaste. A terrific offering from a fabulous brewery.",0.6468147804450367,4.5,0.9904
Coolship Red,"This one pours a light pink-ish red, fully clear, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.  This smells absolutely incredible- jammy and seedy raspberry, both sour and just slightly sweet, with tannic red wine, oak, and a musty funk that's just delightful.  There's a lot to unpack with this beer. It's probably the best beer I've ever had from Allagash- and that's saying quite a lot, as they make awesome beer. The raspberry flavor is bold and beautiful, but miraculously doesn't dominate, as the base beer is slightly prickly, with a warm musty barnyard funk- earthy but inviting. There's some nice oak and red wine flavors as well. This is just so well rounded.  This is light bodied, and really crisp and clean, with a good level of carbonation for the style.  This is absolutely a home run, and one of the best fruited sours in the country.",0.6961844009734429,4.75,0.9904
Haze,"A million thanks to Jon for this can of Haze. My very first.   Pint can, dated 10/02/18 poures into a tulip at 45F. Pours a very hazy milky dark orange juice color. Definitely juicy looking. Adorned with a finger of off-white head that hangs around for a good while, leaving a bit of lacing. Edit: second pour dumped HUGE bits of sediment, the size of small pebbles, that sank to the bottom. I'm not gonna dock points for that, because these things can happen. I drink a lot of wild ales, so this does not alarm me.  Nose is a mellow melange of orange peel, peaches, apricot, some very ripe mango, papaya, and a very faint earthiness. Absolutely stunning notes of peaches. There's a really unique fruity thing I'm picking up, but I can't put my finger on it.   Palate brings a hop zesty tang. There's a HUGE honeydew presence going on here. That's precisely what I get upfront. It was familiar, and it couldn't put my finger on it, but it took me a minute, and it's definitely honeydew. That was also the note on the nose that I got. There's a pineapple-like acidity to it too, that comes right up and pinches your tongue. Very little citrus rind bitterness. There's definitely some building bitterness in the finish, but it's a very piney/resinous bitterness. Green leafy things. A little bit of dankness. Mostly pine. This is a honeydew/peach/pine profile.  Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, with a little bit of chew. Quite soft, but this isn't as soft as Julius. Julius is a liquid down pillow. This is still wonderfully creamy. A solid medium carbonation gives it some lift, and amplifies that acidic tingle.  Overall: I do like this very much. It's got a lot going for it. I'm comparing it to Julius, and I shouldn't, because Haze is a DIPA, and Julius doesn't have the D. This is a fantastic double IPA. But ad a whole, I have to say I prefer Julius, as I find it superior, as a beer in general. This is great, though, and I will drink it again, if I can ever get my hands on it. You should drink it too, because it's worth it.",0.6708245663254843,4.5,0.9903
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"L -- Pours a fairly hazed bight orange with a dense, white, three-finger head produced with gentle pour. Fabulous, pillowy retention and excellent lacing.  S -- Fruity yeast esters (mostly banana), clove, pepper, nutmeg, pilsner malts, wheat, and a little lemon T -- Taste largely follows the nose. Quite similar to Allagash White, but with a much more pleasant spiciness and overall better flavor balance. Also getting cinnamon, cardamon, and anise F -- Refreshing, quaffable, and flavorful. Well carbonated, but not overly fizzy. Amazingly soft mouthfeel, thanks to the wheat O -- My favorite wheat beer to date, much more flavorful and well-balanced than most.

Juicy,"Bottle (2012)  Acquired via trade Thanks, mkabull!  This one does gush upon opening! Be warned!  Burnt apricot or peach flesh in color with a quickly forming, creamy off-white head of very small bubbles. Nice retention and this leaves messy lacing. Very pretty saison.  Definite citrus in the aroma, along with a concentrated, rotting fruit character (in a good way!), a mild to moderate funk character, and a bit of a champagne or white wine character that's tough to describe but definitely adds to the overall enjoyment and complexity of the aroma.  The flavor follows suit, though the flavor is more balanced than the aroma, as the (rotting, strong) citrus character is tamed down nicely by the complex, earthy funk, and champagne/white wine flavors. Some brick flavor as well, which adds nicely. This is delightful.  Medium bodied with high carbonation.  A lovely, enjoyable saison from Hill Farmstead. Shocking!",0.7344026598362928,4.5,0.9903
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Bottle was staring at me in the fridge as I was out of beer.

Absolutely love the mouthfeel on this one, smooth, smooth, smooth.  O: I can't wait to get tickets for Darklord Day 2013 to have more of this lovely brew. I am looking forward to getting a bottle of the vanilla bean version next year, as this years vanilla bean DL on tap was just amazing.

Beatification,"750mL b3 courtesy of joeneugs. This beer froze in the mail, nearly exploded and now trying it, somehow it hasn’t lost one bit of its spectacularity. The cork pops with good pressure, pours with good, spritzy carbonation leaving a small, white head that dissipates quickly. Looks cloudy, beautiful grapefruit juice in color like a top notch geuze. Aroma is similar to the best geuzes I’ve tried: lemon sorbet, fresh grapefruit juice, grapefruit rind, white pepper. Taste is bright, fresh grapefruit and lemon with quenching tartness. Not very funky or horsey- more fresh citrus. Some oak, sour peaches, and Granny Smith apples shine through. The definite hit of our tasting. Thanks Joe!  375mL b2 courtesy of MrChopin. I’ve been debating about upping the score from 4.3 to 4.4 seeing that I dream of this beer on an almost constant basis. This, my third time trying the beer, has confirmed that it is time. Beatification b2 is so drying and so wildy complex with spicy cedar, drying oak, lemon/lime/orange, leather, peaches, apricots...it is an all encompassing sour experience that is never acedic, never citric. Just spot on perfection. My notes for this say, ""It’s like the world ended and I was resurrected in paradise."" Later on into the night my notes will say ""HOLY SHIT."" 10/26/2010 9/4/9/5/18=4.5",0.6513458714379039,4.5,0.9902
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"A deep bow towards LambicPentameter for this 12 oz. bottle. Expy Stout was my wife’s gateway beer into the dark side…for years I heard “I don’t like dark beers”. One night in the middle of 2008 she gave in to my offer of an Expedition Stout & a few months later we were hunting Darkness on tap together. She won’t touch her previous favorite (“A Kolsch” she sniffs now).   The pour is eye-patch black with a ribald head that fades faster than a Twins starting pitcher. The nose isn’t overwhelming, but nice fudge, sweet malts, vanilla, touch of bourbon. Not objectionable. The beer, not the pitching. THAT was highly objectionable.   Expedition Stout – Bourbon Barrel Aged is a barrel showcase. Massive bourbon presence along with a thick, coating mouthfeel puts me immediately in mind of a slightly smaller cousin to Bourbon County Stout (like free safety vs. linebacker). The base is there but muted: slight roast, malt sweetness, liquid fudge, great depth, but without the stone fruit that haunts some years (& which I’m not fond of), with just a shadow of hops. Vanilla follows, along with a finishing touch of spice, so I’m going to swear these were aged in rye whiskey barrels. A sipping beer. I need a fire.   Simply decadent. The barrel & the base work together like Buxton & Sano. If only they could pitch. A truly outstanding beer.",0.6234031110183641,4.5,0.9902
Nelson,"had this on tap. beautiful pour, way hazier than i would have thought - completely opaque. a dense bright white head hangs around for a while and leaves tons of lace. on nose is pine, dankness, grapefruit, citrus peel. this mostly follows on the palate, but there is also a white grape note and a super pithy herbaceous character. some citrus, lemon, grapefruit, orange, showing up as well. good malt presence throughout, and a nice hit of mellow spice from the rye. mouthfeel is on point! this was an absolute pleasure to drink after having so many hazed NE beers - great balance between juicy citrus notes, danky pine and green character, and that touch of spice from the rye. excellent brew!",0.6894578169867329,4.75,0.9902
Juicy,"This is a gusher...like a chemical reaction once opened. Note: you really gotta let this baby warm up to let it shine.  A: Beautiful shade of vibrant golden orange. Largest head I've ever seen in a beer. Fizzy, foamy, bubbly, bright white. One of the longest lasting heads, as well. Never really goes away with great retention and lace. This deserves more than a 5.  S: Very complex. Bursts of ripe, sour fruit. Fizzy, chalky, densely sweet sugar. Funk and wood. Some citrus and the NZ hops if you grt deep. Give it a stir and the aromas explode again. I found my nose buried in this for minutes at a time. A pleasure for the senses. I've honestly never spent more time smelling a beer in my life. Again, higher than a 5.  T: Oh yeah, I get to drink this beer, too! Everything in the nose but fruitier, hoppier, a bit funkier and very dry.  M: Perfect carbonation, very dry and fruity, but a bit chalky and cloying. It's going to be hard to enjoy other beers of this style after this near perfection.  O: I'd say it's more of an American Wild than a Saison. Worth the hype but that's easy for me to say because I was able to easily acquire a bottle. I was expecting it to change my life and it didn't, but it definitely blew my mind. Fantastic beer.",0.6497001933577665,5.0,0.9902
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Pure Heaven. SOOO DAMN TASTY. BEST STOUT I HAVE EVER HAD. Poured from 12 oz into a snifter dark black with virtually no head. What little head there is disappears into nothing very quickly. S- deep rich notes of roast, huge boozy bourbon followed by rich coffee. There is a subtle maple scent that follows the coffee in the back. T- delicious flavor with the bourbon and the sweet vanilla, oak barrel. Lastly, after the swallow there's a strong maple presence that sits in your mouth for a long time and it develops and lasts for a long time and you don't want it to go away. Strong chocolate and vanilla notes also seep in during the mix. M- thick, creamy, velvety. The way a stout should feel. No carbonation. Completely coats your mouth and throat all the way down. O- Best stout i've every had. The flavors blend perfectly and each flavor is detectable. It's amazingly delicious.",0.6843453675565042,5.0,0.9902

Mild lacing  Smell: 4.5 Sour funk with rocket candy, lemon, sour cherry. Pick up a slight oak notes from the barrel as well as you can imagine some bourbon notes. Good intensity of the aroma.  Taste: 4.5 Moderate sour funk with a good acidity across the pallet. Sour cherry flavor dominates. Backgorund ale base with slight malt provide contrasting sweetness. There's slight notes of barrel. Overall, good intensity of the flavor.  Mouthfeel: 4 Moderate sourness with good acidity and sharp finish. Mild mod carbonation ; quite appropriate offering a slight cleansing of the pallet. Mild to moderate viscosity.  Overall: 4.5 A very enjoyable beer great use of cherries and barrel offers a nice complexity of flavors, Great moderately sour finish. Nice ale base. Very easy to drink. Highly recommend.",0.7129051224533652,4.5,0.9901
Madagascar,"A- This beer hits the glass in a thick, black pour that kind of looks and feels like chocolate milk. A small head of about a centimeter forms and is medium tan in color. Most of the head ends up sticking around a good while and leaving a solid amount of lacing on the glass.  S- Sweet lactose sugar and chocolate greet the nose first on the beer. Just a hint of vanilla sweetness mixes in next before the barrels lend their flavors to the scent. The oak and char are more prominent on the end of the smell. Overall impression of the scent of the beer is sweet upfront with balancing burnt malts and barrel on the back end.  T- The beer starts you off with a mildly bitter bang of burnt malts and chocolate right up front. The semi-sweet nature of the chocolate takes over for a brief moment before the barrel characteristics move in and give a bit of oak and char spiciness. Right after the barrel on the very end of the drink, the vanilla sweetness kicks in more noticeably. The lingering flavor on the tongue is what I imagine licking the inside of a bourbon barrel to be like, with spicy char and oak mixing in with vanilla sweetness.  M- Thick and creamy is the best way to describe this milk stout. The lactose sweetness in the beer lends itself to thickening the flavor up and making the body heavy and smooth. Outside of the bourbon barrel flavors, there is no detectable alcohol or warmth to be had.  Overall, this beer feels like it should when you drink it, but the flavors are a little less than I was expecting. The vanilla is definitely a subtle flavor that mixes with the barrel and malts rather than being a standout flavor. This is a very good imperial sweet stout, but I was hoping for something a little stronger in the vanilla department.",0.6740942143634201,4.0,0.9901
Black Tuesday,"2012 vintage 19.2  A: Is not an incredibly dark beer - murky brown/ruby red tinges along the sides of the glass. Sits pitch black in the glass. No head to speak of at all.  S: Amazing! Incredibly balanced and not very boozy at all, really. Sweet vanilla, coconut, and bourbon caramel. Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, some booze soaked fruits - plums and cherries. Some oak is present as well. There is a distinctive spiciness - cinnamon and gingerbread. Just a very inviting, strongly aromatic, brilliantly balanced. -note: I'd give this a 5 but I want to see what CR brings to the table  T: Very sweet but balanced. The sweetness counters the alcohol so well. Rich chocolate, tons of sweet vanilla/coconut/oak, some booze soaked dark fruits, cherry juice, and some coffee at the finish. The spiciness from the aroma comes in at the finish as well.  P: Full, but not very viscous. Very smooth. There is a pop of carbonation that subsides with some swirling.   O: An astounding malt beverage. The impeccable balance and complexity makes for an exceedingly enjoyable drinking experience.",0.6975151627380554,4.75,0.9901
Society & Solitude #4,"Just picked this up at the brewery yesterday. It was tasty then, and I'm sure it will be now.  Pours a very nice head from a growler, big fluffy 1.5 finger head that fades pretty slowly and leaves bits of lacing, over very hazy peach-orange colored beer with a light rosy hue.  Nose brings plenty of hops, fresh fruity citrus hops, with a tropical fruit bringing a bit of grapefruit, light musty almost resin but not quite resinous, a hint of clementine and tangerine, and even touch of pineapple. Just a touch of a light amber pale malt underneath it all.   Taste starts with a hint of sweetness and some amber malts with a touch of a reddish malt flavor. Then hops, it doesn't get too bitter but a nice hop full flavor. Hops bring mostly citrus and tropical fruits, with a nice grapefruit flavor, hints of citrus tangerine and clementine like flavors again, touch of a pineapple and even slight spicy hops. Mostly clean and a light musty fresh hops. Juicy light tropical fruit juice. Finish is drier with a fairly bigger hop bite, hint of spiciness of hops and some light citrus and tropical fruits. Just a hint of what could be seen as booze but barely.  Mouth is med to slightly bigger bodied, fluffy, with decent carb.  Overall quitegood, nice hop character without a big bitterness, quite drinkable, booze hidden fairly well, just a light malt to attempt to balance it, and lots of tropical fruit juice flavors.",0.6756795091448502,4.5,0.9901
Enjoy By IPA,"4.20.16 had on 4.20.16 bottled on 3.14.16.   Wow, what a beer! I have not had the Enjoy by 4.20. It sells out fast around here. Now I can see why. The hops are perfectly displayed-pineapple, mango, orange, tangerine, grapefruit. I thought the pine and dank were in line with the rest of the hop's flavor components. The grapefruit and subtle resin kick up in the finish, lingering just a bit. The overall bitterness is moderate at best. It starts low and slow, peaking in the finish. But even the finishing bitterness is mellow enough that you don't think twice about going in for another sip. The hoppy bitterness is softened by pleasantly sweet, and light bready malts. There is some caramel in the malt as well. The malt is always present providing the perfect balance needed for a world class beer, which this beer is. I really enjoy the body of this brew too, smooth and slightly coating/creamy. Alcohol is well covered, which makes this a dangerous beer. All of this contributes to a well balanced, harmonious, super drinkable brew. If you have the opportunity, don't pass on it. This is truly a must have if you are an IPA fan.",0.7159099685752862,4.75,0.9901
Juicy,"Huge, huge thanks to Evan for this one. Served in a Hill Farmstead wine glass.  Slow gusher as I pop the cap. Nothing big, but have a glass at the ready. Pour yields a deep peach-colored brew with a nice two-finger white head. Good retention and plenty of lacing as it goes down. Thin cap throughout.  The initial nose provides a good dose of honeydew alongside tropical fruit. Mild funk and white-wine character in the background. Touch of citrus rind and very light straw.  Flavor is incredible. Absolutely fantastic. Notes of melon and white wine overlay a very light acidity. Just a touch of oak in the background as well as some mild underlying Brett.   Body is light with a mild underlying bitterness. Acidity is quite light and is more along the lines of a mild citrus character rather than straight lactic acid. There's a touch of creaminess in the background. Perhaps not creamy, but just a bit of wheat character.   Overall, on the level with the best Hill Farmstead beers. Phenomenal, to say the least. Can we officially name Hill Farmstead the best brewery in the world?",0.7067203286777054,4.75,0.9901
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"This beer is incredible. It pours very thick, with a hint of a mocha-colored head. The smell is dark chocolate,maple, coffee. This is the best aroma from a beer I've ever gotten. All the aromas blend together perfectly. The taste follows the nose. It is a little bit too sweet on the finish for me, but that's like saying Kate Upton's hair is too long, it's a personal critique of something (someone) that's damn near perfect. The mouthfeel is super viscous, and super great. I was scared this beer wouldn't live up to the hype, but it is most definitely, 100%, worth it. Amazing beer.",0.6413423099973146,5.0,0.9901

Taste: opens with maple syrup. sweet caramel and toffee. a strong barleywine malty flavor comes through with a strong dose of medium to lighter grains. the barrel comes in more towards the end with medium strength bourbon and oak.  Mouthfeel: thick and syrupy. sweet. alcohol warmth and lingering.  Overall: a top notch beer as its reputation claims. great balance between a malty and sweet barleywine and a rich bourbon aged beer. love the balance on this one.,0.6824919925500925,4.5,0.99
Chocolate Rain,"2012 vintage bottled, served in fff teku at the abs ballers meeting.   Obsidian with ruby tint, no lasting head or lacing, strong alcohol legs.  Strongest vanilla I have gotten off a beer on the nose, boozy, chocolate. The vanilla hit quickly and bites hard but lets go long enough to enjoy the roasted coco, oak, sweet molasses notes. Very sweet, pretty boozy, but very pleasant bourbon heat.  Full body, low carbonation, chewy, warm etoh.  Amazing beer but still needs a year or two longer on that vintage for the vanilla to mellow, I was bummed the coco nibs didnt shine through as much, but still, this is liquid gold, eould love to try older years!",0.6171844195979413,4.75,0.99
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"the shorty bottle in a snifter via the brewery. This beast of a stout pours  a deep obsidian with a nice brown head of brown foam that subsides to a thick ring, thin pool, and showcases nice light lacing. Nose of coffee, dark cocoa fudge, vanilla, heavy bourbon, heavy oak, and moderately heavy char. Flavors follow but surpass with  presentation of bourbon and heavy char awash in heavy oak notes with moderate vanilla and heavy coffee with char and crème brûlée brown sugar notes on the rear. Excellent mouth feel; full body, slick, coating, rich, and warming with low carbonation and a touch of raisin bourbon note on the rear with warmth.

Green,"This beer is magical. Canned on 3/15, it produces a cloudy orange appearance with significant head and plenty of lace from start to finish. It smells like sex on a platter. Pineapple and clean sweat. Imagine making love to Elisha Cuthbert and all you can smell is her hair, and that Victoria's Secret body spray she uses, liberally. This is that smell. Fresh, over ripe and bursting with aroma. Mango lassi in beer form. The taste follows but with different layers of tropical goodness, and that tongue smacking bitterness that you expect and deserve from an IPA. Seared peach skin, orange rind, gentle coriander, grainy cracker, faint pear. All of that. The feel is Hayden Panettiere on the tongue. So smooth, so soft, so gentle. It lays on the tongue just long enough to remind you how good Tree House does what they do best - IPAs. Believe the hype; this company is the upper echelon of IPA. They never fail to disappoint. All scores warranted, all pours are the shit. Larrrrrrrrrrrge.",0.6361404297386605,4.75,0.99
Beatification,"Pours a very light straw color. It is lighter than blonde and just barely lemon-tinted in the glass with a nice bright white head. Plenty of carbonation. The smell is complex. There is some tartness/acid scent but very funky to my nose. I get more funk than anything. Like preserved lemons maybe. The taste is sour on the front end but bright in the tartness. This tastes like a lemon sour patch kid to me. The sour is balanced so well and doesn't finish acetic. You get a bit of the wood and the sourness really smoothes out as this warms. I really enjoy lemons, so this beer really hits the spot. It's just this side of sour to not be completely thirst quenching, which is good because it's not like anybody has a big enough stash to throw back a few of these. Probably as balanced and as well made as any sour I've had. Slightly ahead of Cantillon Gueuze for me in terms of bright lemony lambic.",0.6842309721864472,4.75,0.99
Chocolate Rain,"750ml bottle, 19,5% Abv.  Served lightly chilled in an over sized wine glass.  Bottled on: 02/09/2012 Lot 30  Thanks a million to futura123 for hooking me up with this bottle.   Appearance: Hmmm, Chocolate Rain is far lighter than I expected. The body is dark brown and a back light shows a lot of deep red along the edges of the glass. A rough pour generates a small tan coloured head that dissipates almost instantly and leaves no lacing. As one would expect from a beer that is 19,5%, a swirl coats the glass in thick, yellow tinted alcohol legs.   Smell: Mmmmm this smells absolutely amazing! There is not as much chocolate as I was expecting (it is no Southern Tier Choklat), but who cares when it smells this good! Notes include: Dark and milk chocolate, cocoa, bourbon, dark caramel, brown sugar, butterscotch, sweet vanilla, cocoa laced butter icing, chocolate liqueur, a ton of sweet dark fruits (cherries, raisins, dates and plums), a little oak and some molasses. For nearly 20%, there is shockingly little booze in the nose.   Taste: The flavour follows on from the nose and is absolutely delicious. Notes include: A ton of chocolate, sweet dark caramel, toffee, bourbon, brown sugar, vanilla, oak, dark fruits and some molasses. As the beer warms the alcohol becomes a little bothersome, but that has to be expected from a beer of this Abv.   Mouthfeel: The body is just shy of full, but incredibly sticky and the carbonation is of a medium-low level and nicely smooth. I could sip on a beer like this all day!   Overall: Don't get me wrong, Chocolate Rain is a phenomenal beer, but I think I preferred Black Tuesday.",0.6369126115454411,4.5,0.99
Chocolate Rain,"shoutout to LiquidDegenerate for sharing this one!  A; pours a dark brown colored body with some amber tints to it. created an off-white thin head that quickly dissipated.   S: big alcohol soaked dark fruits right up front, with an awesome sweet dark chocolate toffee/molasses and vanilla bean blats. this beast doesn't smell like its 19.5%.. and this could get dangerous quickly  T: following in stride with the nose. again, i pick up on an immense sweetness but its not overly sweet. big chocolate, toffee, alcohol soaked figs/raisins, and a bit of heat to it thats actually quite inviting. for 19.5% this is extremely smooth and the finish is an awesome creamy vanilla that helps cut out the alcohol.  M: on the ligher side of full bodied. chocolate, vanilla and touch of alcohol is left on the palate. this is really enjoyable.  O: simply an outstanding brew. extremely well balanced, and has just the right amount of sweetness to cut out the big ABV. so damn excited that I was able to try this one out! will definitely try to get one in the future. must share this!",0.6633692601097562,4.75,0.9899
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"750mL 2016 bottle poured into a Dark Lord Teku. Thanks Ray for sharing this one.   Pours a thick dark brown/nearly black body with a tan head that reduces to a ring.   Aromas are complex and inviting, with lots of bourbon and dark fruits, oak and caramel, cocoa, chocolate, some vanilla in there, alcohol heat.  Great combination of flavors on the tongue, I can taste the base beer slightly but it's really complimented with rich bourbon cake flavors, fudgy caramel brownie, dark fruits and coffee on the follow through. Pretty rich mouthfeel, medium-low carbonation, very easy drinking for 15%.   BA Dark Lord is a great example of what a BA Imperial Stout can take like without adjuncts.

Double Orange Starfish,"Drank from a 1 pint (473ml) can purchased at Aslin Beer Company, Herndon, VA Served in a teku  Cloudy, yellow-orange appearance. The nearly opaque body was topped by frothy, finger-tall, bright white crown that fell to a lasting collar. A streaky latticework of lacing stuck all along the glass.  Fantastic hoppy and clean aroma. Big tropical fruit notes. Mango and guava came through strongest. Some honeydew melon was noticeable as well. Touch of dankness. Subtle citrus notes too. Nice juicy orange presence.  The flavor profile was nearly as impressive as the nose. Really hoppy and bold but fantastically well balanced. Terrific mix of citrus and tropical fruit notes. Loads of juicy orange flesh on the front end. Bit of mango and generic tropical fruitiness too. Crisp and lemony in the center. Orange peel came through on the back end and in the finish. Some white grapefruit as well. Hint of resiny bitterness.  Terrific creamy, frothy mouthfeel. Slick, smooth and supple on the palate. The liquid contained a fine, moderate, pillowy soft effervescence.  Double Orange Starfish is an excellent double IPA with a clean, potent hop profile and just enough malty sweetness to keep the bitterness in check. Aslin continue to release hoppy beers that compete with some of the best offerings coming out of New England.",0.7192427211087724,4.5,0.9899
Coolship Red,"Consumed on 5/17/14  Note: Bottled March 20, 2014, purchased at brewery  Note 2: Review 800  Appearance: Legitimately, objectively, remarkably red - deep red tones, with some lighter pinks around the edges and some purple at its core - basically, the color of raspberries - hazy - pours with a medium-sized, light pink head and retains some wisps of a cap - doesn't leave much lacing, but it's still very pretty  Smell: I really have no choice but to describe this as ""nose-puckering,"" because it straight-up smells very sour - sharp, acidic sourness, with some damp, funky lactic aromas - an abundance of raspberry, with a ton of ripe raspberry flesh - oak becomes increasingly prominent as this warms, imparting some woody aromas and funky wood aromas - light, light touch of acetone in the back, but otherwise this is stellar  Taste: Awesomely sour, basically - among the most sour of sour beers that I have sampled - mouth puckering with a residual sourness that you can feel almost burning down your throat - sharp and acidic, as well as damp and lactic - perhaps not as much of a straight-up acidic sourness as some offerings from Cantillon (sorry, Allagash), but there's a nice mix of different kinds of sour - raspberries are big in the flavor, with tart, sour raspberry flesh - minimally sweet, just a dry, tart, sour fruitiness - oak, some wood funk, some yeasty funk, and maybe a hint of vanilla - very light hint of acetone, but it works  Mouthfeel: Medium body, low but adequate carbonation, sour and funky finish  Overall: Truly, the coolest ship  This is a gem. Intensely sour, with some great, tart raspberry flavors... And this is a fresh bottle. I can only imagine what is going to happen with this in a few years. This is definitely worth driving up to Maine to get (as well as anything they create with their coolship).",0.6987007542288898,4.5,0.9899

Deep deep red, almost crimson red, with a gorgeous 2 finger pink head that quickly dissipates to nothing. Seriously sexy looking beer.  S- Smell is pretty nice, a lot of oak and sour funk. The cherries take a backseat but are definitely along for the ride, they have a very tart aroma not as sweet as other Kriek style beers I've smelled.  T- This one tart mofo. Lots of oak and wild yeast sourness up front. Cherries come in to kick your ass mid sip. The cherries are the star of the show, very tart upfront but a nice gentle sweetness is there to help move things along the palate towards the end. Theres tons of complexity but the tartness can be overwhelming to some of the more subtle characteristics.   M- Spot on for the style. Plenty of carbonation and not too thin.   O- This is an amazing beer. Best Kriek I've had the pleasure of tasting. The Schaerbeekse cherries are truly unique and are an obvious choice to pair with lambic style beer.

Peche 'n Brett,"On To The Aroma!  Having been brewed with Brett, there is just enough of those characteristics that make me say “oooh yeah, I smell the brett.” At the same time, the peaches are the star of the show and definitely take center stage. Juicy peach, lactic acid, faint citrus juice, wisps of alcohol and a little bit of oak. After I had carefully poured a few glasses to get a taste, I sloshed the beer in the bottle so I could mix the yeast and fruit sediment up and really get that ‘rustic’ flavor that I love in Saisons. Yehp, that definitely gave a little more ‘funk’ to the aroma as a whole. Absolutely amazing.   On To The Flavor!  The flavor is where the show really starts. Crisp mouthfeel and prickly carbonation coupled with a pleasant tartness makes this a beer I can’t put down. It has that quintessential Saison yeast flavor with grain, bubble gum, lemon and a little banana on the finish when it warms. Again, once aroused the sediment in the bottom of the bottle, the Saison characteristics really come through. As it warms, the alcohol gently numbs the palate. However, at no point in my imbibing do I taste alcohol. Brett shines a little more once the beer has warmed and had the sediment aroused.   On To The Verdict!  Honestly, this is right up there with West Ashley. While West Ashley is a Wild Ale and features a more ‘sour’ flavor profile, this beer is not far behind in terms of sour Saisons and really acts as a quintessential example of the ingenuity and creativity of brewers these days. Mr. Logsdon, if you are reading this, you have made this boy very happy! Cheers!",0.655251485264544,4.5,0.9898
Chocolate Rain,"Type: 750-ml bottle (25.4 oz.)

Light-moderate dryness from tart/sourness and yeast/oak spiciness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/silky/acidic, and lightly tangy/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is amazing. Minimal warming alcohol for 9.9%. Overall this is an insane fruited Flanders red ale style! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/acidic yeast, cherries, wine/bourbon barrels, and dark/bready malt flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to drink with the balanced lactic/tannic/drying finish. Perfectly balanced complexity from all flavors. A highly amazing offering, and world class fruited sour ale. One of the best I’ve ever had.",0.6853188642126108,4.5,0.9897
Chocolate Rain,"750mL bottle, courtesy of daryk77 - cheers man, as always. Shared as we watched the end of the presidential election festivities.   Poured into a goblet. Black as pitch, slightly chestnut when held to the light, with a thin off white head that recedes into a thick, but substantial ring.   Nose is very sweet: coffee, cream, booze, vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, light burnt sugar. You can smell the weight on this.   Very tasty indeed, ""rich"" is an understatement. Boozy? At a hair under 20% of course it will be. However, I did find the sweetness and the booze more pronounced than the Tuesday. Vanilla and sugar quite prominent, though the other flavors are certainly there. Don't get me wrong, this is a damned tasty beer, but I give the edge to the Tuesday. Syrupy, velvety feel, with enough carbonation to keep the sweetness at bay.   Very enjoyable beer, definitely worth a second look if I ever come across it again.",0.6407592097826379,4.0,0.9897
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Bought this in Brugge, Belgium, September 2006...it is indeed the Oude Geuze Vintage. I could only hold out a full year before popping the cork.   A huge fluffy head that looks lighter than air sits on top of a coppery gold teaming with bubbles which are almost champagne-like in their hyperactivity. Gobs of sticky lace at first, but that falls away to minimal lacing after a bit.  Aroma reminds of good white wine, vinous and musty, dried fruits and sharp sourness...like the most decadently stinky cheese. You gotta love the funk to enjoy this.  Flavor is sour white grape, moldy cheese, leather, yogurt. Tart and puckery finish, like intensely sour apples and very young white grapes. It completely coats the mouth, and if you can feel your way through the intense puckeriness, you'll find it on the more buttery side, with modern carbonation to keep things alive and kicking. That coating had me spitting off my deck a couple times, to clear my mouth for the next sip...maybe that's not the idea. But it did, and I'm not really a spittin' kind of guy.  A love for stinky stuff (beers, cheeses...socks?) helps. As has been said a zillion times before, this style is an acquired taste, but Drie Fonteinen stuff can be counted on to see you through. Enjoyable and unique...I only wish I would've bought at least one more bottle.",0.6250501821082545,3.5,0.9897
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Bourbon Barrel 2010 on tap at the FFF pub after DLD.  A: Thick and black. You could use it to lube up an old engine. Slowly dissipating, tan head. Legs like a supermodel.  S: Nice balance of bourbon, malt sweetness and a little coffee hiding in the background.  T: Wonderful balance of all things awesome. Bourbon most certainly played a supporting role in this one. Far less angular that non-BBA 2010, it doesn't have the eccentric bitter bite that it's little brother has. Nice boozy warmth and plenty of fig, coffee and toffee. Delicious.  M: Thick enough to brush your teeth with. Very low carbonation. The time in the barrel and this being a year old now make it nice and smooth.  O: I'm very impressed with this one. I was lucky enough to be at the brew pub right when they opened the day after DLD. It allowed me to really dissect this one without the craziness of the previous day's festivities surrounding me.  If you're ever in a situation in which you can try this guy out, take advantage of it. This was magical beer.",0.6322315779148326,4.5,0.9897
Schaerbeekse Kriek,Huge thanks to Andy for sharing this one with me! Poured into a chalice. Bright deep red on this one with no head. Some tiny bubbles shoot up the body of this one.  Pretty straight forward aroma here. Nice tart cherry aroma here with a nice cellar must to it. Really a well done balance of tart and sweet here. Mellow cherry flavors with a sweet flavor and tart finish. Really dry cherry skin flavor with a bit of vanilla and oak.  The feel is this is great. Perfectly light body with soft carbonation. When it comes down ot it I really wonder if it gets better than this. A real treat here.,0.6825021636934083,5.0,0.9896
Sang Noir,"Beer pours a dark and deep brown color with a nice off white/tan head. Bubbles surge to the top of the beer and replenish the lovely head.  Aroma is wonderful, light sourness, lactic acid, cherries, currant, malt, and a sublte sweetness.  Flavor is wonderful, slight sweetness, malt, cherries, red fruits. Nice sour and smooth finish.  Medium in body.  Overall a very nice treat. Sourness is perfect. Not over done at all. All the flavors blend together just perfectly.",0.7006169466489856,4.5,0.9896
Oude Geuze Vintage,"April 12, 2002 Vintage. Poured from a 750ml Thanks to Jason. Aroma wicks forth with a flicking tongue of spring essence in a cherry orchard. Blossoms all around. Cottony wafts, sugars flaunt and a wheat essence plays with persimmon seeds and Passionfruit juice in a soft balance. Fleeting ginger. Pours that clear even gold, headed with mountains of residing billowy foam, lubricious in its delivery. Bubbly and alive. Flavor arrives in resplendent glory, with gentle tannins, refined sweetness and lots of elegant cotton. Pear juice and lemon oils. Tart, puckering and full of the necessary farm yard. This was tasted side by side with the standard Oude Geuze and this was hands down the winner. This maintains complex acidity and brightness, yet holds such refined softness and gentle, pleasing flavors. The young has cheese, wildness, wood and acid, this restrains those a little bit and yields soft spice, grassy fields and sunlight. Awesome stuff.",0.6939866537539854,4.5,0.9896
Black Tuesday,"A. Very dark brown, some hues at the edges. Thinner than expected and not jet-ass black. A little head develops but retreats to a fine bubble, amber film.  S. I let this warm and at first the booze comes out - similar to wafting a bourbon - so I suggest wafting this. Lets be honest, this piece is almost 20% so it's in a different category. The dominate notes are dark malts and bourbon-soaked charred oak, then you get coco, coffee, and oats. A little vanilla.  T. Here we go. Chocolaty dark malts, bourbon, bourbon-soaked oak, dried fruits (raisins, figs, plums), and coco. This is not hot - for some reason, but the booze is at the end of the palette, not harsh or unpleasant. Kind of straight forward.   M. Low to moderate carbonation. A littler harsh as one gets to the end of the glass. Full body.  O. I was very excited to trey this and I'm a fan. I have high regards of the Bruery and I think their HIGH-gravity stouts are truly world class. This is a staple of their collection and I'm all about popping the others. Based on how big this beer is, I c=recommend sharing it with some friends. Well crafted. When the time is right, I will crack open my other.",0.6348885332515772,4.5,0.9896
Swish,"Had on tap at the brewery, also got to bring home a few cans. It has a very light yellow hazy color, but big frothy head with a nice aroma of crisp pine and citrus. The mouthfeel is light and bitter in the best kindof way. There is big flavor here of classic New England IPA pine and grapefruit/orange citrus and this beer goes down smooth. It feels like you could drink 10 of these and not feel full. I don't really know the best way to describe this beer except that it's a carnival for your tastebuds but its light weight and bitterness never make you're stomach feel full... Dangerous, if you could only get your hands on more.  This beer has placed itself among the best IPAs in New England. I consider it easily on par with Heady Topper, Sip of Sunshine, and Julius.(My favorite NE IPAs) It's just that good.   If you're headed to Maine, there are a number of wonderful beers to be drank, but this just might be the cream of the crop.",0.6494795160344619,4.75,0.9896
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Even pouring slower than I have ever poured a beer, over two fingers worth of white very dense crown formed. And it stays around. Was not expecting that. The beer itself is a straw/golden color. On the clear side, but not perfectly clear.  Now the smell, is beautiful. Bananas are huge. Smells like banana pudding.  The taste is much of the same. It's a lot like banana pudding. The bananas are huge and it has such a nice sweetness to it. Almost like vanilla wafers.  The feeling coats your mouth with the flavor and stays. Sticky.  Overall, it is a great beer. The only thing I can say bad about it is I would like to be able to not be so careful pouring and have to so slow. But that's minor compared to the flavor and smells this beer gives.",0.6425085631566334,4.25,0.9896
Aaron,"4 oz. onsite, ""2015 Aaron""  Nice deep maple-syrup color in the glass, small ring of foam clings where the liquid meets the edge of the glass.   Nose isn't huge but I'm getting primarily caramel/burnt sugar, dark stone fruits, something resembling maple syrup, but couldn't find the bourbon.  Each sip starts with toffee, rock candy, sweet syrup, ending on something I wanna say is almost like black tea, with a little smidge of alcohol to cut through the sweetness. Again to my surprise not much in the way of bourbon, but I honestly think it was better for that.   Little carb, sticky and coats the tongue but nothing big or overwhelming, and sweetness is always pleasant and never cloying.  Overall can't think of a single better barleywine I've had. Held in especially high contrast against a very bitter/medicinal/cough syrupy barleywine I'd picked up from a bottle shop the day before. Finishing this pour only renewed my efforts to try to land a bottle, definitely don't pass this one up if one comes your way.",0.6334162029489602,4.75,0.9895
Double Orange Starfish,"Another thanks to Drew. No can date.  Pours a decent foamy bubbly almost fluffy 1/2 finger head that fades at a med to slower pace, nice lacing, again super murky milk-shake burnt orange color  Nose is doubly focused on citrus, loads of orange juice and pineapple, a little mango, a bit of sweeter tangerine, pithy, very fruity, a little fruity cereal like fruity pebbles, bit of peachy apricot stone fruit  Taste brings some toasted grainy malts, cereal with more fruity pebbles again, plenty of orange and citrus blended with very creamy almost lactose like flavors, loads of pith and orange juice pulp, some mango and pineapple, a bit more generic tropical and generic citrus, big sweet malt in the background, not quite syrupy but almost there, and touch of alcohol warmth, hops get a little spicy and chewy later, and more like candied orange, sticky finish too.  Mouth is med to a bit heavier bod, touch of warming alcohol, a bit syrupy and thick like, nice fluffy carb  Overall not bad, I like the regular a lot more, this was good but seemed like it was over doing it in almost every aspect and you lost all the nice characters of everything.",0.6726987142852001,4.25,0.9895
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Pours a deep black with a head that disappears fairly quickly and has a foam that circles around the glass but nothing in the middle. The smell is very sweet. Vanilla, almond, roasted pecans, coffee, and dark chocolate. The taste is even better! The bourbon and honey comes through right away along with brown sugar, more roasted nuts, and chocolate. Also a lingering vanilla flavor makes this one quite sweet which is just fine by me. It is an incredibly smooth beer and has one of the best feels, easily up there with the other world class barrel aged stouts that I've had. Overall it's a special beer and is definitely not worth 30 dollars but for a special occasion this fits the bill perfectly.",0.6525231497385022,4.5,0.9895
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"This was served in a chalice-tulip. I reviewed this from notes.   Appearance- The foam is a brown-sugar colored ring around the glass that leaves behind no lace. A completely black body looks great in the curvy glass.  Smell- First noticeable aspect is the iced mocha scent. It is slowly followed by some brown sugar and caramel syrup. I also get the flare of whiskey and oak. It smells incredibly rich and delectable.  Taste- So much whiskey and barrel oozing on the palate, with some coffee roast and leather as it flows over the tongue. The finish is very roasty and smokey.It takes a few sips, but the malt sugar also pervades the drink. Crazy good!  Mouth feel- The pub calls it ""gluttonous"", and I have to agree. The body is huge, silky, and chewy. Thanks to the stickiness, the finish never seems to end.   Overall- Kentucky Brunch is the stuff dreams are made of. This offering would be perfect if the palate imitated the syrupy nose more directly. Instead of letting the smokey whiskey take over on the tongue.   A fantastic, big brew with a fantastic feel and whiskey to spare.",0.641975700723633,4.5,0.9895
Haze,"Fresh can from the brewery. Super excited to get this on the random day I was heading to TH. I was surprised how similar this is to Julius. Pours a very hazy pale orange like watered down orange juice. Medium head that has very good retention and tons of lace sticking everywhere. Unlike some murky NE IPAs, this remains bright despite being super hazy. Nose is slightly bigger than Julius, but still didn't quite match what I expected based on what I'd previously heard. Nice orange zest, some tropical notes, and certainly yeastier than I expected. Taste is a little bolder with durian being the main fruit I get. Plenty of citrus and again that yeasty note. Mouthfeel is really pleasant and soft while still popping on the tongue like citrus pop rocks. Overall, a great beer that didn't quite match the hype but was still a great experience.",0.6722081927278978,4.25,0.9895
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"750ml bottle, 2009 label, poured into an Echt Kriekenbier glass.   Pours a lovely raspberry red color, tones of purple and garnet, slightly hazy with a nice, thick, billowy pink head that has decent retention and leaves a touch of spotted lacing behind. The aroma is of fresh, fleshy, pungent raspberry, funk, light chewy oak and touches of vanilla. The flavors are right in line with the nose. Lots of freshly squeezed raspberry, oak, funk, light acidic vinegar, touches of sweet vanilla at the end. The body is great, it's juicy, thick, almost pulpy with a nice zippy level of carbonation that is very lively on the tongue with a great creamy finish.  Verdict: Spectacular fruited lambic from Cantillon and my personal favorite of the Lou Pepe beers. The raspberry is just so fresh and juicy and doesn't really need any support from other flavors to make this a spectacular beer, a great celebration of raspberry.",0.6830277752852628,4.5,0.9895
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"375 ml bottle into snifter, 2017 vintage bottling. Pours opaque dark brown/black color with a small fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin spotty lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, maple syrup, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, fudge, marshmallow, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, and dark/brown bread; with light notes of coconut, coffee, molasses, licorice, raisin, plum, fig, cherry, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Touch of booze in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, maple syrup, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, maple syrup, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, fudge, marshmallow, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, and dark/brown bread; with light notes of coconut, coffee, molasses, licorice, raisin, plum, fig, cherry, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Mild herbal, roast, char bitterness; and bourbon/oak tannin spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, maple syrup, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, fudge, marshmallow, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, dark/brown bread, light dark fruit/smoke/char, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, maple syrup, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a solid roast/hop bitter/sweet, and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with no cloying/acrid flavors after the finish. Slightly increasing dryness from lingering hop/char bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety, and lightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is fantastic. Mildly increasing warmth of 12.1%, with minimal barrel booze lingering after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic BBA imperial porter! All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, maple syrup, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to drip on for the big ABV, with the mildly bitter/tannic/drying finish. Amazingly rich/well rounded malt complexity and maple syrup presence; with perfect barrel integration/balance. Not overly roasty/charred on malts, or boozy on barrels. A highly enjoyable offering, and spot on style example as expected.",0.6627527218317157,4.0,0.9895
Beatification,"Poured into a tulip. Batch #5, bottled on 01/10/12.  3.0 A: Very faintly hazed concentrated urine color. Two and a half fingers of frothy white head. Retention is average at best and no lacing is left.  4.0 S: Pears, pears, and more pears. This is the peariest beer I've ever smelled. Hay is the next most aggressive note. Moderately tart with more of the wild qualities being of the funk variety. Musty basement, dry-rotten sweatsocks, rotting wood, and dusty old barn. Lemon, vanilla, and oak to round this off. It's complex, but the aromas don't run very deep, if that makes any sense.   4.5 T: Pears dominate the taste as well and it tastes great. Much more tart and acetic than the nose. Plenty of lemon and tart white grape with some lime underneath. The funk mentioned in the nose follows. The taste is both complex and deep. It's potent, yet quite refined. After having a bunch of Bruery sours lately, the quality of this one is that much more apparent. Although this is good and tart, it's still nicely balanced.  4.0 M: Lighter medium body. Higher, but normal range, carbonation with a dry champagne-like spritziness as opposed to a sweet creaminess. Good here.  5.0 D: A couple categories were borderline with a higher score, so hence a 5.0 here. This is the first RR sour that has truly impressed me since I first had Tempation. Solid all around.",0.7068633792278256,5.0,0.9895
Haze,Poured from a 16 oz can into a Aslin Beer Co stemmed glass. Canned 11-20-2016.   Appear: poured beautiful orange juice haze with a about a fingers worth of foam that disapiated pretty quickly. gorgeous lacing is left along as you rock the glass.   Smell: Holy Orange Juice rolls into stone fruit and topical notes some peaches and magoes great herbal and earthy dankness. there's also some candied orange rind going which is nice.   Taste: orange creamsicle on the palate. delicious piney sappy notes on the finish. There's also some of the same mango and tropical fruit notes you get on the nose. The pithy piney notes do build as you sip but not in a bad way. It actually makes the beer more balanced.   Mouth: some silky and so smooth. medium feel. I don't know that it can get any better.   Over: Delicious reminds me of Pineal by Tired Hands. Great drinking experience. 8.2% where it's hidden. Could be 4.2% for what I could tell. Very well balanced between the great silky juicy notes and the sappy bitter notes. Great brew. RIght up my ally.,0.6769989068477102,4.5,0.9895
Beatification,"Check in/ Review #1000, figured I would pull this baby out for the occasion.   Batch #006, bottle date of 9/11/2013, poured into Perennial Societe Du Chene stem.  L: Pours semi-translucent yellow...about the same color as the label. No foam, no lacing, close to zero carbonation. (3.00)  S: Straight up funk, lemongrass, slight vinegar, tropical fruits, stone fruits. Wonderful (4.75)  T: As with the smell, acidy, vinegary, unripe peaches, lemon zest, a bit of gueuze-esqe barnyardyness. Pretty damn good, but I wish the bottle had some carbonation to liven up the flavor on my taste buds. Also could use just a touch more (4.5)  F: Pretty good, but again its almost flat and doesn't really have much going on here.(4.0)  O: While extremely tasty, and without a doubt the best RR wild ale I have had to date, this one did not live up to my expectations. I feel like years ago, this might have been the pinnacle of American sours, but now a days it takes much more than this to be mentioned in the best of the best. (4.25)",0.6240563945724886,4.25,0.9895
Chocolate Rain,"2013 vintage  It poured surprisingly thin compared to what I've been accustomed to with Briery releases. It's still thick, but not motor oil thick. There's also a little light that passes through it, giving it a dark brown appearance.   Aroma is dessert in a glass. Fudge brownies and vanilla bean.   This one met my high expectations. It's sweet and chocolatey. Boozey, but at 18% not as bad as I'd expect. I'm thrilled that it's not cloyingly sweet like a lot of these Bruery releases are. It seriously tastes like a fudge brownie a la mode. So good.   It's thicker than it appears. Soft, good carbonation. Boozey and a sipper. Sweet through and through.   I'm glad this also lived up to the hype. I've been dying to try this one for years and was not disappointed.",0.6345559916141721,4.5,0.9895
Sure Bet,"Serving: 22 oz. bomber poured into a tulip. This is batch 573 bottled 11/30/14, making this just over 2 weeks old.   A: Pours a very cloudy, murky, soft orange color with a creamy 1/2 finger white head. Not a very appealing beer at first sight. Looks like grapefruit juice.   S: Alright, now we're talking. Big, fresh-squeezed mangos. There's also quite a splash of grapefruit aroma, likely from the hops. No detectable honey in the nose.   T: Big, tangy grapefruit and tangerine notes up front. Surprisingly, mango not my first thought in the flavor, it's more in the aftertaste. Finishes strong with mango puree flavor, almost like a smoothie. Very sweet and juicy.   M: Big, full mouthfeel for a DIPA. The mango puree and honey really smoothen this beer out and make it go down like mango juice or a smoothie. Very acidic, too.  O: So, compared directly to Square Grouper, I do not think this beer is an improvement. The mango puree addition sounds nice in theory, but just doesn't nail it in practice with this one. It makes it too sweet, too acidic, and takes away from the robust hoppyness and crispness of the original. However, this is still a really good DIPA, and right up there with the other great PW DIPAs like Citra and Rock Bottom. It's just not as good as SG.   Recommendation: Grab one if you can find it.",0.6616689449201382,4.25,0.9894
Darkstar November,"Thanks to mjytown08 for this 500ML bottle, which I am going to take downtown with one swing of the new Mizuno tonight. I mean, rye, molasses, barrel, stout? There’s only so erect I can get.   Black. Nose is sweet loving molasses, vanilla, bourbon, with a speckle or two of whale & chocolate. Nice start.   Darkstar November hits me right in the left feels. Huge sweet malts wrap its legs around the rye, & there’s enough sweetness from the molasses to make me think I’m wriggling around inside a maple tree’s wet dream. Barrel arrives only slowly, but there is bourbon, vanilla in the mid-section. Rounding out this drama are bits of chocolate, pepper. Alcohol is amazingly well concealed in the taste, if not the slow warping of my brain. Yes, I can feel that. Yes, I am on my couch. Yes, I can still stand up. Thick, viscous, & so sippable. Happy to have this mid-size bottle all to myself. Fuck sharing!  This is what I thought I was getting with its kissing cousin Fundamental Observation - which is a great beer, but Darkstar gets enough experience points for another level (or maybe two!). Holy shit this is spectacular. Wake me when the 13.8% wears off.",0.5993879357456855,5.0,0.9894
Green,"Aside from the slightly muted yet amazing aroma, I would say this is a perfect beer. It literally tastes like it’s something from a higher being. It has aspects of fresh squeezed pineapple juice along with hints of super fresh crackers that one would find on a cheese plate. There is an amazing dank green smell and taste from the hops that is so smooth and subtle. Trying to explain this is hard so here is my way of describing the taste: When other people hype up tree house and trillium and say things like, “It is pillow soft like silk in your mouth” ... they are right. There is no true way of describing this beer without trying it or something comparable to it. I expected an explosion of flavor and got more of a perfectly balanced drink instead that was so smooth and soft. Almost want more explosion hence the not perfect score, but far and away the best beer(not just IPA) I have EVER had. Now keep in mind this was my first tree house beer and I have not tried bissell or trillium so I may be a little spoiled at the moment. I did face this off against Foggy Window from Monkish. Both A+ beers but Green wins due to that amazing soft bubblegum/bread yeast backbone it has. Also the monkish foggy window was more west coast IPA in terms of bitterness. I like the smooth crushable nature of the east coast IPAs. I am saying this as a long time beer drinker... the hype is real. Nate at tree house has mastered something that I thought was not possible. He’s made beer taste better than a fufu coconut mixed drink in the Caribbean. I kind of want to toss the other 40 beers in my fridge because they will never measure up... For instance, I had some FNG by Ellipsis brewing out of Orlando where I live which is a 4.1 on untappd... it was flat and gross in comparison. Drinker beware, you try this and you may not like other IPAs after.",0.6451363668716454,5.0,0.9894
Beatification,"375 ml bottle, bottled 01/10/12 from batch 5, poured into a snifter. Major thanks to Eli for opening this.  A- Pours a clear golden color, topped with a thin white head, nice retention and some spotty lacing.  S- Some fruitiness, mostly lemon and maybe some apple and white grape, huge, huge lactic and acetic tartness, some funkiness and a lot of oak.  T- Massive, massive acidity. Really insanely, over-the-top sourness. This has gotta be one of the sourest beers I've ever had, but its acidity is nicely balanced, so it totally avoids that pure vinegar flavor that a lot of very sour beers fall into. There are also some nice fruity flavors of lemon, white grape and apple, along with some oak and funk.  M- Medium-bodied, nice carbonation, has a very dry, puckering feel.  O- One of my new favorite sours, the tartness dominates everything but is soooo good. Absolutely great beer and amongst the best I've had from Russian River.",0.6751629149707399,4.75,0.9894
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Had a chance to try this the Tuesday after DLD in an empty FFF brewpub so I had a chance to write a proper review. Served in a stemless goblet that looked like a rounded old fashioned glass.  A - Black as anything. Super dark and absolutely no light can get through this one. Nice and thick as well as they body just coats the glass. There was a bit of a mocha colored head when it came out but as with any beer with this much head, it had no chance at all of surviving. Have to say it managed to leave a few bubbles on the surface that reminded me a bit of a black swamp that one would see in a horror movie. Have to say this did leave a lot of lacing for a beer that barely had any head as the whole little glass was spotted with lacing.  S - A huge nose that is filled with odors of vanilla, caramel, and toffee. Definitely can tell the effects of the BA as I could smell the cinnamon and whiskey spices even from far away. I was surprised to notice that I actually smelled some cherry and plum/prune dark fruits odors in there as well that gave this beer some added complexity.  T - Yikes, this is one beer that manages to be both flavor packed and yet subdued and balanced. At first, i get a big sweet, vanilla, toffee, and caramel flavors that roll in. After this and towards the end of the beer is when I start to notice how those spicy Woodford reserve barrels have affected this beer. Can just taste the effects of the oak and the spicy cinnamon and pepper it imparts. Also seemed to get a hint of cherry and plum in the beer as well as roasted cocoa and chocolate. Have to love having all that in there together.  MF - Just a bit thinner than I like my RIS's to feel. It does have really nice prickly feeling on the tongue that goes well with all of the spiciness that we find as a result of the oak aging.   D - Lets just say that this is a 13% huge stout and yet I have no trouble at all drinking the whole glass. This is a beer that just makes you want to have more of it. It is complex and flavor packed and I never felt overwhelmed or tired of drinking it. Each sip brought a new experience to me. Love that I got a chance to actually sit down and try it in an experience other than DLD because it let me really appreciate all that it is.",0.6272015649565262,5.0,0.9894
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"(From notes)  A - Ruby reddish color; poured with a very thin white head  S - Fruity tartness; fresh raspberries; hint of cherry; bit of vinegar; then again with the raspberry finish  T - Beautifully tart; fresh raspberries and wild strawberry flavors; light on the vinegar but definitely present; mild funkiness as well. Really nice  M - Thinner; effervescent carbonation  D - Really awesome for the style; refreshing and interesting but didn't wear thin and wasn't prohibitively sour  Overall, a great example of the style and a wonderful brew.",0.6924091649939285,4.5,0.9894
Beatification,"Big thanks to Nanobrew and FosterJM for this one!  A: Slight pop when the cork came off. Pours a hazy golden orange with a nice white, fizzy head on top. Pretty good retention with sporadic lacing that doesn't last too long.   S: Fantastic tartness. Some peach, lemon, apricot, and white grapes. Nice citrus fruits and some nice barnyard funk that blends nicely with the fruit/tartness.   T: Has a very gueuze like flavor, lots of tart lemon and some apricot. Underneath there is some tart green apple and more white grapes. Very mouth puckering and it is amazing.   M: Medium bodied, great level of carbonation. Very tart/acidic, but I am really liking it.   O: Simply put, amazing. One of the best beers I have ever had hands down. Great flavor and extremely tart.",0.6744624959273638,5.0,0.9894
Peche 'n Brett,"The beer pours a honey amber color with excellent head retention and considerable laciing. On the nose, this beer really smells terrific. You definitely get a lot of peach (canned and fresh), but there's also some noticeable fruit cocktail, a hint of vanilla, and sort of a ""bretty"" buttery funk aroma. The beer doesn't smell as if it's going to be all that sour, and in fact it wasn't. Otherwise, the flavor profile replicated the nose, but the balance in this beer is nothing short of amazing. There is a hint of sour, but it's just enough to counter the modest sweetness in this beer. Drinkability is just off the charts. Each sip begs for another one, and before I even knew what I was doing, I found myself reaching for the bottle to pour myself another glass. Alcohol is incredibly well integrated into the flavor profile. I did a double take when I saw the 10%.... there is no way I would have guess it was that high. Mouthfeel is fairly full with a long, lightly sour peach finish. However, there is nothing at all heavy or tiring about this beer on the palate, and this beer is just a joy to drink.  Excellent stuff.... even the usual out of the way places in town where I can usually find hard to find beers (MofC on Terwilliger and in West Linn, for example) were sold out of this beer, even though I'm sure they just got their supply in this past week. After trying this beer, I now have a better understanding why.  Edit from 4/12/14. As others have noted, this is not a beer to age or sit on. Sampled one of two bottles I still have left from the most recent release, and the peach flavor is already starting to subside a bit. It was stil tasty, but when very fresh, the peach flavor is prominent and just amazing, whereas now it's just one more voice in the flavor profile chorus. Still good, don't get me wrong, but when very fresh, this beer is just out of this world.",0.6615048255851435,4.5,0.9893
Society & Solitude #4,"First tried a sample of this at Drink Craft Beer's Summerfest last night in Sommerville. This review is from a 750ml growler filled at the bottle release earlier today. Poured into Hill Farmstead glass.  A- Pours a hazy opaque yellowish orange with a finger of nice fluffy white head that slowly recedes. About average carbonation. Leaves nice layered lacing.  S- A nice aroma of citrus hops and tropical fruits of lemons, oranges, grapefruit, papaya balanced with some subtle spices and some faint booze in the background. Definitely above average aroma strength, hit with the smell while pouring from the growler.  T- Oranges, a little bit of lemons, grapefruit, some light spices. Finishes with a semi-sweet citrusy fruit flavor that lingers for awhile. Definitely not that bitter.  M- Medium bodied, very well balanced, high drinkability, goes down very smoothly, average carbonation, has a very nice full-bodied well-balanced feel for a DIPA.  O- This was another awesome beer from Hill Farmstead, right up there with the rest of them. Very nice balance between citrus fruits and spices and having a very high drinkability without being overly bitter or citrusy. Drinks much lighter then a 8% abv beer. Unfortunately Double Citra kicked before I got the chance to try it, would have loved to compare the two. Wish I could get weekly growler fills of this!",0.6801280454647853,4.5,0.9893
Fort Point Pale Ale,"tulip on tap at TRB.  A: Super cloudy orange juice color with a soft, greasy, white head. The color is more of a glowing, brighter, orange than it is a muddy yellow orange.  S: Sweet tropical fruit scents along with hints of melon. Fruity and clean smelling. No bitterness on the nose, but I get hints of mild grapefruit pith.  T: Sweet tropical fruit follows the nose with notes of tangerine and papaya. Juicy perfumey hops; kiss of pale bready malt. Bitterness is lightly herbal but fairly easy on the palate. M: Very soft and smooth medium-full body with creamy carbonation and a well-rounded soft feel overall. Slight spritzy tingly fresh hop oils, moderate bitterness that is cut by the sweet fruity quality. Surprisingly fairly drying finish. Not the wettest cloudy APA I've had, which is great to me. O: A delicious beer. I've had clear beers that have taste and smell similar to this, but the carbonation in this is more soft and creamy. Thankfully, the mouthfeel is still drying and not overly muddled feeling. Delicious.",0.6989092964825692,4.5,0.9893
Green,"3rd favorite TH beer to date, behind Haze then Very Hazy.  L: Super hazy. Looks like murky pineapple juice. Wonderful thick head.  S: Very, very tropical. Like Dole tropical fruit juice. As it warms up, it has this interesting spice like quality that I get out of saisons. It's very unique and good, but I think for me it just holds it back from being perfect.  T: Exact same as the smell.   O: Fantastic IPA, one of the best I've had. Like I mentioned, the only thing holding it back from 5's across the board is that spicy, saison like quality. Kind of resembles clove or hay.  I just want to mention that TH beers, while very intense in their own way, have this subtleness to them that doesn't make the beer overpowering. It's different, but makes the beers so incredibly drinkable.",0.643790756870107,4.5,0.9893
Society & Solitude #4,"Hazy orange color with a nice bright white head. Aroma is fairly tropical with notes of mango and pineapple alongside a healthy dose of citrus zest. A light amount of malt notes in there as well.   Citrus notes dominate the palate with a nice array of grapefruit and orange. Bitterness is there to give a little kick but does not abuse your tastebuds like many DIPAs do. Finding this to be rather sweet with just enough malt backbone to help round things out.   Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice lively carbonation. Overall, S&S #4 truly is a top notch DIPA that really shows how some of these newer hops like citra can be used.",0.7204842787114667,4.5,0.9893
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"A huge thanks goes out to an unnamed BA who helped me out with this one. Quite possibly the biggest think on my bucket list of beers. I have been waiting far too long to try this one. Served chilled and poured into a pint glass.  The pour was black as night. Small head of tan faded quickly leaving behind only the slightest bit of brown clinging to the sides of the glass. Seriously black as night on the pour here though with an intensly dark look to it. The aroma was wonderful. Tons of oak notes here hit you first with the sweet molasses and tobacco notes following up nicely. Smooth, subtle and wonderfully complex flavor here. Not the harsh oak, I found this to be very close in flavor to the 03 BA speedway, mature would be the best word for how it tasted. Really very well done. Very sweet tasting, especially on the finish here with notable light vanilla touches that mingled well with the oak notes and really full feel on this one, about as thick and creamy as a beer can get. Alcohol noted, but not overwhelming.  Overall this was soo worth the wait for me. A wonderfully complex beer that was accented perfectly. A different beast the the DL itself, this is something I would love to see come around much more often.",0.6550458133020053,5.0,0.9893
Beatification,"Got this beer in a ridiculously generous box from Huadog in the sour BIF. Batch 004. The beer has a short white head with really nice retention and some very nice sheets of lacing. Mildly cloudy golden color. Aroma is very bretty, barnyard, lots of lemon and lemon zest, floral notes, and more horsey notes than I have noticed in pretty much any other beer. Flavor has a nice bitter, funky, horsey, lemon character. There is a bit of sweetness and a lot of clean tartness. Some of the acetic sourness reminds me a bit of consecration in a great way. Quite gueuze like. Mouthfeel is light, dry, great carbonation, very nice beer. I was expecting a ton from russian river and they delivered for me. Great sour.  Thanks again huadog.",0.6710401592073554,4.5,0.9892
Chocolate Rain,"2014 bottle from yesterday's share.  Talk about a beer that looks like a booze! Pouring this beer is like pouring a whiskey, just like Mocha Wednesday, Black Tuesday, and Grey Monday were. There was almost no head to speak of after the beer was poured and the only lacing was just the legs from the alcohol content. In the glass, the beer is almost black. On the nose, there is an assault of big, sweet, and boozy characteristics. There was a ton of brown sugar sweetness and little bit of chocolate, both of which were mostly dominated by a strong alcohol scent of whiskey and barrel. When the first sip hits the tongue, the alcohol is instantly noticeable burn. The rest of the drink is a sweet combination of vanilla, oak, chocolate, and just a touch of marshmallow. At the back end of the drink, the chocolate kicks in again a little stronger and is quickly accompanied by the alcohol flavor and burn that is the lingering characteristic. Mouthfeel on this one is more like a liqueur than a beer, with hardly any carbonation and a sticky, boozy, warming sensation as it goes down.  Overall, this was in line with its brethren in the days of the week series; big, boozy, sweet, and a little overrated. The beer itself it more of a novelty than a normal beer, and it drinks like a sweet, strong liqueur. Take this down with a few friends, otherwise, you'll be lucky to remember anything about this beer.",0.5925938896697995,4.25,0.9892
Oude Geuze Vintage,"A - A clear orangish gold color, not a ton of head. No cap or ring, and left the sides of the glass clean.  S - Tannic, sour, tart. Nice and funky, but not quite as barnyard as the Blauw. It does somehow smell pretty smooth.  T - This is very good. Smooth, a bit tangy, funky but not too funky. Nice lemon peel that manages to be not too citrus. Drank Blauw right before this, it is not as good, but is not far off.  M - Smooth, finishes very dry, little bit of bite.  D - Pretty easy to do, this is a great beer, would recommend to anone.",0.6757408423981912,4.0,0.9892
Juicy,"Thanks to MEW for this one!  Poured into new belgian globe from 350 bottle, be careful, mine was a gusher.  a- poured a beautiful hazy golden peach, about a half inch of clean white head. I haven't seen a beer quite this color before. Nice lacing as well.  s- lots of citrus on the nose, lots of brett tartness but without the plastic or band aid smells some people associate with brett. Some hops come through as well, but the brett makes my mouth water, so on with the show...  t- first sip, holy cow, reminds me of biting into a fresh grapefruit. Lots of bright citrus tartness with the hops balancing things out well. I can't decide if I should sip and savor this or chug this right now! Amazing flavors, I can't get enough.   m- silky smooth mouthfeel, the head adds a velvet like feel to the tart flavors. Exactly what I expected.  o- this has been the best brett saison I have had. Ever. Top five beers of all time for me thus far.",0.6504945004658388,5.0,0.9892
Black Tuesday,"I'm pretty sure this was a 2012 bottle, consumed Jan. '14. Dark brown-black pour, no surprise there, topped with a thin brown head that receded to a ringlet; minimal lacing. Aroma was fairly sweet, notes of dark chocolate and vanilla, pretty hot with bourbony booze, licorice, brown sugar, some dark fruits. But the booze was the dominant factor. Fairly sweet up front in the taste (not quite Dark Lord sweet, perhaps), lots of booze, bourbon-soaked oak, bitter dark chocolate, licorice, tobacco, dark fruits, more subtle vanilla, the oak and herbal hops came out a bit more in the finish, and even more so as it warmed. While this was definitely pretty hot and boozy, it still drank fairly well, considering the extremely high ABV. Body was on the fuller side of medium--might as well just call it full--with a slick and somewhat unctuous mouthfeel. A decent brew overall, but doesn't really live up to the hype (welcome to the Bruery). I can get a World Wide Stout at my local shop and experience pretty much the same thing this beer offers (or better), in a better package (aka smaller bottle) and for a better price.",0.6695292185086733,3.75,0.9892
Sip Of Sunshine,"Wow, love this beer.just happened to be at Cambridge wine and spirits (one of my favorite stores) when I found this. I have had it and loved it before. It was served in a frozen glass. Perfect. Such a nice head, though short lived, nice color. The aroma was very pleasing. It hits with nice citrus and hoppy flavor on the tip of your tongue and and then you get a light hops flavor on the back of your tongue. Nice pleasing lingering light hoppy flavor.

It smells like you're opening up a can of dole cut pineapples. Nice hop aromas around the edges of the fruit-splosion. Just smells super fruity. Crazy. Taste is a really nice mix of pineapple, papaya, nice very slightly sweet malt, enriching and balanced hops. Feel is very nice, rich, smooth, perfect carbonation.

Mastermind,"Poured from a 12 ounce can into a tulip. This was canned on 10/2/14 (date stamped on bottom of can), so 12 days ago.  Appearance: Pours a just slightly hazy light amber/gold color with a yellow hue. A couple fingers of quite light and fluffy, white head remain and slowly fade to a white layer atop the beer, leaving full lacing down the glass. (4.5)  Smell: Big tangerine, fresh oranges, floral hops, a dash of honey, a hint of earthy tones. That orange flavor is just huge - much larger than in any beer I've experienced. Lovely, unique aroma. (4.75)  Taste: That huge orange once again, like eating a segment straight from the fruit, earthy notes, hint of resin, floral hops, light biscuity malts. Finishes a little watery which is interesting. This drinks like a very light IPA, but with huge flavor. (4.5)  Mouth-feel: Medium to well carbonated with a light to medium body. Finishes really smooth and light. (4.5)  Overall: What an interesting IPA. Very interesting and delicious fresh orange flavors dominate, but are complimented by earthy and floral notes, along with some biscuit/cracker characteristics. So light for a DIPA - truly a unique beer.",0.6915722139826199,4.25,0.9891
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2006 sticker date, 2008 cork date. Thanks to Jim for this one, been waiting for a while to run across a bottle.  Pours a murky red/plum/pink color with a finger of light pink head that camps out for a while.  When agitated, a fresh raspberry aroma invades the nose and gives an absolutely amazing feeling that is hard to describe...if I close my eyes it is like I'm running through a garden complete with fresh fruit, dirt, grass, morning dew. Just incredible.  The flavor can't live up to the aroma but I'll be damned if it isn't spectacular anyway. Lots of dirt and stanky cheese underneath a blanket of raspberry, strawberry, and grape fruitiness. There is a sour bite that is magnified exponentially if you swish the beer around your mouth a bit before swallowing. I almost accidentally spit beer all over my keyboard because it hit a sweet spot on my tongue and made me pucker like crazy.   The finish is very long and full of raspberry. The body is medium and carbonation seems lower on the tongue than my eyes woud lead me to believe. Very juicy up front but a dry finish.  Overall this is an absolutely stunning, world class beer. Supremely balanced with a nice level of sourness that satisfies my craving without giving me rot gut. Huge fruitiness despite sitting 2 years in the bottle. Like with most Cantillons, a 750ML bottle needs to be split at least 2 ways so I really wish this one was available in 375's. Oh well. A beer this special needs a friend to share it with anyway.",0.6368630505016621,5.0,0.989
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"Bourbon Barrel Black Maple pours a very deep brown and sports a light brown head of foam. The head dissipates fairly quickly. The beer smells quite good - it's certainly sweet, per the nose, but also has a bit of booziness.   While cold, the beer has a slightly dry mouth feel. The barrel is definitely present. It is, per the smell, very sweet. The maple somehow fails to be all that present in the taste.  As the beer warms, it just gets sweeter. It has a nice bit of heat to it, but the alcohol isn't present in the taste.  As with CBS - I'd expected more of this beer. I like maple, in general and as an adjunct, so the last few maple beers have let me down a bit. Great Notion's Double Stack has been the only one to really impress me thus far.

This beer pours a beautiful hazy golden. The smell is of rich tropical fruits, with a hint of pine.   The taste? Unreal. Beautiful hints of tropical fruit with just a touch of pine, a touch of sweetness, and perfect carbonation. The bitterness is there, but it is very low.... much lower than I am used to for this style, and that is perfect.   I could drink this beer every day for the rest of my life.

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2008 Vintage - Bottled September 29th, 2010 - Green corked and capped bottle, poured into my Cantillon stemware...  Pours a beautiful, glowing deep ruby red. Two fingers of light pink head forms and quickly recedes, leaving me with a glass of Hawaiian Punch...  Wow, the most intense blast of pure fresh raspberries fills my nose right away. This is the most fruit forward Cantillon I have ever smelled. Literally like sticking your nose straight into a crate of fresh, ripe raspberries. Awesome. The typical Cantillon funk has been pushed to the background, very subtle mustiness and faint oak character, this one is all about the fruit...  Tart and intensely fruity. Lemon acidity followed by extremely tart raspberries. The funk that was mostly absent in the nose comes through stronger in the taste. Musty and dry. Finishes extremely dry with a nice touch of oak.

Black Tuesday,"Big thanks to Tommy for nailing this long time want of mine - it has eluded me for too long! Black Tuesday pours, well... black. Deep black with dark, dark brown only rounding out the corners. No head, no foamy collar, nothing in terms of life except for a few bleak bubbles that rise to the surface and immediately pop; its got legs like a supermodel when you swirl the glass, though.  What a massive aroma; as soon as your nose heads towards the glass, Black Tuesday's aroma reaches out and runs a train on your nostrils. Warm bourbon, smooth caramel, cocoa dust, chocolate malts, mild vanilla, thick brown sugar, molasses, and some heavy back-end black licorice and anise. Pretty sweet and boozy, and at 19.2% ABV, I don't think that's a surprise to anyone.  The taste is every bit as huge as the aroma, and every bit of that 19.2% ABV is felt, as well as matched with enormous malty sweetness. Sugary and sweet up front, rivers of warm caramel, bourbon soaked oak chips, roasty chocolate malts, minimal roast, and sticky molasses. It's just such a gigantic beer; every single sip lingers on your palate long after it has been swallowed. Black Tuesday, straight annihilating your taste buds.  Everything you thought you knew about hot, sweet beer just got wrecked thanks to this malt dragon. The finish is full of more cocoa, caramel, bourbon, oak, as well as some vanilla and licorice sweetness. Warmth, of course, brings out more sweetness, more robustness, and more booze. The mouth feel is monstrous as well; sticky and thick, chewy, oily, large and in charge.  Black Tuesday is a beast of a beer - a true night cap and a sipper if there ever was one. It'll take even the manliest of men a while to pounce through their pours of this one. That said, it's quite tasty and really an enjoyable experience, but you better leave the Motrin on the night stand if you plan on tackling this one alone. Huge, sweet, and boozy; unabashedly so.

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Bottle dated 3187 (May 3, 2017). Hefeweizen glass.  A: pours a turbid yellow-orange (made sure to swirl the yeast) with 1-1.5 fingers of fluffy, bubbly, white head and loads of carbonation blasting away.  S: more banana and clove than the American hefeweizens I've had. This borders on Belgian wit territory, but without the bubblegummy phenolic edge.  T: bready and slightly sour-tangy arrival. Moderate sourdough breadiness on mid palate, closing out to a light bitterness and underripe banana note. Slight wheaty sourdough taste lingers.  M: light and creamy, loads of effervescence.  O: I know this is a 6 month old bottle, but that's par for the course around here. I'd love to try this on draft next time to see how much better it is. As it stands, I agree with the chorus of people who say this is the best hefeweizen around. But as a style I am underwhelmed as compared to witbiers and American wheat ales. This is an understated and quaffable style, and except for rapid distribution, Weihenstephaner has executed it pretty well, as far as I am concerned. Think it would be better fresh. Liked their dunkelweizen more, and Hacker-Pschorr better.",0.666852599658306,4.0,0.9889
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Poured from a 2011 750 mL bottle into a tulip.  There is a soft ’pop’ as the cork is released, and the pour into my glass has an energetic level of carbonation. The beer itself is a hazy dark pink rapsberry color throughout, with a few resplendent bubbles visibly rising from the bottom of glass. A gentle off-white head relaxes to a ring around the edge for most of the glass.  A robust cherry aroma is not overly strong but is definitely the most noticeable aroma. At first the cherries seem sweet and creamy, but there is a slightly sharp tartness that adds a little bit of an edge. Lemony lambic notes, tannic cherry skin, and some oaky red wine notes. As it warms the farmyard funk comes through, although it is not dominant by any means.  The Schaerbeekse cherries come through immediately. Once the fruit base is set, the tartness starts to build, bringing in notes of lemon and oak, and a bit of tannic vinous fruit. The lambic in the form of lactic acidity and the sweet cherries play off of each other for the majority of the sip. Just a bit of Bretty funk adds a background complexity. There is a mineral note in the finish.   As compared to some other fruit lambics, this has a somewhat richer body and creamier nature. The carbonation is smooth and gentle as opposed to crisp, which makes it feel undercarbonated at times. In reality, it is simply more of a subtle carbonation to go along with its subtle flavor. Even though it is tart and sour, I do not sense that it is overly acidic.  I enjoyed drinking this Kriek for sure. My fruit lambic preference goes to Cantillon, but this is a serious lambic.",0.7197043576705611,4.5,0.9889

Black Tuesday,"2015 vintage. Gonna attempt this myself. Starting it off cold right out of the fridge...  A - teku pour. Looks not expected. Super thin looking and dark brown. Certainly not black. Thin, very fizzy head. The lacing looks like a watery 5% stout.   S - ton's of bourbon and raisens. Smells sweet and delicious. Lots of vanilla and toffee. Surprisingly small amount of detectable alcohol given the abv.  T -mmm. Me like. Sweet, sweet bourbon, vanilla, raisens. Literally the exact nose but with a LOT of alcohol burn.  M - it's not thick or chewy but it is highly carbonated. Extremely spicy from the alcohol.  O - I'm digging it. I'll add some more notes as it warms.  Value - a $30 beer is pretty steep. I'll come back to this to say if I think it's worth it or not.  The more this warms the more it tastes like molasses. Also, it tasted very familiar at first but I couldn't put my finger on what beer it reminded me of. About a 1/4 into it abd it hit me. This is eerily similar to Jackie O's bourbon barrel dark apparition + more alcohol burn.  As I'm nearing the end, not a whole lot has changed. It's still a spicy ethanol sugar bomb with all the same aspects present. Overall - it was worth it. I loved slowly sipping this one beer over the long haul as opposed to bouncing around. For a $30 beer, yes I'd spend/trade for again. I'm now excited to try it's variants.",0.6343654280775627,4.75,0.9889
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Lucked into this being on tap at City Beer Store. As I have never seen this in bottles, might be my only chance to try.  The beer pours a bright pink, almost magenta with little to no head. I don't really have a frame of reference as far as how this beer looks relative to other lambics, but the color is very unique.  The nose is brett, some funk and some sweet raspberries to balance things out.  This was a great tasting beer, and very complex. While cold, the raspberries dominate. The funk, a combination of sour and spicy, is more noticeable on the back of the palate. As the beer warms, the fruitiness is less noticeable, and the acidity and sour flavors are more evident. I am not sure if this had more to do with the warming of the beer or whether I was simply less aware of the fruit as I drank the beer. The combination of fruitiness and acidity were ideal.  This is not a beer that I would want to have every day or one I would want to consume in great quantities. I very much enjoyed this - more than I would have anticipated - and am hoping to explore a bit more of this style. Absolutely give this beer a try if you see it.",0.6834335594195308,4.5,0.9888
Black Tuesday,"2015 vintage, poured in a teku glass at approximately 55 degrees.  A: Pours dark brown sugar color, able to see through the pour. In the glass it's black with light around the edges. Dark mocha head initially that fades extremely fast. Swirling revitalizes the head a bit but the carbonation is limited. Very apparent alcohol legs. S: Dark chocolate, oak barrels, faint whiskey, plums, trace amounts of cherry, some vanilla, licorice, dark fruits, cinnamon, nutty aromas of walnuts and almonds. Reminds you somewhat of cinnamon oatmeal packets, a rich bouquet of fruit and spices. Caramelized sugars. It really opens up as it warms. The alcohol is more apparent the warmer it gets, but no astringency or booziness. T: Warm on the tongue right away, it provides a massive payload of sweet caramel, chocolate, bourbon and dark fruit. Just awesome. It really opens up as it gets warmer, providing a really rich experience on the tongue with notes of the various aromas mentioned above. Drinks like a chocolate cake in many ways. Some heat is there, but for such a big ABV beer it is not overly boozy. M: Big mouthfeel. Sits heavy on the tongue but still very drinkable when you consider the alcohol content. Coats the mouth. This is the definition of a sipper beer. Light carbonation is there, but doesn't play a lot into the overall experience. O: just an awesome beer. It's got the full chocolate bourbon barrel experience you expected. Absolutely one of the best beers I've ever had.",0.6709251944836342,4.75,0.9888
Madagascar,"650ml bottle, undated but assumed to be fresh from the 2018 release, poured into a 12oz wine glass.  The beer pours a deep jet black color, thick and viscous with a finger of caramel head, moderate retention that yields some wet lace. The aroma is pleasant, lots of vanilla bean and marshmallow fluff, dark chocolate, fusel alcohol and underlying bourbon character with some nice charred wood, roasted grain and stone fruits. The flavors are very nice, lots of vanilla bean, marshmallow fluff, smooth bourbon, dark chocolate, roasted grain, charred wood, lingering alcohol heat and smooth stone fruits with a bit of caramel and brown sugar. The mouthfeel is very good, thick and viscous, coating with a heavy body and a soft but warm finish.   Verdict: A nice barrel aged adjunct stout from 4 Hands. The vanilla is nicely integrated, not overly cloying and the beer offers some nice depth to balance things out.",0.6760921151367936,4.0,0.9888
Green,"Just. Amazing. All the hype is true. I tried so hard not to let my preconceived notions of this beer sway me - I'd heard all the hype, read some reviews (although I tried to stay away from many of them), know all about the mystique surrounding Tree House Brewing Company. Managed to find a trio of Tree House IPAs online and couldn't save them for a special occasion as I wanted to sample them as fresh as possible. This one was the oldest - canned on 3/27/19 - so it was first up to bat. And oh man was this an amazing NE-style IPA. Clearly the best I've ever had. Looked absolutely outstanding - hazy pale yellow color, layers and layers of pillowy-soft fluffy white head and abundant sheets of lingering lacing that lasted forever. I gave it a 4.75 rating for look, just out of principle of not giving 5s, but I'm not sure how much better a beer could have looked. Smells incredible, loads of fresh citrus juicy fruit - pineapple, orange, tangerine, grapefruit, a little lemon - with some more faint floral hops and malt in the distant background. Taste follows the nose, and that sweeter malt backbone was very restrained and tame. That was good since there wasn't as much of a bitter hoppy hit as I was expecting at the finish. The mouthfeel was out of this world - soft, inviting, pillowy, luscious, slightly sticky. Smooth, creamy and juicy and perfect carbonation balance. Honestly I can't believe this beer had a higher ABV as it was like drinking some sort of luscious juicy summer concoction. Well done, Tree House. Well done.",0.6840716792221807,4.75,0.9888
Nectarine Premiere,"750ml bottle, served in a teku glass.  Pours an extremely hazy light yellow-orange body; it literally looks like fruit juice. One finger white head that dies down fairly quickly. But it's a very beautiful juice-like liquid. Smell is full of nectarines, a bit of oak and funk along with some acetic and lactic acidity, almost one-note, but it's very juicy and fruit-forward to the point of nearly overwhelming anything else in the beer. I did enjoy smelling this beer, especially as it warmed, so I can't dock it too much. On the other hand, it doesn't provide as much of an interesting tasting experience as it did a smelling experience. Plenty of nectarine pulp, a bit of citrus zest, mild acetic acidity, mild oak and funk. Again, it's all mostly fruit. It's not necessarily a bad thing as it tastes like tart nectarine juice, but it could use a bit more complexity to it. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, solid carbonation though a bit lower which is par for the course with De Garde. It's not bitter and brings mild-moderate acidity. Very drinkable. Overall, very fruit-forward wild ale that seems to overwhelm some of the other components. That being said, the appearance and aroma of this beer is fantastic.",0.7097651025637327,4.25,0.9888
Swish,"Poured from a can into a tulip   A. Pours a nice golden transparent beer with a white foamy 1"" head. Head retention is short but had decent lacing around the glass.   S. Tropical fruits. Mango, melon, some pine.   T. Totally agreeing with the nose I get tropical fruits, pine and some nice sweet biscuit malts. Slight bitterness. Tasty candy apple aftertaste.   M. Not a real heavy DIPA. 4 out of 10 on thickness. Smooth. Not a ton of carbonation but just enough. Finishes pretty clean.   O. A very nice DIPA. Flavor and aroma is great. Some DIPA's can be a little too heavy but this is really nice. A top notch DIPA for sure.",0.6679122147416647,4.5,0.9888
Swish,"Released Dec. 5, 2015, enjoyed Dec. 9, 2015.  Full review Dec 13, 2015.  A - Light peach juice body with hues of apricot through the center. Nice retention and lace on a fine white head that pours 2 fingers high.  S - Sweet delicious passion fruit and papaya. Just a touch of herbal bitters balance out the nose.  T - Outstanding. Bold bitter cilantro and thyme highlight a brisk tropical frame of dried mango, passion fruit paste and fresh papaya. Bright wood and pine through the finish.   M - Smooth medium light frame with nice carbonation.  O - A fantastic example of the tropical side of DIPA's.",0.6811929282683062,4.75,0.9887
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"For the record, Elijah Craig 12 Year is my go to bourbon, so there might be a bias. The aroma is nicely nuanced with the bourbon all the same. Notes of coconut, vanilla, and oak barrel show up, but conceal the base stout somewhat. Flavors of vanilla opens it, closes it, and do everything else in between. There are gentle touches of smoke and roast also near the back end, but otherwise the simplistic nature of the base beer really lets things down. At least the bourbon presence rocks (duh!) I also like how easygoing it is for 11%, however - the honey creates a dry finish that counteracts the sweetness some. Oak tannins also keeps the mouthfeel dry (but slightly astringent). This one is a decent barrel-aged stout that showcases one of my favorite bourbons nicely, but is a letdown in most other aspects. At $30 a bottle, I don't need to have it again.  3.52/5: Good, but at $30 I may as well just buy regular Elijah Craig bourbon",0.6783552910108769,3.5,0.9887
Black Tuesday,"Split a bomber with my brother in law after we had already had another barrel aged stout. Wow, did this beer kick my ass! This was the highest ABV beer I had ever had and I felt it. It was well worth it though as this beer was great.  Pour appears somewhat thin but the mouthfeel was super thick and chewy. Maybe the barrel aging thinned out the beer but fortunately it did not affect the mouthfeel.   The taste is sweet and malty with a huge bourbon backbone. The sweetness I expected with the high alcohol content but what was nice was there wasn't any kind of alcohol burn despite the potency of the beer.  Overall, this beer was probably one of the best 10-15 beers I have ever had. I know I won't get many chances to try this with Black Tuesday not hitting general distribution. Quite the treat.",0.6285743588443741,4.25,0.9887
Green,"Canned last week, poured into a tree house tulip.   Looks like a hazy juice bomb. Some lacing, but it sticks.  Smells like tangerine or oranges, but lighter on the fruit than their normal beers. More hops on the nose.  Taste is amazing. It's hopped up for sure. Nice bright fruit, balanced, and juicy.  Mouth feel is medium bodied with a smooth Finish.  Overall. Love it. They don't disappoint. This brew was juicy with hops, and a nice finish. Wish I had more but I only got one of these.",0.6657885386817092,4.75,0.9887
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"500 ml bottle - frankly in my fridge quite a while but still great. Pours a slightly hazy golden pale orange with well packed 2 finger white head. Aroma of banana, bubble gum, little bit of spice. Taste is ultra smooth - sweet clovey citrus, banana, again a bit of bubble gum - void of any happiness with nice creamy but still well carbonated mouthfeel. Very easy drinking - great summer beer on our last week of summer (though high of 6 C today....).",0.6421073783641968,4.25,0.9887
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Sampled at Dark Lord Day '09 in a clear plastic cup.  A: Pours like a black hole, with no light getting through and some copperish/khaki colored bubbles that settled down to almost nothing.  S: Smells very similar to the original of course with some additions; major chocolate, slight roast, but more vanilla/butterscotch flavors similar in most oak aged beers  T: just like the scent, the flavor was also obviously very similar to its regular DL brethren; chocolate big time, slight roast, and the addition of some vanilla, butterscotch with much more of a boozy flavor finish. I don't know if this had ANY bourbon addition to the aging process or if they were just normal barrels or oak chips or what, but it definitely seemed like there was some bourbon in this.  M: Super creamy and coated everything it touched. Low carbonation, similar to a syrup but it matched the rest of the beer excellently.  D: I really enjoyed the flavor and addition of different tastes from the oak aging, although it seemed to increase the boozy alcohol flavor big time which sort of cancels out each other. If they could keep the flavor additions and knock down the alcohol, then this would easily overtake the regular DL for me.",0.6438153300265262,4.0,0.9887
Peche 'n Brett,"750ml bottle of the 2014 release. Poured into a Cigar City snifter today, 4/23/2014.  A- Dark yellow, hazy body with a one finger white head with solid retention, some lacing, nothing different from the base Seizoen-Bretta, to be honest. Though this is certainly hazier than I remember the base being.  S- Peach juice, a little bit of horseblanket funk, no acidity at all, slight tartness, some pale malt. But make no mistake about it, this is tasty peach juice.  F- Palate on this beer is even better than it smells. Some stone fruit skin, peach juice, slight horseblanket funk without any rubbery off-flavours, slight tartness, sharp wheatiness and a bit of spice. No real acidity to this but I will not complain about how much peach character there is.  M- Medium bodied, incredibly drinkable, plenty of carbonation that is very refreshing similar to the base beer. And there is absolutely no indication that this is a 10% ABV beer. Wow.  O- Excellent drinking experience, one of the best peach beers I think I'll ever have the chance to try. It's a nice improvement on the base Seizoen-Bretta, and I can't imagine the peach will stay around for much longer. This is a beer I definitely recommend drinking fresh.",0.6833722094247443,4.5,0.9887
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"A- Dark pink with some yeast chunks (optional) floating around randomly throughout. Small fizzy head builds up but dies down quite quickly.  S- Nice sour cherry pie. Brettanomyces funk is laced throughout lending a good level of ""funk"". Mostly just a sour cherry bomb. A definite wine grape and vinegar note as well.  T- Once again mostly a huge cherry bomb. I really like the level of sour in this, especially in the finish, perfect for the big fruit flavor. Nice vinous wine grape, vinegar and oak notes as well.  MF- Very thin body with high carbonation and the obvious cheek puckering sour.  The finish of this is superb. The cherry, wine, vinegar and vinous notes combine to form a great flavor.",0.670626029365682,4.5,0.9886
Beatification,"Batch 5  A: Hazy yellow to golden in color, light white head dissipating pretty quick. Ok lacing.  S: WOW, the smell along on the beer blows me away, SO MUCH FUNK. Very complex, goes from smelling really good first sniff to smelling like something rotten next sniff back to really good next sniff. So weird, so good!  T: Almost no funk at all in the flavor, has a very clean crisp sour flavor. Fruity, spicy and complex. Flavor is very light but also rich at the same time. amazing!  M: Light, smooth, good carbonation  O: This beer is like nothing else, the difference between the smell and the taste is something else. Would be interesting to drink a sanctification right next to it. Awesome beer but for $15 bucks a pop I'll be trading it more than drinking it.",0.6593830196113879,4.5,0.9886
Juicy,"Reviewed from notes: Consumed 5/21/14 with my buddy an hour before his wedding. Thanks again jstillwell!  A: Hazy dark copper body topped with a creamy one finger head that persists for a long time. As per usual from HF, the beer is absolutely glowing.  S: Dear God... Can literally smell this across the room. Tons of fruit upfront including mango, pineapple, and zesty orange. Tart white wine and bretty funk take up the back end of the aroma. One of the best aromas I've ever encountered from a beer.  T: Tart citrus followed by acidic white wine grapes. Brett has clearly taken over at this stage, and gives off notes of musty tropical fruit. Grainy malt rounds everything out. Not as mind blowing as the nose, but extremely balanced.  M: Medium bodied and airy mouthfeel. Typical superb HF mouthfeel. What does Shaun Hill do to his water?!  O: An amazing beer that I only wish I could have tried fresh when the hops were still a factor. Hopefully I can now that's it's been rebrewed. An extremely appropriate beer to be sharing with friends before such an important event.",0.6856118392981438,4.5,0.9886
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"The natural affinity that stout has with coffee is highlighted in Jackie O's collaboration with Stauf's Roasters, resulting in an imperial stout with a bold coffee lead. To top it off, a nice long bourbon barrel slumber softens the roasty edges but offers an opulent, savory taste throughout.  Savory and decadent to the nose, its fragrance billows over with nutty, soilish Jamaican coffee, oak, caramel, molasses, vanilla, dark fruit and chocolate. Dark brown and layered with a delicate coffee-like creme, its tawny crimson hues are off-black while its taste is toasty, cocoa, sherry-like and savory.  As the flavors develop across the middle, the beer's body is lighter than expected but its flavors are complex and bold. A delicate weave of date, fig and plum with a cherry-like balance to add richness and a pleasant acidic tang to the savory molasses, maple, chocolate and brown sugar. Earthy coffee rises as the stout continues to dry and its finish is roasty, oaky and spicy with peps of caramel, coconut and vanilla.  Full but relaxed, the bold flavors close with a dry, spicy and bouron-esque taste and texture. Lightly tannic to promote a powdery oak, and peppery, woodsy finish with the warmth of sherry and bourbon aligning on the after-palate. A long finish of coffee and molasses ensures a most dessert-like end to any session.",0.695374898309571,4.25,0.9886
Black Tuesday,"2013 release.  A: The bottle releases some smoke as it opens. Pours a dark black, not quite opaque, with dark red highlights if held up to a light. There's a little bit of tan head, which mostly disappears except for a very thin rim around the edge of the glass.  S: Extremely dense and sweet, noticeable as soon as the bottle is cracked. Deep notes of anise, cherry, and booze. Kind of like a cocktail, maybe something with good blanco tequila, but with a denser sweetness. So rich, and so good.  T: Dense mid-high sweetness from the start through the finish, with slightly bitter hop notes through the finish and throughout the aftertaste. Very sweet, strong, dense, and enjoyable.  M: Extremely full body, medium to low carbonation.  Overall, wow. Exceptional. Also, dangerously, extremely, and unabashedly strong. I have had maybe a fifth of the bottle and I can feel it, and that is very unusual. You should probably taste this with many people, to keep you from drinking as much of it as you want. Because you will want all of it, and that is not healthy.  Recommended.",0.6874218520420249,4.5,0.9885
Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Has a very barrel forward nose, defined by leather, wet basement, moldy wood and yogurt. The interesting thing about this is, that there is a recognizable freshness, coming from the base beer, at the same time. It provides aromas of lemon zest, soft wheat and dried herbs, building up a perfectly enjoyable collision.  Has a fine effervescence with a light, sour and dry body, making this remarkably refreshing, with a nice smoothness to it.  Tastes of an initial flavor explosion on the palate, mellowed by a pleasant yeast silkness, enriching unripe grapefruits, kiwi pulp, mushrooms and blue cheese amongst warming campfire wood. Turns a tad sweeter, with toffee joining in, highlighting the oranges by adding a fruity sweetness, entagled into the oak. This gets softened by an aqueous quality, producing just a light hint of spices, perfectly integrating lemon zest and a late herb dryness with some prevailing mushrooms.   Incredibly well nuanced beer with an absolutely astonishing complexity, while it drinks almost too easy with a world class mouthfeel. This may be the closest thing i‘ve yet enjoyed so far to a belgian saison / lambic from the US and puts up this brewery with the very best in the world for me.",0.7272902104140574,5.0,0.9885
Society & Solitude #4,"Thanks LambicKing! Pours a fairly hazy peach color with a great fluffy white head with great retention and lacing.   Lovely nose full of tropical fruit, pineapple, apricot, mango and citrus peels.   Flavor is fantastic. Amazing light citrus. Fantastically balanced with a slightly fruity sweetness up front and finishing with a lovely citrussy and mildly bitter hop back end.   Mouthfeel is phenomenal. So light and crisp. So good on this un-godly hot CA summer day.   Overall, God I wish HF was in CA. I've had this and Abner as far as their ipas and both are just phenomenal!",0.7164041700267739,5.0,0.9885

Coolship Red,"A- Ruby blood-pink body, one finger light pinkish head. Quite a bit less head and retention than I'd expect for the style, but certainly not flat in appearance. No lacing. These pinkish-purple beers are always a thing of beauty.  S- Raspberry juice, touch of wheat, a good bit of funk that mixes with the raspberry juice. A different kind of funk than Cantillon Rosé de Gambrinus, certainly less funky but it does have a distinct, leathery character.  F- Not particularly complex but quite tasty- raspberries, a bit of musty hay, vinegar (5/10 sour), no lactate, a bit of lemon helps round the palate out. The acidity is nicely balanced with the raspberry sweetness which is not jammy at all. The raspberry presence is basically its essence without the jam or syrup that we're used to in other walks of life.  M- Medium bodied, sufficiently carbonated but seems to me that this is a little flatter than I would expect of a wild ale.   O- Beautiful looking wild ale with a nice raspberry character that translates very well to the beer's character without being too unbalanced.",0.7081056493699954,4.25,0.9885
Peche 'n Brett,"From 02/27/15 notes. HUGE thanks to the combo of nimbleprop, nmann08, and jslot38 for busting this out at my bachelor party in Charleston...one of my biggest wants.  Pours a hazy, burnt golden-orange color with two fingers of fluffy off white head and moderate carbonation evident. The nose is absolutely amazing; light tart delicious peach juice. Taste has more oak spice, yeast, grains, bready malts, oranges, and tropical notes. Medium body and moderate carbonation, easy to drink...doesn't feel like 10%.  Overall I love this; I like Logsdon a lot and this is their best beer by far. The nose is perfect; would love to get this one again sometime. Hope it comes to NYC more often.",0.6581932731648902,4.75,0.9885
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Thanks to foofaa for bringing this one to ffej of july. Not sure of the year but definitely a recent vintage. Served alongside an original 2003 Drie Fonteinen Kriek.  A - Pours bright ruby red with a nice one finger tall white head leaving spotty streaks of lace down parts of the glass.  S - Smells of fresh sour cherries, wet oak, musty basement funk and a bit of sugary sweetness. The cherries dominate the nose from start to finish.  T - This one is sour cherries through and through. Hints of musty basement, barnyard funk, bit of sugar and plenty of oak offer some some contrast but the cherries are never far from the front. Finish is dry, lingering on the palate long after consumption.  M - Smooth body with a ton of flavor and moderate carbonation. Tart feel with a touch of sweetness, pretty dry toward the end of each sip.  O - This is what I am looking for when I want a true kriek. The cherries are intense yet the sour funk keeps them in check. This bottle reminds me that I need more of these asap.",0.6529615794512397,4.5,0.9884
Enjoy By IPA,"What better way to celebrate beer review #100 than with a big and bitter DIPA from Stone.  Date: Canned on 03/13/19, imbibed on 04/02/19, enjoy by 04/20/19.  Appearance: Enjoy by pours out a deep gold color producing two fingers of a pillowy white head. This is one ultra filtered beer, totally devoid of any of haze or floating particulate, it does look very inviting though.  Aroma: Dank herbal notes blanket the nose followed by malts that evoke notes of honey and graham cracker. There is also tons of pine mixed with some tea leaf. This smell much like Bells Hopslam, less the overt honey presence in that one. Enjoy By gives off an all around pleasant aroma that is wonderfully representative of a west coast style DIPA.  Taste: A varied and multilayered hop profile almost attacks the palate with an unrelenting bitterness that drives through to the finish. Aside from that, the hops are hard at work producing different flavors at different stages. Up front, Enjoy By is very herbaceous, then bleeding into light citrus territory, and finally giving off some berry flavors which circulate around the back end. The finish brings the bitter herb driven qualities back with plenty of piney resinous bite with just enough of the honey and graham cracker like malts to round things off. After it warms up good, some green onion, more honey, and some rosemary pop out. The mouthfeel is appropriately thick and chewy without falling into that syrupy sweet malt mess which most +9% DIPAs tend to do. Enjoy By is a really nice beer, shocker there. I do find the pricing a bit high ($17.49 + tax) when I can get beers of equal quality such as Fear Movie Lions or Stone IPA for around $11. I am happy to have tried it regardless.",0.695361014010706,4.25,0.9884
Dragonsaddle,"*Note* My review below is based on the original release, which is significantly different, and better, than the current (fall 2016) version which is a very turbid/murky yellow gold color with a lot more bitting yeast flavor and way more fruit than hops. It is mainly a boozy, yeasty, mess of a beer now. It also falls off very quickly. I didn't even finish my 4 pack after giving away the other 2. Very disappointed. 3.5 at best    It is a slightly cloudy, orange-copper gold brew with a moderate off-white head that dwindles into a soapy ring pretty quick.   Mango, pineapple, mango, pineapple. Tons of stanky fruit and earthy malts in the aroma along with some candied sugars.   It is exploding Jerry Bruckheimer style with fermented pineapple, mango, and red grapefruit. Slightly sour, but more sweet. There is a rock candy sweetness similar to Six Point's Hi-Res. A spicy kick comes through a lot early. It is very citrus based. It closes out with a blast of pine and resin to put a little west in midwest. Very clean with a very subtle bitterness. Dangerously drinkable at almost 12%. Noticable alcohol? Yeah, but it drinks like an 8-9%  Like most HH brews, the body is as smooth as a stoned Miles Davis. Great semi-chewy/fluffy feel.   This one gives Roller Blabe some competiton for my favorite beer of theirs, which is a lot in itself. A world class ipa, and one of the best Ohio has to offer.",0.6647137402391242,4.5,0.9884
Haze,"Got this bad boy in a trade, can't wait to try it! Poured into a tulip glass from a 1 Pint can, 8.2% ABV. Bottled date 5/25/17.  Look: Pours a beautiful opaque gold, thin white head of foam, heavy lace. Smell: Intense piney aromas right away, but with a subtle sweetness that creeps up on you. Distinct notes of tangerine and grapefruit also clearly present. UPDATE: emergence of guava in the smell, not easily noticeable right away, but very apparent in the back of the nose. Amazing. Taste: Again, very hop forward but equally matched in flavor by an intensely bitter grapefruit balance that is unmistakable. Feel: Incredibly smooth and drinkable, I would never guess that the ABV clocked in at 8.2%.  This beer is truly unique and incredible. It pours an amazing golden color and the smell is subtle but so potent. At first, with such an amazing look and smell, the mild flavors almost took me back! But after a few more sips and a bit of warmth, it really transformed. Can't get over how smooth this DIPA is, really remarkable. There's a reason Tree House stands tall among American craft breweries. Get it if you can!",0.6978211125852649,4.5,0.9884

S: Funky, and poignant. Basically a hop head's dream. T: Bittery citrusy goodness, which in my opinion could be stronger but still hits home hard.  F: It's a Stone IPA at almost 10%, that basically in a nut shell should tell you the feel. O: 4.69, great beer.

Society & Solitude #4,"Presentation: 64 oz. screwtop growler filled on Saturday at the brewery. Keep chilled since being filled. Poured into a pint glass and enjoyed.  Appearance: Cloudy straw yellow in color. Pours a nice full, three finger head. Leaves a really nice lacing up and down the glass.  Aroma: Huge citrus aromas upfront. Lots of tropical fruit, mango, pineapple, and some resiny pine. A really pleasant and aromatic hop profile.  Taste: Cirtus and tropical fruit notes really shine here as well. The bitterness is not overpowering at all. Tons of mango, pineapple, and grapefruit. Some pine comes in near the end, but any of the bitterness is offset by some of the sweetness of the alcohol and malt, which adds a touch of light honey. Really balanced and tasty. Completely drinkable.   Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and very crisp. Really refreshing and easy to drink.  Overall, another spectacular Hill Farmstead IPA. Definitely one of my new favorites and one I would like to have them revisit soon. Really tropical, balanced and refreshing. Considering the ABV, this is really easy to drink a lot of. A definite winner.",0.7040897521697852,4.5,0.9884
Fort Point Pale Ale,"I've had the Enigma-hopped variant, but boy howdy, I surely prefer the original - beautiful, creamy head, wonderfully hazy and juicy. This exemplifies what I love about NE IPAs.

Vicinity,"From a 16oz can purchased at the brewery about 3 weeks ago  It is a turbid, bright orange-gold color. The wispy off white head had decent retention, but was fairly small even with an aggressive pour. There are a few floaties in it too.   Outstanding aroma. A lot of tropical fruits, including pineapple, grapefruit, passion fruit, and a little tangerine along with yeast, a crisp pilsner like grain, and a little bit of dank/medical green.   It pretty much tastes like it smells. Even though my scores are the same, I think the aroma might be just a hair better because of the aspirin like bitterness that leaves a bit of a chalky aftertaste, but there is a bunch of fruit, without being a typical hopless, NE juice bomb. A little spicy up front with grapefuit, pineapple, guava and passion fruit. Definitely plenty of dank green leafy hops to balance all of the aforementioned. There is a definite pilsner malt flavor along with an earthy/limestone mineral/well water taste.   Not as chewy/full bodied as some of their others. The oats must be dialed back a bit. Still pretty smooth.",0.7006010054240153,4.0,0.9883
Haze,"Straight pour from a 16oz can to an oversized wineglass (TH stemware, for those curious). There’s a canning date of May 2, 2016 printed in black ink on the underside of the can, which reads “KEEP COLD 05 02 16 SUHH DUDE”—which would make this five days old at the time of consumption. This was purchased at the brewery on the 4th, and it immediately went into the fridge so these are essentially ideal tasting circumstances.   Appearance (4.5): Two very full fingers of creamy, custard-colored foam rise happily off of the pour, capping a cloudy, orange and honey-colored body. The head dies down relatively slowly, leaving scattered suds near the peak of the head, a half-finger collar, and a diminutive clump of foam near the center. As the body goes down, it leaves a solid sheath of foam on the far side of the glass, with peaks and valleys in its profile.   Smell (4.5): Positively pungent, nectar-like citrus dominates the nose: musky papaya flesh, sticky mango juice, and passion fruit. It blends smoothly with sugar cookie-like sweetness, country bread, and earthy tones paired with a slightly grassy aroma. A dank, weedy note brings up the rear. As it warms, it shifts more toward passion fruit and sauvignon blanc-like gooseberry notes, as well as a much stronger musk. This is seriously excellent stuff.   Taste (4.5): This shit is bonkers. I’m not entirely sure what’s going on here, honestly—it starts off with a combination of papaya muskiness and a kind of earthy, bready component. A little bit of guava and strawberry come out, followed by passion fruit, a limeade mix of citric tartness and light, balancing sweetness, and pink grapefruit flesh with sugar sprinkled on top. A grassy note mixes in at this point, making for a slightly cannabis-like feel. All throughout, a layer of sugar cookie sweetness tempers any bitterness, helping to accentuate the fruitiness of it all. Amazingly, there’s no noticeable booziness in the flavor, thought a slight spiciness does come up in the finish.   Mouthfeel (4.25): Smooth, slick, and somewhat on the full- side of medium-weight, with a juicy, nectar-like feel. Still, the oily hop presence dries out the feel significantly just as the beer finishes. All throughout, the carbonation is fine-grained, subtle, and smooth, matching the body’s thickness with its creamy feel. The alcohol appears here just a bit, with a boozy dryness that blends in with the hop bitterness. Smooth and satisfying, with a feel that matches its heft and hop load.   Overall (4.5): This is, in the end, an outstanding, smooth, supremely fruity, satisfying DIPA. This is, effectively, New England-style hop juice, and there’s not an unpleasant thing about it, but it does lack some of the depth and complexity of my very favorite DIPAs. NOT THAT I AM COMPLAINING FOR EVEN A SECOND—just explaining what might separate this from the most world-class of world-class DIPAs. This is still, in every single way, an absolute joy to drink. I’m guessing it goes without saying . . . but this is highly recommended.",0.7061679793616266,4.5,0.9883

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Thanks to makdeco for sending this out my way.   2008 Vintage. Warning: the cork shot out of the bottle as soon as I took the cap off - it was slightly terrifying.  Beer pours a dark purplish ruby red with a fluffy pinkish-white head. The smell is fantastic - raspberries stand out most, but there's a nice mix of funk, sour and oak in there as well. The flavor is still good, but not quite as impressive as the nose. It's a bit simpler than I expected. The raspberry flavor is great, and it's quite sour, but there's not much funk or anything else happening here. It's not too sweet and comes off much drier than its little sister Rose de Gambrinus. Mouthfeel is thin with heavy carbonation, would've liked a little more body here. Overall, this is another fine beer from Cantillon, but I wouldn't rank this up there with the best of their lambics. I enjoyed it more than Rose de Gambrinus, but of the Lou Pepe beers, it's definitely the simplest. A good fruit lambic, but I don't know if I'd seek this out again given what it costs.",0.6477410255959059,4.0,0.9883
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Pitch black pour with a beautiful mocha tan head with little retention. Looks frothy and delicious, beautiful! Oh boy, big coffee, big barrel, reminds me initially of bcbcs - I'm salivating. Sip is soft at the beginning with huge coffee notes, a bit bitter from the cocoa/coffee beans. Would not call this sweet, and even a bit thin but I'll wait for it to warm up to see if this changes at all. Feel is soft as mentioned previously, coats the tongue with coffee and cocoa. Now that it's warming up I was hoping it would thicken and sweeten but not much has changed. Overall an excellent beer, right up there with some of the better coffee stouts I've ever had, Jackie O's does barrel aging with the best of them, will definitely seek this out again!",0.6185907991560584,4.5,0.9882
Society & Solitude #4,"Pouring this beer from a 12 oz. can into a snulip glass, this beer pours out like a thick sunny d; bright orange. It forms a pinky width of white, creamy crown that leaves slight lacing.   Before even putting my nose to the glass, I smell juice. It’s a really delightful, clean juice. A lot like sunny d itself. Clean and bright citrus presence; like orange juice, tangerine.  The taste follows suit well. This thing is a little one dimensional with the citrus juice, but it’s so good at what it does, that you can’t fault it for it. Sunny d just keeps coming to mind. So clean.  The mouthfeel has a slight and balanced citrus tang to it. It’s soft, somewhat creamy; but not a hugely thick creamy and clean all the way through. No burn, just smooth clean ness.   Overall, man I see why this thing is a legend. As previously stated, it’s a little one dimensional, but that one dimensional is awesome. And every aspect of it is screaming clean, from the front to the back, the looks to the feel. This thing is hotter than my first pistol that I bought in the hood when I was 15.",0.6777484532231912,4.5,0.9882
Society & Solitude #4,"A bit dank! Tropical, sweet, juicy, and delicious. This is legendary for a reason.  This is my third Society and Solitude experience, in reverse order starting with 6. I had 5 just recently at a bottle release (Pulpit Rock Fat Joe), but was tremendously drunk (and had a bad cold) when I tasted it. Thus, #6 is all that I can really compare against - and I have to say that #4 is the best and most memorable of the three.  The beer pours a very pleasant orange, with a finger's width of white head. Aesthetically, quite pleasing. It smells lovely and tastes of rich, ripe citrus - it's one of the more ""orange"" tasting beers I've had (even more so than Julius, which is kind of sad). That flavor is so nice and full, but it's not a heavy, filling beer. Quite light. I could drink several of these (though likely should not).  S&S#4 is a fantastic beer.",0.6543824649284946,4.75,0.9882
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"L: Hazy golden orange capped by an enormous creamy, pillowy white head. Nearly perfect retention, with gobs of sticky lacing.  S: Yellow banana, orange peel, green apple, pear, white bread, honey, vanilla, straw, and clove.  T: Sweet banana like Runts banana candy, complimented by orange zest and more subtle orchard fruits such as red and green apple and pear. The malt backbone correlated with the mouthfeel, being more of a pillowy, doughy sensation than an actual taste, with a dab of that aforementioned honey and vanilla. Upon further drinking, I even notice notes of honeydew melon and green grape. On the back end, the ripe banana/apple/pear/orange sweetness transitions into a light dryness with notes of straw, coriander and clove, giving way to a refreshing clean finish.  F: A little thin than expected given the appearance, but still great. Soft and smooth and gently creamy, a bit thin in the middle, but with a nice moderate carbonation that makes it thirst-quenching and refreshing.  O: Does a traditional hefeweizen get any better than this? Leave it to the Germans to invite AND perfect this tasty style. Truly a world-class beer.",0.6777203012848856,4.75,0.9882
Nectarine Premiere,"Pours incredibly cloudy, golden/orange, with a medium sized head that quickly recedes leaving no lacing. Some chunks of nectarine can be seen in the bottom of the pour.  Smells like the freshest nectarine you've ever had, and then more! Sweet fruit, tart, lemony, some granny smith apple, and some lacto funk. Absolutely stunning aroma!  The taste follows the nose almost perfectly. There is minimal sweetness as the tartness is taking the forefront. Sharp, but welcome sourness. The lacto has done a great job here! Wonderful fruit presence despite the sweetness being in the background.  Medium bodied with light carbonation. Puckering tartness, and a nice dryness in the finish.  An absolutely impeccable fruited sour! De Garde has done it again, and gone above and beyond in this case. This can hold its own against the Fou' Founes and other top tier fruited sours of the world!",0.6937777796996949,4.75,0.9881
Oude Geuze Vintage,"well the gueze monster is at it again, this time with the oude gueze vintage  I am a big fan of the series, and have had oude gueze and golden blend, so we shall see what is what with it.  appearance is pretty standard, nice orange hazy color, tints of yellow floating around  smell- gosh darnit, armand has done it again ! huge funk, cheese notes and serious gueze/lambic sourness, i'm getting some light citrus acidity and vinegary type of smell. way more pungent than golden blend and regular put together  taste- does not disappoint, extremely sour, mouth feel about as full as I have ever experienced, typical belgian gueze sour notes but to the max, awesome front of the tongue singe and the sour notes ride a gnarly wave across your palate and stick around after the finish for quite some time. impressively coats the mouth with an awesome sour funk flavor   although i certainly lack the vocabulary to better describe this, one this is for certain, this is an amazing gueze. WAYYY better than regular and golden blend, and a close second for me personally ( isabelle proximus barely holding on to the number one slot).  its mean, its a vintage and it should be obtained at all costs.

Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"2015 bottle poured into a voodoo teku. Drank at 51 degrees.  L - pours dark, dark, dark brown. Very frothy light brown with hues of red. Awesome sticky lacing.  S - as soon as I cracked it I was hit with bourbon and coffee from an arms length away. Bringing it closer theres the signa ture jackie o's massive amounts of bourbon. The coffee is prominent but not in your face. Loads of vanilla and carmelized sugar. The sweetness is very intense.  T - the coffee is a definitely a very dark roast, but it's not at all bitter. Next comes intense oak of the bourbon. Very, very woody forward with vanilla and toffee not far behind. The spiciness of the alcohol is very prominent, especially considering 2 years old. The more it warms the more it drink like an iced frappuccino.  F - very creamy. Far on the dry side. Maybe a touch thin, and as already mentioned heavy with alcohol.  O - quite good. A nice slow sipper.",0.6168296000516353,4.25,0.9881
Society & Solitude #4,"Drank on tap at Armsby Abbey, Worcester, MA Served in a snifter  Outstanding appearance. The cloudy, yellow ochre liquid was topped by a one-finger finger tall, frothy, bright white head. Drippy sheets of lacing trickled along the glass. The head dropped to a thick, bubbly, lasting ring.  The aroma was phenomenal. Uber hoppy and fruity with loads of tropical fruit notes. Passionfruit dominated. Peach and apricot also came through strong. There was an intensely dank, marijuana-like quality as well. Semi sweet. Juicy tangerine notes were apparent. Touch of citrusy tartness.  The flavor profile was similar to the nose and just as stellar. Peach and mango notes hit hard right off the bat. Incredibly fruity and tropical. Passionfruit again came through super strong. Good dose of mango. Really juicy. Tangerine was detectible. There was a slight lemony tartness on the back end. The beer finished with just a touch of grapefruit rind-like bitterness.  The mouthfeel was pillowy soft and fluffy. Creamy and slick on the palate. For the style, a bit lighter bodied than expected yet so smooth.  Just when I thought I had tried the best that Hill Farmstead has to offer, another beer comes along that makes me rethink just how amazing their beer really is. Society & Solitude #4 is possibly the most tropical fruit-forward double IPA I have ever encountered. This beer definitely ranks up there as one of my all-time favorites.",0.6923626115196049,5.0,0.9881
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Deep brown to black in color. Opaque in the middle and clear on the edges. No head. Minimal lacing on a swirl.  Nose is very much booze, licorice, sweet fruit, bourbon, and minor oak.  Taste is bourbon and oak, coffee and Expresso, licorice, sweet fruit, roasted malt, and booze.  Mouthful is medium to heavy and smooth. Carbonation is low. Finish is warm but dry.  Expedition stout is a great base beer to barrel age. Am very glad I finally got the opportunity to try this. For the coffee enthusiast, this is the jam. Very much a melange of bourbon and coffee that would definitely age well and cool down with time. Hopefully Bell's distributes this beer in the future.",0.6516837873018101,4.25,0.9881
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Bell's Brewery ""Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged"" 12 FL OZ brown glass bottle, ""PKG 10/16/2018 PRN 23038"" $7.49 @ Total Wine & More, Cherry Hill, NJ  Notes via stream of consciousness: I guess i should have been a little more aggressive with my pour, I've only got a quarter inch of brown foam atop its black body. It's got pretty good retention though, especially given that it's 13.4% alcohol by volume. It smells of rich dark malts, Bourbon, and tobacco. There's a distinct dark chocolate note, some dark caramel syrup, and a little bit of oak. It's pretty intense and I can only imagine that it'll open up as it warms. This is one of those beers that you can almost enjoy just by sitting and smelling it - of course no one would have the will power to do that. OK, on to the flavor... it's just as intense if not more, and there are additional notes of dark fruit, hot chocolate/cocoa, molasses, and coffee to it. Everything previously noted still comes through, and the Bourbon and oak are in just the right place; sometimes there can be too much or too little. It doesn't seem that bitter and yet it's surprisingly well balanced. The alcohol helps, but it doesn't come too far forward, well, any further than you'd expect for 13.4%. Ahh, and there's that note of coconut I always find in Bourbon barrel beers. Interesting. I'd say that this is one of the best Imperial stouts on earth except that the Bourbon barrel aging almost makes it something completely different. It's impressive. In the mouth it's full bodied and slick, oily, and almost velvety but for a delicate caress from the carbonation and alcohol. I really wish I had a standard Expedition with me to taste it side by side but I didn't think of that. Oh well.  Review# 6,508",0.6604816574854938,4.75,0.9881
Haze,"16 oz can. Funny story: As I finally walked in the doors after a 45 min wait in line and freezing temps the sweet sound of the Grateful Dead's Sugar Magnolia greeted me from the TreeHouse sound system. The bottom of the can reads: ""Going where the wind goes, bloomin' like a red rose""   A white haze to the yellow and golden liquid. Thick and healthy, totally unfiltered. Brawny white foam cap, thick, all-white clumps. Huge lacing left over.   The aroma has a very zesty citrus hop effect, mellon and mango, grainy earthiness, tropical fruit blend with a bitter to sweet effect, then a peppery kick at the end. Very aromatic.   The flavor is just bursting with complex hops, zesty earthy tones, sweet orange, peppery malt, clean fresh feel and overall vibe. A crispy bite wakes you up, full and lush mouthfeel follows from a totally unfiltered experience.   The feel and flavor finishes with a fun, earthy, zesty dry bite. Tropical juicy, zesty citrus, zippy golden wheat malt, melons, rustic earthiness sums up the taste pretty well. Levels of complexity are deep. It's an interesting ride for sure.   Overall, this one stands somewhere near the very precipice of the New England style 2x IPA's.",0.7237203884867222,4.5,0.9881

Peach, juicy bright berries, pineapple, apple, tangerine, mango, fresh doughy malt. Wow. Super crisp and happy.  T: Also high on the awesome scale. Sooo juicy and clean. So happy. After a few beers from this brewery I'm noticing a pattern. Clean and juicy. Dank, fresh, very well blended, very delicate. Fruit, fruit, fruit, floral, pine, and grain.

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Yes, we did have one of the last pours from the keg at Binny's south loop, and thanks to Katie for the sample, it inspired a full purchase.  Slightly hazy red, you can see through it, with a quickly dissipating head.  Impressive nose, pure fruit with raspberry and a bit of cherry detectable? No, it's not really there, but has some notes of cherry. Maybe the dark roots of the raspberry.  The fruit hits right up front, with a puckering lack of any sweetness, completely dry, some sourness hits in the back, has enough malt backbone so you don't mistake it for juice, a superb refresher, aperitif. Can't really have the words about how fantastic this is, the beer of the year for me so far.  Just light and fruity in the mouth, a sipper not for the abv but for the lightness and effervescence, a good replacement for Champaign.  A highly drinkable beer, if you can find it. Great to share.",0.6741442619372996,5.0,0.9881
Chocolate Rain,"Pours a dark brown with little lacing. Surprisingly htwo finger.head which disappeared quickly. I had this one night after drinking regular bourbon county and there are similarities here like the way the big bourbon flavor shines through. This one has more chocolate. Milk chocolate candy bar doesn't dominate the flavor but clings to my throat after each sip. There is a fair amount of fruit as well in the flavor an especially in the nose. You get bourbon soaked figs and raisins, but I'm also getting juicier fruits as well, possibly cherries and plums. Coconut is present, but you have to look for it. Sweet molasses too. The mouth feel is really good. It's thin but that's to be expected with this ABV. It still clings to palate which enhances each sip. The carbonation seems just right and the feel is smooth and silky. The vanilla is not prominent. Maybe it has faded since this is the 2013 vintage. The high ABV is a great feature and really sets this beer apart. You don't taste the alcohol burn, but the warming sensation is very nice. I would love to try this again but with so many barrel aged stouts out there, I don't think I'll be looking to trade for it in the near future.",0.6576776024085991,4.25,0.9881
Double Orange Starfish,Look: Murky orange super hazy two fingers of fluffy white head. Really nice glass lacing. It looks the part.  Smell: candied citrus fruit big orange tangerine some tropical notes pineapple papaya mango a hint of booze and that yeasty biscuity character I get in aslin beers.  Taste: Right upfront you get this really great malty doughy biscuity flavor then in the mid plate you get those sweet candied citrus and tropical fruit notes of orange pineapples and papaya along with some yeasty qualities the beer finishes with a really nice pithy grapefruit and orange zest bitterness along with some floral characteristics. This is a great balance between malt and hops.  Feel: medium body really soft and creamy. Super smooth maybe a hint of alcohol In the finish but not off putting by any means.  Overall: When I drink IPA'S I like when the hops shine and the malt is there because it has to be. But in this beer that malt plays a key role. It's probably the best example of what malt can do in an IPA if it's done right. Great job with this beer Definitely in the top 2 beers I've had from Aslin!,0.6858734636691385,4.25,0.988

Beatification,"Back when I first started trading and was still knee deep in my ""ticking phase"" of craft beer tutelage, Beatification was probably one of the biggest white whales on the planet, second only to the magnum version of itself.  It's perhaps fitting that I didn't get to try it prior to visiting Belgium and really appreciating what a traditional spontaneously fermented ale is supposed to taste like as well as its potential, else this might not have been an experience I'd wanted to seek out twice, or surely an experience I'd regret initiating as ""FT: b2 BEAT"" was almost impossible to fill an ISO out for.  Although there are some striking parallels one could draw from this beer to its Anderlecht-based inspiration, like many previous attempts to nail down the Bruxellois style in an American setting (e.g. Cable Car, Elements of Composition, Oak Theory) it comes convincing close but isn't quite worthy of rubbing shoulders with their counterparts from Pajottenland.  The aroma actually doesn't stray too far from what you'd expect from a lambic aged in wine barrels. Bright lemon zest, green apple skin, cork, and wet oak comprise the main olfactory component of the ale. The gueuze-resemblant main notes are accentuated by hints of hay, sweaty gym sock-like funk, and some light tannins toward the back end. The oak gently recedes as the brew warms up, letting some of the more sour notes take center stage.  The sensation on the palate mirrors the nose admirably, as acetic notes in the form of bright citrus and sour apples take center stage. The sour characteristic lose their age quickly, however, giving way to a nice cleansing wave of barnyard funk, oak, and some vinous/tannic flavors. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Like most ""American Wild Ale"" interpretations of lambic, however, the finish is rather crisp and clean, instead of some of the sour or the oak-like funky notes lingering in your mouth like that drunk uncle that always sticks around far after the party's finished. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Some of the more drying oak notes makes a brief reappearance after a few sips, but fail to leave a lasting impression. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Medium-light bodied with carbonation more resemblant of sparkling wine than beer. The brew finishes crisp and clean as aforementioned; I'd say the overall mouthfeel is more table beer than a lambic or a gueuze. Considering that a bottle of Gueuze 100% Lambic is barely half the price of what RRBC charges for Beatification, I'd rank it closer to the likes of Geuze Boon Vat no.

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"A 10-12oz sample poured into a little clear plastic cup amongst about 9000 people waiting in line. I was too late to get any VBDL, but was very excited to get to try this one. Appearance is definitive Dark Lord, a small dark tan head. The nose on this one is awesome. Oak and bourbon up front, with dark lord sweetness behind. Chocolate and dark fruit. The taste follows the smell and really delivers. The barrel comes through strong with bourbon and vanilla. The oak really smooths out all of the complex dark lord flavors. Coating and thick mouthfeel, that lingers until you can have another sip. Dark Lord is an incredible beer, but this is an unbelievable beer. One of the best beers I've had the pleasure of having. Can't wait until next year.",0.6401629682805776,4.5,0.9879
Sang Noir,"750ml 2011 project 9.2% ABV. Served in a Russian River stemmed glass  Appearance: Pours a deep red/amber brown color with about a finger of a very light tan head. When held up to light you can see lots of champagne like carbonation streaming from the bottom of the glass. Head retention was strong with quite a bit of lacing.  Smell: Lots of sour cherries, balsamic vinegar, stone fruits, oak, red wine. Some bourbon is present in the nose, but just barely.   Taste: Sour cherries, oak, vanilla, tobacco, red wine, black licorice. Aftertaste is a really interesting mix of bourbon, cherries and vanilla with some red wine character as well. Really complex. Sourness is on the lower end of high.  Mouthfeel: On the lighter side of medium bodied. Despite the amount of visible carbonation in the glass, it feels much less noticeable in the mouth. Finishes dry with a slight gentle warming as it goes down.  Overall: One of the best sours (and best beers for that matter) I've had the pleasure of trying. This is an example of the art of barrel aging at it's finest. Despite the high price tag, I'll definitely seek this out again.",0.6752231967043564,4.75,0.9879

Chocolate Rain,"Do I even need to bother describing the appearance? Pitch black with a very minimal cream head.  This thing reeks of booze and vanilla bean, with chocolate back behind it -- I love it! Taste is the same. Actually reminds me a good bit of World Wide Stout. Big chocolate, licorice, vanilla, ""bourbon"" (and all that entails) and booze. I keep saying ""booze"" -- but don't let that fool you. Also, there's some roast on the palate, which I'm extremely sensitive too -- but it's minimal and quickly overwhelmed by the rest of the beer. This is imminently drinkable and smooth, with a nice warming burn as it goes down. Mouthfeel is syrupy, but not overly thick.  I love it, but I think I loved Black Tuesday even more. And quite frankly, I feel like World Wide Stout scratches the same itch pretty well...and WWS is way more readily available.",0.6485289032064113,5.0,0.9879
Beatification,"Drank batch 5,6,7 side by side. 7 was rather cloudy, the other two were very nice and clean with one of them being quite a bit more amber colored than the others (can't remember which one). As far as taste goes batch 6 was far and away the best and is what my ratings represent. Batch 7 in the beginning was a bit too yeasty but as it warmed the yeast got unpleasantly overpowering. Batch 5 was very good but quit a bit drier and more astringent than the others. Batch 6 was outstanding with just enough sweetness to offset the brilliant sour flavors. All in all the beer didn't live up to my overly high expectations and memory of the last time I drank batch 6 but it's still an outstanding beer.",0.6529238443589409,4.5,0.9879
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Let me preface my review with a little disclaimer: I'm young, developing my palate, and hadn't tried a Lambic until I visited Cantillon in Brussels (good way to start I guess!). Anyways, I ordered a bottle of LPF at the Public Brewing Session. 2012 bottle. Served in a Lambic basket into their stemmed taster glasses. LPF pours a deeper red than Rose de Gambrinus, but lighter than Kriek (I don't know about LPK). It's a deeper pink, compared to a deeper red of Kriek. There was about half an inch of head on my pour, but my buddy got even more on his. Smelled like a wonderful raspberry bomb with the sourness/funk classic of Lambics, so I hear. The taste is wonderful. At the time, I described it as more of everything than Rose de Gambrinus. More raspberry, more carbonation, more enjoyable (not to discredit Rose). The mouthfeel of this is definitely more bubbly, which I loved. Glad I have three of these to take home and enjoy with my family and throw in the cellar. A must taste at some point in one's beer drinking career.",0.6033290729731149,4.75,0.9879
Enjoy By IPA,"By far my favorite beer I have ever had. I mean...come on people. It's amazing. Takes a lot to get 5 star ration across the board. Look is a fantastic light golden haze with bubbles and awesomeness. Smell is like I'm peeling a grapefruit or maybe an orange or maybe a star fruit/grapefruit/orange/tangerine/mango-hybrid. Just incredible. Taste is basically the same as the smell. Just outstanding. Seriously world class stuff here. As far as west coast American IPA's are concerned this is the cream of the crop. Mouthfeel is just outrageous. Crisp, clean, smooth, thick enough to really set the flavors into your tastebuds, light enough to wash away after a moment or two after swallowing. Overall this is probably my favorite beer of all time, and each iteration is just a new and exciting version to sample, every time a new enjoy by comes out it's a nice diversion to a different aspect of the original profile without changing so much as to be unrecognizable as an enjoy by. I look forward to each one, especially the unfiltered editions. Thank you stone!!",0.6481139654763853,5.0,0.9879
Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Bottle shared by Curran- thanks dude.  This one pours a pale, slightly hazy straw yellow, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.  Smells nicely tart and funky, some stone fruit, lemon, and orange, some indeterminate spicing, dry grain, and a slight lactic aroma.  This is absolutely outstanding, a near perfect wild saison. It's got a wonderful dry vinous character, some white wine and oak, and some slight sour grain. There's a lot of juicy and wild-yeasty fruit character, some peach, orange, and tart and spritzy lemon. It's unbelievably drinkable, in the best way possible. The flavor is so deep- the tart citrus just hits you so hard, and doesn't let up. It's remarkable for a beer not made with fruit.  This is medium bodied, with a super juicy and tart mouthfeel, and a moderate level of carbonation.  This is a near perfect farmhouse ale, just a tour de force.",0.6903596210875816,5.0,0.9878
Black Tuesday,"Bottle from 2013  A: Poured into a snifter to a deep black beer topped by a finger and a half of dense tan head that fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing S: Smells of bourbon barrels with that classic oak, caramel, and vanilla. There are also some nice roasty notes along with some chocolate and coffee. Slight molasses note at times as well. Alcohol is a given at this ABV T: Taste is nice and roasty with some bitter dark chocolate covered espresso beans. Nice oak, caramel and vanilla as well. Slightly bitter roasted malts as well that comes off with more of a coffee note. As the beer warms that slight molasses note comes out to play as well. Swallow is saccharine sweet with the caramel and vanilla from the barrel finishing strong with some slight roasted malt flavor toward the end. M: This beer is on the lighter side of being full bodied with a slightly silky feel. Carbonation is low and adequate for the style. With the high abv this one has a dry finish. O: Just a big beautiful beer that is super flavorful, super complex, and super high in alcohol. This is the one that started it all and it still kicks ass. Definitely worth giving a try and least once. This one is a lot more common now so it doesn't have the trade value it used to.",0.6717550352925336,4.75,0.9878
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Drank from a 25.4 fl oz (750 ml) bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA 021115 Served in a pint glass  Super cloudy, yellow ochre appearance. The liquid was topped by a tight, frothy, inch tall, off white crown that quickly fell to a thin film and a bubbly collar. Despite the mediocre head retention, a patchy, drippy wall of lacing coated the glass.  The aroma was super fruity and juicy. Crisp, zesty and bright. Uber citrusy. Orange juice dominated, along with some tangerine and clementine notes. Tropical fruits also came through. Passionfruit was most noticeable. Good amount of mango. There was an intensely dank, weed-like quality as well.   The flavor profile was very similar to the aroma, except even punchier. Amazingly juicy, fruity and sweet. Tangerine and orange notes were most apparent. This almost reminded me of drinking orange juice. Hint of tropical fruitiness. Juicy Fruit gum came to mind. Passion fruit and mango were detectible. Like in the nose, there was a marijuana-like dankness. Tart, lemony notes came through on the back end and in the finish. Touch of pithy and dry orange peel. Just a tad bitter.  The liquid was medium bodied for the style and contained a fine, mild effervescence. Super soft and creamy on the palate. Smooth and supple.  With all the amazing pale ales, IPAs and double IPAs (and variations of each) that Trillium Brewing keeps cranking out, it is easy to see how some can get lost in the fray. While Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street might not break new ground, it is still an amazing offering and perhaps their most juicy and drinkable hoppy beer to date.",0.6949847515693331,4.75,0.9878
Chocolate Rain,"At first I just smell and taste chocolate covered raisins, which is awesome. But as this warms it gets so much more complex. The wood and the whiskey really come out as it warms. A very sweet stout indeed but I don't mind it one bit. Only thing that doesn't scream out to me is the vanilla bean. Would more vanilla make this beer better? Probably. Is this still one of the best BBA stouts I've ever had? Yes. I'll drink this any chance I can get.",0.6169504457225021,4.5,0.9878
Chocolate Rain,"750ml, 2012 vintage 5oz mini tasting snifter  A: Pours out a deep reddish brown. I see others describe this as pitch black, and doing a side by side with BT '11 that is not what we got. Definitely some reddish hints in there and not a thick black at all. I got a layer of off white, light tan head. I was actually surprised to get any head on this high ABV. Tons of alcohol feet.   S: Well, it smells like chocolate that is for sure. Lots of dark and milk chocolate character on the nose. It's masking the vanilla and oak character a little bit that I was pulling more from the BT, but you can still get some coming through. There is a little alcohol booziness coming through, but it's to be expected.  T: Up front, dark super high cocao chocolate. As it progresses, you get more vanilla meshing in to give it sort of a milk chocolate like feeling. I wish there was more roast and/or coffee, but what is there is still delicious. We had this bottle open for a while between us, as it's certainly a sipper. I think I prefer the BT to this, that year did BT well. This is still fabulous beer though. Warming brings out more flavor but also some more booze.  M: Full as full could be.",0.6096486502846843,4.5,0.9878
Haze,"16oz can, purchased from the Brewery, not sure the date, but known to be very fresh. Poured into a Tree House snifter glass. Enjoyed on 3.20.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal.  The beer pours a very turbid golden color with orange hues that is very reminiscent of a glass of orange juice. A thick finger of white head rises with good retention and lots of spotted lace. The aroma is very nice, lots of citrus, orange and grapefruit with some tropical pineapple, a bit of wildflower, sweet yeast, pale dough and some dank pine at the finish. The flavors really explode, lots of bitter pine up front, grassy hops, hop spice, grapefruit peel offer some more spicy bitterness with some refreshing tropical fruit juice with a sweet finish, pale grain, lightly yeasty. The mouthfeel is great, coating, creamy, medium body that has nice life to it with a dry and bitter finish.  Verdict: A very nice DIPA from Tree House. Refreshing, bursting with flavor, well balanced, and as it warms, some pleasant bitterness comes out to contrast against the sweeter nature of the this beer which is much needed.",0.6958847560415095,4.0,0.9878
Mastermind,"thanks to Rob for this, shared with tenderbranson69 enjoyed chilled in a willybecker.  The color is hazed golden with 2 finger white head and thick lace with average bead. The smell has strong dank and herbal hop scent with very fresh and juicy grapefruit tropical aroma. The smell is a raw hop smell like crushed pellets with light pine accent. The feel has a very tangy and juicy quality with light spiceand lightly astringent feel with medium carbonation and light malt sweetness with dry and tangy finish.   The taste is excellent with tangy juicy and citrus acidity with light tangerine fruitiness mixed with a pineapple like acidity with a light pine and grapefruit tinge with mild herbal dank flavor and slight sweet aspect like apricot in the flavor toward the finish. This is an impressive Imperial IPA so much hop flavor it is not hard to compare this to other highly rated Imperial IPA's from Vermont, very enjoyable an outstanding drinkable beer",0.6985931812075353,5.0,0.9878
Darkstar November,"2017-02-23 500ml bottle split between a pair of undersized shakers. I don't see a date, but its the 2016 release, with 13.8% abv.  Pours black with a tiny head and little carbonation. Smell is bourbon barrel aged stout -- vanilla and booze and wood. Coffee and chocolate. Smells great.  Taste is cherrysweet, strong chocolate and a background of coffee, lots of vanilla and booze. Good, but overly sweet. Needs more coffee and roast bitterness.  Mouthfeel is thick, rich, smooth. Overall, this is a quite good beer. It smells awesome.",0.6378440817976617,4.0,0.9877
Todd The Axe Man,"Was super excited to try this, finally got my hands on it!  Really damn good beer. Smooth flavor and easy to drink. Oddly enough I think it was a bit light, I enjoyed Furious more. I bought a 4pack of cans while in MN and had it on draft at Surly and it was super good BUT i know I do a better assessment in the friendly confines of my home.  pours a gold hue with a solid head, looks great.  smell is mild hops.  taste is fruity, i get mango in this. hits hard on bitterness but a clean taste.  oddly enough i don't think is anything mindblowing BUT it does pretty much everything well which is a special trait.",0.6490742062275512,4.75,0.9877
Chocolate Rain,"Reviewed from memory, had this 3 nights ago. Dark brown, not much foam. Subtle carbonation. The nose struck me initally as very estery, almost banana, with vanilla bourbon notes galore. The booziness seems limited at first, but keep on smelling and it starts to get heavy with alcohols. I was expecting lots of chocolate and more roasted malt character but those were not very evident at all.   The taste is much of the same, lots of vanilla character with more estery fruit. It's rich with bourbon, yet not overdone. The alcohol does not burn, and is well integrated in the flavor, but the warming is certainly felt throughout the body. It's a slow sipper but never gets to be too much, and a 4 to 5 ounce sample is a very nice amount to quaff.   Overall a nice beer, and drinkable enough for 19% ABV. It's certainly not worth the hype though, and considering many in the group I shared this with said it was better than Black Tuesday (which I've not tried), that doesn't bode well for Black Tuesday. Worth a try if you get the chance, but don't trade away your gold for it.",0.656060180953002,3.5,0.9877
Haze,"Tasting my fourth tree house IPA ever. Only other ones I've had are green, alter ego, Julius, and this one. So I'll go head and make a few comparisons.  Pour is a beautiful murky, cloud orange. Seems to be a little more straw yellow than the other offerings I've had. Nice tight white bubbles head, great lacing on the glass.   Smell seems to be the medium in the most hoppy, resinous TH I've had (Julius), and the fruitier tropical Green. Soon as you crack the can, you get whiffs of peach, orange, tangerines and papaya. Then again you still get that slight resinous smell in the back end, reminiscent of marijuana and sweet malt. Besides the tropical fruit and hop resin I'm getting some nice honey as well.  Taste is an interesting blend of all the smells I got in the nose, tropical goodness like peaches, papaya and tangerines. But the most unique about Haze is its honey/sweet nectar quality. Definitely has a subtle sweet floral taste to it. Hop profile definitely isn't dominant. Sweet malt profile as well.  Mouthfeel doesn't come as a surprise. Not as much as a fruit dole feel like Green, but a more organic orange juice feel.  Overall, quite possibly my favorite TH I've had so far. Not as much of a fruity bomb as Green, not as much hop profile as Julius. Kind of the medium, like alter ego. But with a more honey/nectar flavor. Lovely beer.",0.6611442949801567,4.75,0.9877
Beer:Barrel:Time,"750ml bottle of the 2017 release. Served in a Side Project stemmed glass. Pour is a massively dark black body, one finger offwhite head, fair retention and no lacing as expected. Smell is rich. Really rich chocolate fudge, light smoke and bourbon, a lot of wet oak barrel and even a bit of vanillin, cocoa nibs, perhaps a little bit of espresso, sugar. It smells appropriately sweet. Flavour is a revelation; incredibly complex flavour profile of vanillin, oak, chocolate, cocoa, bourbon, slight char and smoke. This hits all the notes and very well it should. It's not particularly boozy, but the bourbon flavours just do so well in integrating with the stout. It's sweet, but doesn't taste sickly sweet. Mouthfeel is full bodied, substantial in body with a nice appropriate carbonation to it that is just enough without being overly prickly or flat. Tons of flavours from the beginning to the end, an easy one to ponder and sip on as it seems to change so much as it warms. There is a lot of hype behind this beer, and deservedly so. This checked off everything I could ever want in a non-adjunct, bourbon barrel-aged imperial stout.",0.6924598234351561,4.75,0.9876
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"'14 vintage, side by side with MD batch 2, SR-71 and yellow wax Assassin. Botlle generously shared by Chris at our Tasting to Sink all Sea Shepherds. Thanks a lot! A: Black, thick, sticks to the glass. Small, very dark head. Quite a good retention. S: Smell is awesome, maple, raisins, coffee, dark fruits, dried fruits and liquorice, all mixing very well together. Very strong and powerful nose. Quite intoxicating. T: Taste follows the nose with coffee, vanilla, tons of chocolate and dried fruits. Fudge and liquorice. Quite sweet and a bit of alcohol. Strong but not very lingering. M: Thick and viscous, sticking. Alcohol is felt. Heavy mouthfeel but still a good sipper. O: Very good stout, with an awesome smell, very good mix of flavors.",0.654098003926901,4.5,0.9876
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"On tap at DLD, finally! Brings me up to 95/100 on the Best of BA, but what a moving target that list is. Maybe I was a little drunk when I had this (ok, let's change that ""maybe"" to a ""definitely""), but this one really stopped me in my tracks and made me appreciate just what the hell I was drinking: one of the greatest beers of all time!  Pours as black as the BeerAdvocate website background, and as thick as Aunt Jemima syrup. A well-formed brown head sits on top and leaves some lacing on the glass...er...plastic cup.  The nose on this one is out of this world. So much going on. It smells like a rich chocolate cake, along with coffee, roastiness, candied fruits, oak, and bourbon. Even puts regular Dark Lord to shame here.  Flavor is similarly amazing. The sweetness of Dark Lord really mellows out with the oak aging. Lots of milk and dark chocolate, coffee, molasses, brown sugar, and candied plums and raisins. Oak and bourbon blend seamlessly and do not overwhelm in the least bit.  Incredibly full-bodied and rich on the palate. Carbonation level is medium-low, exactly as appropriate for a beer like this.  Overall, wow, this is unbelievably good. I'll knock it down a half-point on the drinkability just because it's so overwhelming, but as drunk and full as I was, I had no problem taking down the 6oz pour. (Wish it hadn't been so easy!) Hope I get to have this awesomeness again at some point in the future.",0.633244866062442,4.5,0.9876
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"A huge thanks to Mike for this one. 12oz. bottle shared with jbuddle and POTABLE83. #155/300 into Torst stemware. Reviewed from notes.   Pours a .25 finger dense, dark chocolate head with moderate retention. Beer is rich, thick and pitch black. Lacing is spotty and sparse with little cling. Probably the biggest, oiliest legs I've ever seen on a beer. Ever part of this screams imperial.   Nose is a hot fudge Sunday with a side of pancakes and bourbon maple syrup. Very aromatic. Outstanding.   Notes of maple syrup, chocolate, fudge, and molasses. Very chewy with loads of pancake and waffle and the slightest hint of bourbon that serves to complement the cornucopia of breakfast flavors perfectly. Now THIS is a breakfast stout if I've ever come across one. Finishes sweet and syrupy with a sticky, molasses and chocolate aftertaste. Phenomenal!   Full bodied with low carbonation. Slick and oily in the mouth and goes down smooth and viscous. Messy finish with a lingering aftertaste. Real drinkable for 13% but definitely a sipper.   This is easily one of the best and most unique imperial stouts I've ever had the opportunity to try. I'm not sure where Toppling Goliath came from but between this and Morning Delight, they have the market cornered on breakfast style imperial stout. Kentucky Brunch is simply amazing and I could drink this over and over and over again.",0.6706823108485979,4.75,0.9876
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"This is the most popular hefeweizen in my city. I love the big foamy head, carbonation, wheat aroma, & the fabulous lacing that these German Hefeweizens leave in a wheat beer glass. This is your starting off point of the top shelf German hefeweizens, you're getting great balance of flavor right here. This beer deserves a great balance in score just like the flavor that it brings. I notice a medium to heavy type of body with this beer. The banana, clove, cereal grains, garlic & wheat bread notes are showing themselves more sip after sip along with a bit of paprika spice. I'm grateful that I can always find a 6 pack of this classic wheat beer in my local beer stores everytime I go beer shopping. I recommend that if you want to session this beer do not eat a very heavy meal before doing so because hefeweizens are thick & filling much like a stout is. Cheers! A-",0.6211427002001068,4.25,0.9876
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2007 vintage  A-pours a bright ruby red color with an extremely light pink colored bubbly head.  S-the nose has a hint of earthy mushroom funk to it, light sweeter oak presence, the fruits are rather bright and the raspberry is seedy and fresh, it has a hint of tartness.  T-the taste is slightly muted in comparison to the nose. the acidity picks up in the finish and detracts from the brightness of the fresh raspberries. the funk is up front and well integrated with a note of oak and earthy flavors. the rapberry in back starts sweet but the acidity really presents a problem for it to push through.  M-medium bodied beer with a slightly syrupy feel to it and high carbonation with a very dry finish.  D-put up against many other lambics and sour raspberry ales, the acidity of some of these, including this one, take away from the juicy fruit flavors you get in the nose. the integration is done very well but this would probably be best drank fresh.  2004 Vintage drank 4/10  A-pours a completely hazed orangish amber color with an egg white head the is creamy and fluffy in appearance  S-the nose is tart and sour up front with notes of acidity, a touch of lactose and funk.

Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,"Incredible beer with plenty of influence from the Derivation. I really preferred it warmed up out of the bottle instead of ice cold on draught. Flavors and body all felt better. Isn't the thickest ba stout I've ever had but definitely seems to have a way better body than most of Jackie Os stouts (which is the only thing holding some of them back in my opinion). Flavors are a great mix of both. After having derivation 6 on tap the day of release, you definitely get a lot of that beer on the finish here. Dark app brings some roastiness in the front and cuts some of the overall sweetness. I wasn't sure how great it would be with the amount they made, but I'd easily put this up there with better ba souts I've had and It reminded me in some ways of the Black Magick beers.",0.6381291449824885,4.75,0.9875
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"I had this one at the 20th anniversary party of the Map Room in Chicago. Served on tap, I received about a 10oz pour into a short hourglass shaped glass.  A= Poured opaque and sporting a 1/4"" rich brown head. Once the glass was full this ale looked as black as motor oil. Once it was almost gone and the light got into it I could start to see traces of ruby and amber. By the way, I took the last sip and put the glass down and was amused to see that a lot of liquid still clung to the sides.   S= Huge complexity in the nose. Aside from the bourbon (which was giving me amazingly big and rich aromas), I noted heavy syrupy malt, roasted grain, some toffee-like richness, hints of coffee, and alcohol. Not overpowering or solvent-y in any way though.  T= My God, it was amazing. This beer was custom made for a bourbon barrel. Often times I thing the bourbon barrel overpowers a beer. Not the Dark Lord. Things started off with the best parts of bourbon (sweet complexity) plus vanilla, roasted grain, coffee, toffee, and an almost indescribable richness that was not heavy or cloying despite the ten ton weight of this beer. It was a sipping experience for sure, but I never felt that it was overwhelming. The hops were pretty much non-existent. The finish was smooooth, warm with a pleasant alcohol, and sweet.  MF= Beyond heavy body...it's in a class by itself. When I had finished it, there was enough liquid sticking to the sides of the glass to make the glass look brown for a few seconds and allow me another small sip (and lots of aroma for a long time after the experience was over). Carbonation was there but otherwise not really a factor.  D= Despite the 15% abv, despite the syrupy thick body, despite the sweetness, this beer was really a joy to experience and ultimately the drinkability was high. Unexpectedly high. A moving experience that I will not hesitate to repeat.",0.6734111929409867,5.0,0.9875
Society & Solitude #4,"750ml growler thanks to Huhzubendah!  A - Pours a a mirky golden orange color, white frothy head, sticky lace, thick collar, and some wisps on top.  S - Big mango & tropical fruit sweetness up front on the nose along with some citrus and pine that quickly follow. The hops are there, big time, but the fruit & citrus help balance things out very nicely...not overpowering (which I prefer).  T - Grassy, tropical fruit sweetness, some earth, pine. A little more dank then the nose and the hops are showcased here a bit more. There still a nice orange citrus peel note here as well. Alcohol is there, ever so slightly for 8%. Finish is super-bitter pine & resin.  M - Medium body, good carbonation, oily bitter finish.  O - A really nice DIPA that makes two special beers combine into one. I have to say, I'm a fan of the Galaxy DIPA over this beer, but prefer this one over Double Citra. That said, it's all meaningless chatter because this beer is very enjoyable and I will be drinking more in the very near future. Cheers!",0.6673141274383919,4.5,0.9875
Peche 'n Brett,"A: Pours a hazed burnt apricot flavor with a tightly carbonated two finger white head. This bottle was not a gusher, which was cool. Didn't want any of this to go to waste.   S: My favorite part of the beer. This stuff smells fantastic. Right away, you get the advertised peach, but it's not the sweet, juicy peach puree kind of smell I was expecting. It's a tart underripe white peach aroma blanketed by some bretty funk. There is definitely a touch of sweetness there, but the barnyard funk really keeps things from getting too sweet. A great dash of oak, spice and just waves and waves of funk. I love this smell.  T: Opens with a tart note of peach and peach skin with a trace of underripe raspberry peeking through. A big wave of barnyard funk follows and it leaves a dry, tannic feel on your tongue. Soft oak, brett, peach pit and chalky malt. Everything is really well balanced and the peaches are a great addition. Mouthfeel is medium with some tight carbonation that allows all of the flavors to come through without being too distracting. The slightest bit of warmness on the swallow is the only trace of the 10%. A really well done beer.",0.6478334535742547,4.5,0.9875
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"Pours a mostly opaque dark cola brown. Two fingers of dense tan head recedes to an oily collar that leaves minimal lacing. Smell is [surprise] dominated by bourbon and maple. Some molasses and dark chocolate come through as well.  Taste highlighted by sweet maple, vanilla, and smooth roasted chocolate malt. Just enough black coffee and bittersweet chocolate to give it some balance and prevent it from being too sweet. Bourbon is certainly present, but not boozy. It adds a pleasant spicy warmth. Faint oak and molasses notes also present. Body is a bit thinner than I anticipated, but it doesn't detract much from the impressive medley of flavors.  I thought it could have been better with a fuller body, but it is fantastic nonetheless. Maybe closer to the bottom of my pecking order in Jackie O's BA offerings, but that's still better than most. Would not hesitate to buy another.",0.6750191231847179,4.25,0.9875
Sip Of Sunshine,"Golden and slightly cloudy, with a little carbonation. A little white foam of a head.  Smells of caramel, pine, citrus, and Amarillo hops. Hints of tropical fruits like pineapple.  Amazing. Full of tropical fruits, none of them distinguishable. Its like the fruitiness has become as one with the Amarillo, and citrusy hops. Feels like only a slight bitterness on the end for all the hops, but it has a wonderfully fruity, floral, pine, and citrusy balance. Hints of black pepper at times.  Amazing balance. Slightly syrupy body, with a very light, foamy carbonation.  Amazing. Balance to perfection. Great day in Vermont.

Darkstar November,"Appearance: poured jet black with a highly viscous looking consistency. The head was bright brown that vanished quickly. No lacings around glass.   Aroma: very intoxicating notes of bourbon with a bite of rye and raisins. Then comes in strong notes of oak and chocolate liqueur. Very decadent and rich.   Taste: upon the first sip, the bourbon comes in strong and almost harsh with notes of raisins up front. It's quickly followed by a blend of molasses, chocolate, and oak. A very sweet, decadent desert beer that is finished with a slight burn and taste of char.   Mouthfeel: full-bodied, sticky and rich in the mouth  Overall: at step down from Fundamental Observation (only other Bottle Logic I have tried) but still an awesome beer. The molasses and rye really add a burnt sweetness and bite to the beer. For anyone who loves bourbon straight up, this is a great choice.",0.6872610102048932,4.5,0.9875
Juicy," bottle. Batch 2, bottled 10/10/2015. Served in a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass 1/26/2016.  Pours a medium copper body, slight golden hue, two finger white head with the perfect amount of retention, appropriate amount of lacing for the style. It's a nice looking beer. Smells of orange rind, musty oak, mild white grape, lemon, a bit of vinegar, cereal. It smells fairly musty and acetic at first, but as it warms up, the orange rind component definitely comes out a bit more, which definitely brings the descriptor ""juicy"" to mind. Very nice! Flavour is a combination of grape must, orange flesh, chardonnay, mild cereal grain, minerals, with a mild lemon peel bitterness and light oak astringency on the backend. Mouthfeel is phenomenal, with a medium body, good carbonation, a slight slickness to it that coats your mouth in that orange flesh flavour before giving way to a bit of lemon bitterness. It's particularly dry. It's definitely best served at cellar temperature. Anyway, this is very tasty with a nice 'juicy' aroma and a fairly complex hoppy and funky flavour profile. As a hoppy saison without fruit additions, there probably isn't much out there that's better than this.",0.7062855838723995,4.5,0.9874
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"28-04-2010 stamped on the label. ""Good for at least ten years after the bottling date."" Well, I can't drop this much money on a beer to not drink it for 10 years.   Poured into a Mikkeller oversized wine glass.   Appearance This kriek has such a deep color. Its beet red with no clarity. The pink head fades quickly. No lacing, and really not even a collar.   Aroma WOW, there's that amazing Fonteinen funk! Such a stinky awesome aroma. A LOT of horseblanket and goat cheese. Some cat piss and cow manure is mixed in there. It pretty much smells exactly like a stable. If you wanted to know what reviewers mean by horseblanket, look no further than this beer. Cherries come out with gentle swirling. It smells like sour cherry pits, stems and skins.   Taste Sourness is not big by any means, in fact, this is basically just as tart as a sour cherry. Lots of old cellar, damp oak, funky yeast sour cherry skins and pits comprise this complex flavor profile. The cherries are merely an accent, not the main attraction. But they really come alive on the finish and lingering aftertaste. They allow the lambic to remain raw, funky and unsweetened.   Mouthfeel Very low carbonation, but what's there teams up with the gentle pucker and high acidity to create a lively beer. The body is surprisingly thick and a little slick.   Overall  This is darn good. I love the funky aroma most of all. This beer's acidity is high, thus making it one to take slowly.",0.6772981963262878,4.0,0.9874
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Review #300. From 6/2/10 notes. Had at a Three Floyds tasting at the Brickskeller in DC. This was a 2009 Dark Lord vintage aged in whiskey barrels.  a - Pours a pure black color with little head and carbonation.  s - Smells of whiskey, oak, and maybe a little vanilla. Also some sweet malts.  t - Tastes of whiskey, oak, sweet dark fruits, and vanilla. Has a touch of heat to it.  m - Medium to full body and low carbonation.  d - I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. I'm a big fan of whiskey and oak in stouts, and this one was great. Also enjoyed the sweetness in the smell and taste. Very interested to open one of my bottles of regular DL now to compare the two, and would love to try again some day. ___  Edit: Got to try this again on tap at Dark Lord Day at the brewery on 04/30/11 and liked it a lot more than the first time I had it. I thought the nose was absolutely amazing; the bourbon and vanilla really shone through. Bumping the nose from a 4.5 to a 5.0.",0.6090686573558461,5.0,0.9874
Chocolate Rain,"No head and very minimal scattered lace marks on a very deep brown but light getting through body. Aroma is dominated by milk chocolate and oak barrels and bourbon. Hint of vanilla. Flavor as my good friend describes it is more chocolate like than actual chocolate almost like a chocolate typhoon more than a chocolate rain. Obviously dark and milk chocolate dominate with large amounts if vanilla, coconut and brown sugar. The sweetness is really too much. Even as you drink this one it doesn't get any easier to bare the sweetness with the alcohol and bourbon taking a back seat even to how sweet it is. Full body and light carbonation, very smooth. Good but way too sweet for me. Glad I tired it.",0.6352856446242598,4.25,0.9874
Juicy,"This is my first beer review, and to be honest, it is only because it is necessary. I have never felt the need to give my input on a beer except while bartending or during a bottle share, until now.  The smell is a deep brett funk with a small hint of tartness. The initial taste is huge brett, slightly bitter. It finishes like taking a huge bite out of a Florida orange on a hot summer day at the beach with the best of friends. Both bottles i have had were not gushers, and although this was not thr best beer i have ever tasted, it was the most interesting and pleasant one by far.  Enjoy, and happy hunting.",0.6126754174265014,5.0,0.9873
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Bottled 4/28/10 so a little over a year old. One of the first of many beers at an awesome tasting last weekend. Thanks to cbutova for sharing this pricey treat!  Pours murky magenta, pink head barely forms before fizzing away. Flecks left behind instead of lace.  Big lemon juice funkiness and sour cherry in the nose, great scent.  Sour, sweaty lemon funk, cherries and maybe raspberries, vinegar notes. Fruit is a bit more subtle in the taste than in the smell.  Nice, puckering, well-carbonated mouthfeel. Good.  A great sour, though as usual I wish the cherries were a bit stronger. Really nice funk though and very drinkable considering the style.",0.6388962090514169,4.5,0.9873
Enjoy By IPA,"Poured from 22oz bottle into Bell's Hopslam Tulip, this is the Enjoy By 4-20-17 bottled on March 14th 2017.   L: Bright , clear gold. Beautiful fluffy off-white head that has some excellent retention.   S: Grapefruit, dank pine, leaf tobacco. Smells super clean if that makes sense. Refreshing to the point that having this after work seems brilliantly relaxing.   T: The grapefruit takes a back seat, the dankness of the pine shines out well. Leafy hop also shines strong too, this is very refreshing. Really impressive flavors.   F: Medium body, good carbonation that's crisp. Some hop oils remain on the tongue. Semi-dry but in this case its nice.   O: Wow this is just an impressive beer. Stone continues to blow me away.  Update: Got my hands on the next batch, Enjoy by 5/29 (Memorial Day) tasting this on 5/3/17, bottled on 4/22/17 so only 11 days old.   L: Same.   S: Same.  T: Same.  F: Would change this from semi-dry to very dry but that might just be this batch.",0.6469197105681729,4.75,0.9873
Black Tuesday,"Well, lets just do it. Pouring a 2016 bottle from a 750 ml. into a tulip glass. This beer poured surprisingly lighter in color than most of similar style. It had medium brown highlights throughout the whole pour. Forms in the glass dark, but even still with highlights around all edges. It formed a very thin and incomplete crown that was light tan in color. The smell is hot and boozy with big dark fruit notes like raisins, plums and figs. The taste comes in with those dark fruit notes again but now providing some cherry like element as well. It is definitely warm, but less than would ever be expected from a 40 proof bourbon barrel aged imperial stout. Finishes with that warmness mixing with some nice chocolate notes. Honestly though, I'm a little let down on the amount of flavor being delivered. Overall, this wasn't bad but I've definitely had better from the Bruery. I will give them the achievement of making a 40 proof stout that is drinkable as hell and the ABV that hidden tho.",0.6616068625359293,4.0,0.9873
Swish,"From 16oz can into tulip. Pours a beautiful soft orange lemonade, with a minimal, but nice white head composed of larger than average bubbles. Nice ring remains around the circumference when the head dissipates.   The aroma of this beer is likely to invoke a smile. It’s a light tropical adventure headed by pineapple with floral hop fragrances. There is no malt in the odor, and it is very refreshing; lofty, pure, and without even a hint of aggression.   Feel is certainly juicy, though nicely integrated with the sharp micro-bubbles to give it some structure; it foams up a bit on the swallow.   The taste begins like a fruit juice, predominately pineapple with some citrus flavors. Resolves into a little mango and grapefruit, and then finishes slightly more on the citrus side—grapefruit and lemon is what I get—with a very light bit of lingering malty something. Grapefruit lingers as well. This is a primo NE double and certainly top notch. Juicy, drinkable, and impressive.",0.7119284327055221,5.0,0.9873
Mastermind,"A: Soapy, white, 1/4 finger head. The liquid is a soft orange-y color. Opaque with a very slight haze. Though murky, it is definitely an attractive beer.   S: Tropical and juicy. It jumped from the can as I was pouring it, before I even put my nose in. TONS of pineapple for me. Mango. Grapefruit starts to emerges as it sits a couple minutes. A perfect malt sweetness lies beneath to compliment the juicy aromas. I could smell this forever.   T: Juice from nose pops as expected. Pineapple and grapefruit dominate until the malty sweetness swoops in for a perfect balance. The tropical, juicy notes linger and are overtaken at just the right time by the malt. The fade is near perfect. If that's not enough, the beer finishes with the PERFECT amount of lingering bitterness. This beer is so well made and so well layered.   F: Light and so drinkable for a DIPA. Falls right off the palate. Just so damn drinkable. Not much to complain about.   O: Best DIPA I've had in quite some time. From the appearance, to the nose, to the taste...it delivers. Not really sure what else I could ask of this beer. It was the perfect IPA for my mood and palate. So well made/balanced. So drinkable that it disappeared out of the glass too quickly. Will certainly seek this one out again.",0.6876944376443145,4.75,0.9872
Oude Geuze Vintage,"375 ml bottle, bottled on March, 10, 2008, poured into a tulip glass.  A- Pours a clear bright gold color, topped with a two-inch fizzy white head, it recedes to about a finger thick and then hangs around really nicely, leaves lots of lacing.  S- Awesome aroma, lot of earthy funk, notes of mushroom and wet wood. Leather oak and vanilla are also noticable. Nice amount of tartness with lemon and fruit. The aroma is really nice and has some of the best earthy funk character that I've had in a while.  T- Very bracing acidity with lemon and sour apple, complex barnyard funk, very earthy with lots of wet wood and hints of chalk, leather, vanilla and oak. Has a bit of fruity and malty sweetness towards the finish.  M- Light-bodied, smooth crisp feel, smooth feel with a dry, tannic finish.  O- A delicious gueuze, the flavors are complex and well-blended. This is a phenomenal beer and another testament to Armand's masterful skill, this beer only falls short of Armand'4 in terms of the best gueuzes I've ever had.",0.7074897927770867,5.0,0.9872
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"A good barrel aged stout but I'd still prefer regular expedition due to the barrel whiskey flavors taking over the chocolate coffee flavors that shine in regular expedition, however both are better choices than blacknote. Funny blacknote stands above, must be the rarity.  This one has strong bourbon barrel forward flavors along with subtle coffee and chocolate. There's some oakiness, toffee, and tobacco as well with hints of vanilla. With a $9 a bottle price tag I will stick to regular expedition and never come back to this unless given to me as a gift. Nevertheless it's definitely worth seeking out, highly recommended, and glad I got to try it.",0.6096406769253521,4.5,0.9871
Chocolate Rain,"Bottle from dak. Thanks! 2013 bottle (I think) shared with beastmaster. Pours dark brown (thin looking) with no head whatsoever. Big vanilla chocolate nose with huge sweet bourbon and a bit of licorice and woody oak. Big thick mouthfeel, velvety, with low carbonation but not flat. Big burnt sugar and molasses up front, with sweet chocolate syrup on the back end. Bourbon booze burns on the time. Packs quite a flavor punch. Serious sipper with a lingering sweetness that is rather pleasant. Starts great, harsh going down and waaaay sweet, then the linger is fantastic after dinner treat. Age might do this well for that middle portion which makes it tough to deal with more than a small pour (5 oz here). Only two of us, so recapping the rest for tomorrow.",0.6341217842778213,4.0,0.9871
Black Tuesday,"Split with JLindros poured into a Kate the Great tulip.  A - Poured a very nice dark black hue with a quarter inch tan head that left light lacing, solid.  S - Aromas of chocolate, bourbon, sweet malts heaven, so so good.  T - Taste is chocolatey, bourbon, super hot bourbon, vanilla, barrel, sweet malts, support delicious.  M - Mouthfeel is rather hot but the carbonation is spot on, very drinkable, got but not oppressive.  O - Overall I loved this beer, really awesome but super hot still.

Enjoy By IPA,"Rating an Enjoy by 12.25.15... bottled on 11/18/15 *First 'Enjoy by' for this fella. Pretty stoked.  Eyes: A light golden color. Poured with a 3 finger head. About a 4 minute retention.   Nose: Pine, mango, tangerines, hibiscus, white grape. Very sweet and herbaceous.   Taste: Very sweet. Honey syrupy goodness. Grains of paradise is prominent (even if it wasn't used). Coriander and lemon zest on the back end.  Body/Feels: Thinner than I thought. Sticky and boozy. Although the 9.4% is masked very well. I would have pinned it closer to 8%.  Overall: I was hoping it would be a little more on the piney/bitter end of the IPA spectrum. But for being on the other side, its very good. You can't go wrong with a stone IPA, and the Enjoy by Series seems to be top-shelf, and decently priced. If you're an experienced beer (IIPA) consumer, this won't knock your hops off. But its tasty, refreshing, and damn good.   Peace",0.6670304475624166,3.75,0.9871
Chocolate Rain,"2015 bottle Poured from the bomber into a snifter.  No head on the pour but it pours viscous like a dessert liqueur. The color is dark brown with amber hues. Laciness over the body. 3.75  Barleywine meets imperial stout. Very thick with malt of the chocolate and caramel variety but also raisin-y. Oatmeal cookie and tobacco and barrel aromas. 4.25  Maple syrup like flavor with a bold oak taste and rich chocolate. Vanilla and cocoa join the mix. Lots of sweet flavors swirl into a syrupy flavor. 4.25  Yeah, it's syrupy and sweet, viscous and almost entirely lacking in carbonation. Approaches a digestif in feel. 4  Tasty but man, this is sweet and syrupy.",0.6365672507567071,4.25,0.9871
Chocolate Rain,"2012 bottling, 750ml bottle split into snifters with my brothers - much thanks to Sean for this one -  A: Can't figure out how this is possible but it isn't even close to opaque...dark brown pour with ruby highlights...nearly no head but epic alcohol legs. Still looks good.  S: Huge boozy dark fruits here, lots of rum-soaked raisin character...smoothed-out caramel and lots of vanilla...big bourbon tones...lots of chocolate character too after you get used to the vanilla and boozy dark fruits.  T: Milk chocolate like a boss...chocolate and vanilla liqueur...dark caramel and burnt residual sugars...bourbon sweetness...booziness is apparent but totally manageable, the warmth is actually pretty nice and cuts some of the sweetness...  MF: Very low carbonation, moderate warmth from the booze, viscous and full-bodied...this is the epitome of a sipping beer.  O: Pretty awesome, as you get used to all of the boozy characters (dark fruits, vanilla, caramel, and bourbon) the chocolate is pretty epic in this thing. Totally recommended if you can snag one.",0.6481305816269354,4.5,0.9871
Juicy,"Out of my Ommegang glass.  A- A beautiful warm orangey amber color. Pours with a nice foamy white head and plenty of lacing. Pretty crisp and clean.  S- A strong smell of funky bret, tangerine, and peachy fruity smells. Wow!  T- the initial flavor is very funky and bretty , it quickly transitions to more of a peppery saison flavor. The aftertaste is nice fruity hops with touches of orange and lemon rind. Definitely a baby mimosa of sorts.  M- as always from Hill Farmstead it is spot on.  O- the diversity in flavor is just incredible. If you love funky bretty beers, this should be a must have. The citrus and hops just compliment each other extremely well.",0.6725453328948919,5.0,0.9871
Very GGGreennn,"L - been waiting for this one... Green, arguably Tree House's best beer, and the stutters and Very's that follow seem hard to top. This should be the top, right? Pours a hazed-up Green. Starts dark on the top and lightens up down toward the bottom. Hard to tell if that's the reflection of the can, but I'm getting a radioactive swamp monster vibe. Milky gradient of yellow to deep orange with some serious head fluff. Lacing clings to the glass, but the oily foam remains, jiggling like jell-o.  S - massive, earthy, penetrating aroma. Starts with that classic pineapple creamsicle and evolves into a doughy, melony, juicy-fruity hop bomb. Ripe and sticky, yet clean and sugar-free. Kiwi and strawberries play a supporting role. This is Green in every essence of its being. Strong Monson nostalgia vibes.  T - zoinks. This hits me as if Green were a liquor. It's not boozey, but it has the potent warmth and zip of something that lights up your insides. Don't misunderstand, this is not acidic or overly bitter, this is pure Green concentrate. Initial sensation is a quick bite, then melts into the softest pineapple orange vanilla sherbet creamsicle. Smoothies on top of smoothies, with quite a range of flavors from kiwi to strawberry to banana. Tropical and pithy. Stringy pineapple. Danimals yogurt smoothies. Wheaty Galaxy crackers. Notes from GGG in the form of sweetness (sans sugariness) and fruity berries, but also Very vibes with its mealy, yeasty tanginess. Coats the mouth with hop residue and as the flavor continues to wash over me gullet long after my sip, bitterness sets in. Subtle at first, it tingles louder and louder into a Green electric current that sits on the tongue, eating away at it. Finishes vaguely doughy in Green fashion, finally ending with that burnt-out feeling you get from housing freeze pops until your face hurts. This is a fruit bomb and palate destroyer in one.  F - strangely not up to par compared to the other variants. I mean, it's still a life-changing experience like running naked through a field of giant dandelions and puppies, but doesn't have the ""heft"" I was looking for. But here I am, nit-picking an otherwise amazing beer. You'll still see high marks here.  O - very rarely do I take a sip of beer that forces me to put the glass down and exclaim the profane. There is so much going on in that first sip, so I highly recommend this on a fresh palate. Feels like a Green montage or clip show at hyperspeed like the ending scene of 2001. I just witnessed Green as a baby, growing up and peaking at an old age like George Clooney.",0.6539981482857298,5.0,0.9871
Haze,"Split a can of this with my roommate and good friend Chris, who snagged it as a trade from his work buddy. Cheers Chris! I've had the privilege of having several Tree House beers in the past, but not this one as far as I recall (I think I'd probably remember having this if I did).  Pours an opaque orange color as expected with a very retentive bone-white head of foam that sticks around at about a finger with some splotchy lace here and there. The head that remains is very consistent and the surface of the beer bears it quite well. Not everyone is into these turbid ""milkshake"" looking IPAs, but if you are, this is certainly a nice looking one.  Very clean and well-defined hop profile that straddles the line between tropical and citrusy hops very closely. Not much malt here at all other than a subtle wheaty backbone that nevertheless fades behind the hop qualities. I get a lot of peach, orange, grapefruit peel, papaya, mango and even some ripe blueberry in here. Kind of seems like Mosaic combined with some older school hops to me. A tad bit of doughy yeast in there as well.  On the tongue, this is super bright with candied citrus, mango, papaya and other tropical fruits up front followed closely by some more citrus and even a little pine towards the finish as a slight bitterness takes hold. I'm surprised this doesn't drink like an 8+% beer at all; it's very drinkable and even ""crushable"" although the idea of crushing this is almost blasphemous to me. Pure orange juice in the middle, with some peach and apricot flavors lingering a bit before the mostly dry close. I say mostly dry because there's a slight flash of juiciness even right at the end, alongside a tough and lingering bitterness. Just great.  Drinkability is, of course, very high as well. These guys don't really know how to make a bad IPA, and the combination of heavy amounts of suspended proteins in the final product and oats in the mash give this a soft, smooth feel with a moderate carbonation and chewy body. This doesn't drink anywhere close to 8%, as stated before, so the alcohol presence is fairly muted and doesn't really play into the flavor until the glass gets closer to room temperature. Even then, it's hardly as present as many other lower-ABV DIPAs out there right now. Simply world-class. Love it.",0.6859254717627654,4.75,0.987
Peche 'n Brett,"My first Logsdon's beer that really didn't gush after cracking it. Gorgeous cloudy orange juice color with fine, scattered beading. An appropriate finger of bone white head forms pinpoint lacing and noticeable booze legs before settling back to form a thin cap on the beer. Absolutely stunning just to look at.  Bold, semisweet peach explodes from the glass. Floral, incredibly fresh fruit flesh melded with sour white grape, pear skins and a mildly acidic citrus quality.  Wow. I really didn't know what to expect on the palate... Like nothing else I can think of... It's a work of art. Bright orange and peach flavors collide with dry funky Brett, fresh oak and juicy pear.  Wonderfully soft velvet consistency provides the perfect vehicle for the flavors described.  Big thanks to harrymel for this gem!",0.7004209709879251,4.75,0.987
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Poured from 12 oz into a bourbon county snifter  A- pitch black with virtually no head. What little head there is disappears into nothing very quickly.   S- deep rich notes of roast, huge boozy bourbon followed by rich coffee. There is a subtle maple scent that follows the coffee in the back.  T- oh my god. Heat from the bourbon sits up front and hits your palate like spartans against the persians. Then a shot of espresso covers your mouth and melds deliciouslu with the bourbon and the sweet vanilla, oak barrel. Lastly, after the swallow there's a strong maple presence that sits in your mouth for a long time and it develops and lasts for a long time and you don't want it to go away. Strong chocolate and vanilla notes also seep in during the mix. There is only one beer that beats this on taste.   M- thick, creamy, velvety. The way a stout should feel. No carbonation. Completely coats your mouth and throat all the way down.  O- one of the best stouts i've every had. The flavors blend perfectly and each flavor is detectable. It's amazingly delicious. I wish i had an infinite amount of this.",0.6679760228111592,5.0,0.987
Haze,"Appearance - Pours cloudy pulpy orange color, looks like a glass of orange juice. Nice white head great lacing.  Smell - Mango, orange peel, grapefruit, pineapple and peach. The hops are coming through nicely as well.  Taste - Very juicy topical IPA sweet and very nice hop flavor. The best way I can describe this is someone added fresh hops to freshly squeezed juice. Amazing flavors and very well balanced. Plenty of orange and pineapple as well as mango papaya and grapefruit. This is dangerously drinkable and no sign of the 8.2% ABV.  Feel - Medium body very smooth. Although it is medium body it still has very full and creamy feel.  Overall - This is an amazing brew, it hits all the notes from the tropical smell and taste to the well balanced hoppiness and smooth feel.",0.7010028911436942,4.75,0.9869
Swish,"Had this on 2015-04-27 in Columbia, PA from a fresh 16 oz can.  A - Hazy golden-yellow with a 1.5 finger white head and moderate lace.  S - Orange, grapefruit and pineapple flesh in copious amounts. Huge tropical aroma. Moderately dank but not over-the-top. Little if any malt. Certainly a nice platform to showcase the hops.  T - Very balanced. There's some cracker flavor cushioning the fruit and hops. I can't discern the three types of citrus aromas noted in the smell but they blend together in a most agreeable way; plus some peach that I didn't pick up in the aroma. There's just a bit of herbal spice and some pepper. It finishes very dry and balanced with long-lasting but not tongue-numbing bitterness.  M - Medium body and light-medium carbonation. Pretty resinous and somewhat prickly.  O - This is one fine DIPA. It's not as bright as Lawson's Double Sunshine; my all time favorite but this rates right up there with the best of the Northeast-style DIPAs.",0.6971823177593643,4.25,0.9869
Sip Of Sunshine,"Poured into a Tulip glass. Served at 55 degrees.  Appearance: Poured a beautiful gold, orange, yellow hued body, very reminiscent of a soft colored light bulb. Little head at first, give the can a nice spin towards the bottom and mix the yeast, the head will be a solid 1 finger, and will slowly disappear.  Smell: Very simcoe-ish, smells of mango, pineapple, peaches, oranges, mild spice, fresh baked bread.  Taste: This is Vermont meets Nor. Cal in a glass taste wise, tastes of fresh blueberries, cotton candy grapes, california oranges, pineapple, mango, it tastes clean like Vermont air.  Feel: Again, it's VT/CA in a glass, it reminds me of drinking softened water from my uncle's farms. It's soft, silky, sweet, dry to finish, and comes back up the nose inviting for another sip.  Overall: This is the perfect beer to me and this outbeats heady topper. This feels like a proper beer, the body is satisfying, the alcohol is ridiculously hidden, it's perfectly balanced.",0.6642827803567773,5.0,0.9868
Peche 'n Brett,"Drank from a 1 pint, 9.4 fl. oz./750 ml wax dipped bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA Bottle No. 20430 Best by: 10/2020 Served in a tulip  Beautiful appearance. The hazy, golden-amber liquid was capped by a billowing, four-finger tall, bright white, fluffy mass. Large clumps of Brussels-style lacing cascaded down the glass. The head slowly dropped to a thick, frothy film.  The aroma was somewhat underwhelming. A super crisp, dry, powdery yeasty quality was balanced by subtle peach notes. Bright and lively. Slightly floral. A bit jasmine tea-like. The nose was also moderately tart and brett-y. Slightly funky. As the beer sat, the peach subsided and the yeastiness intensified. Dry, tannic, oaky notes also came through big time. Later, the peach reappeared.  The flavor profile was super dry and tannic. Fairly bitter as well. There was a subtle fruity quality on the front end and a touch of malty sweetness, but this was quickly washed away by tart, brett-y notes and a crisp, dry, powdery yeastiness. The beer was also really oaky and tannic. Lemon rind appeared on the back end and carried into the finish. Moderately bitter with a hint of earthy, aged hops. The oaky barrel notes again came through strong. Super tannic and dry. Almost a bit astringent. As the beer sat, subtle fruity notes appeared. Though the flavor profile was rather unrefined, the alcohol was barely noticeable.  The mouthfeel was medium bodied. Soft and creamy. This almost seemed a bit undercarbonated. The liquid contained a fine, frothy effervescence that tuned smooth and supple on the palate.  I really enjoyed Logsdon's Seizoen Bretta and Oak Aged Bretta but found this beer to be overly dry, tannic and one-dimensional. Even though I opened this bottle only a few months after cellaring it, the peach was hardly noticeable. Looking at many of the reviews here on BA, my only guess would be that this was stored for a while before being distributed. That said, I would love to revisit a fresher bottle someday.",0.7102749985556659,3.75,0.9868
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"This one pours a fairly dark black, with a small head, and not much lacing.  This smells quite hot and spicy on the nose ,with earthy and spicy cinnamon, sweet bourbon, oak, and a little bit of vanilla.  Like most Jackie O's beer, this flies way under the radar but is utterly delicious. There is a super killer cinnamon character to this- it's perfect- present but not overbearing. I don't get much of the base walnut character, but there's some nice biting pepper character, some light bourbon, and a hint of vanilla. The base is nice and chocolatey as well.  This is medium bodied, not super thick, but definitely not thin in any way.",0.670345585748136,4.5,0.9868

Great balance from the dry hopping makes the citrus powerful but overpowering. Pine, citrus peel big flavors.

The aroma has a nice crisp tartness to it with hints of sour apples, vinous grapes and lemon. Acidic and woody with a little bit of basement must. Sour and tart with apple sweetness and a nice tart lemon flavor. Woody notes with a nice funky background.   Nice and light on the body with good carbonation. Overall this one is great. Wonderfully drinkable.",0.7000745111881117,4.5,0.9868
Sip Of Sunshine,"This is a delicious beer.  The look is gold, almost opaque, but little transparency with a decent one finger head in my case.  Smells is fruity, more on the orange side with a faint booziness The taste is bitter, as expected. Has a very juicy taste and too me on the grapefruit side with an earthy aftertaste.  Feel is smooth, balanced and full   Overall this is a great introduction to the double IPA, and an even better summer beer. 15$ for a four pack seemed high for a novice like me, but with such a high ABV, and a great taste, you can't go wrong. These are best reserved for celebration or hanging out on the beach.  Cheers!",0.6946728596076361,4.5,0.9868
Society & Solitude #4,"On draft at Three Penny Taproom. Served in tulip.  A= A light orange hazy pour with a foamy head that is just barely off-white. Sticky lacing.  S= Big citrus aroma, mostly orange juice, zest, and pith. Some tropical notes in the background but orange is quite powerful.  T= Tons of juicy fruit goodness. Orange juice still strong in the flavor, mango, tropical fruits, some grapefruit hints. Super tasty.  M= Moderate carbonation, medium body.  O= This may be my new favorite from HF. So fresh and inviting. Aroma and flavor are top notch. Juicy as can be.",0.6637470654725427,4.75,0.9867
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Appearance - pours thick black with big fluffy mocha colored head that settles slowly to a huge thick ring. Great retention sheets of lacing very nice for the ABV.  Aroma - Wow huge bourbon aroma, lots of barrel, sweet and bitter chocolate, rich vanilla, fudge.  Taste - Tons of barrel, great bourbon flavor, lot of chocolate and fudge, light tobacco, roasted malts. Excellent bourbon flavor but none of the alcohol big flavors.  Feel - Really thick creamy chewy mouthfeel,, nice warming from the alcohol smooth and velvety.  Overall - Very well done, lots of depth nice balance in the flavors just superb.",0.6870927019637072,4.75,0.9867
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"shared a 75cl bottle at Nüetnigenough (Brussels, Belgium)  Lou Pepe Framboise is to a double-pound cheeseburger what Rosé De Gambrinus would be to a quarter-pounder; both delight and amaze in their own right, but one is definitely a richer more intense version of the other.   An abundance of raspberry on the nose, with the good ol' barnyard funk we've come to expect and love from the magic of the River Senne. Lots of tart, dark berry, and even a little bit of oak emerge from the bottle once the cork comes off; a sour lemon-y residue lingers while the bottle decants.  Sour isn't usually my go-to response with Framboise, but it is in this case. The nose is wonderfully matched on the tongue as well, as funky sour hay flavors quickly follow the tart dark fruit. I'd even dare to say that the berry flavor is closer to cranberry than it is to raspberry; remind me to mix this with vodka if I ever find myself holding an excess supply.",0.6317943798895161,4.75,0.9867
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Sampled this many times at Dark Lord Day the past few years. Always arrives in the plastic cup, but that doesn't detract from this massive brew. Impenetrable black, oily, viscous and thick with a layer of deep dark tan foam on top. Looks like 10K+ mile used motor oil. Aromas reek of deep dark malts with notes of coffee and chocolate all drenched in a wonderful, woody bourbon that jumps out of the cup to greet you. It's really hard to describe but it all comes together perfectly and the aroma is divine.  Sipping this brings you immediate warmth as the big, dense malts collide with the rich bourbon and wood notes. Chocolate, caramel, coffee and molasses all work in as it flows down. The brew is on the sweeter side but never becomes too sweet as it's nicely balanced with a solid bitterness. Finishes with lingering bourbon notes. Simply amazing.  Mouthfeel is big, viscous, chewy and heavy. It's so damn good, albeit a bit hard to drink when you are standing out in the sun. After the tasting tables, a cup of this is usually what does me in every Dark Lord Day. Still, given the chance I would drink this until I fell down. Spectacular stuff that I look forward to every year!",0.6724093426020393,4.5,0.9866
Space Trace,"This beer is throwing me for a loop. Second time I am trying space trace but first time writing a review and it tastes more like FO than a chocolate coconut beer. Pours thick and dark with a good amount of carbonation for the style. Leaves a layer of foam covering the surface of the beer. You get an overwhelming vanilla note on the nose. A little bit of chocolate on the back end and a generally sweet character. Coconut doesn’t really stand out however. The taste is sweet and balanced and follows the nose with chocolate becoming more prevalent as it warms. A touch too carbonated for the style but not overtly so. Another hit from bottle logic. Nice barrel, sweet, balanced and utterly delicious.",0.6832919046830108,5.0,0.9866
Sip Of Sunshine,"Can Date: 9/30/16 Palate Contaminants: other beer  Appearance is a pleasant clear gold with a moderate amount of head. The glow is really nice.  The smell starts with marmalade and malt. The malt sweetness is accompanied by some cedar. It might be a little woody, but it's actually savory overall.  The taste has a base of malty candy. The main shades are sweet and savory, and bitter just adds a little color (which is usually where I prefer it). Other than the orange from the marmalade, I also get subdued lemon and papaya. Sweeter fruits like nectarines come and go. The white wood and pine are still there, but not strong.  For something with this much sweetness – though not a sugar bomb – it's not sticky like Boston Lager can be. The carbonation is well integrated, and the savoriness and sweetness that characterize the flavor remain in the aftertaste.  I'm glad I tracked it down, but it's still behind Pliny and Hopslam for me. (Not like there's any detriment in that.) Still, I like to visit Vermont, so maybe... or probably...",0.6859223105435388,4.5,0.9866
Society & Solitude #4,"Poured into a flared tulip, the appearance was a cloudy/hazy burnt orange color with a finger’s worth of white foamy head that dissipates at a nice pace. Moderate lace speckles the glass nicely. The aroma starts off with a beautiful balance between the mango sweetness, somewhat tropical and then flowing into a nice rind-like citrusy bitter grip. Sweet onion starting to come out. The flavor yields to the bitter side first but very quick, and then dries up with the rind, full and pith-like with a super nice juicy to bitter balance rolling into a semi-sticky aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a great balance of sipping to sessionable sort of bittersweet feel to it. Good level of carbonation. Overall, extremely nice DIPA that I would love to have again.",0.7196051291856559,4.5,0.9866
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Opened at 4/20 tasting.  Dark deep ruby red/magenta color, frothy pink head, looks exotic and wonderful. Obviously tons of fruit went into this.  Nose has huge dry brett funk, sour cherries, really an intense fruit character, bright and acidic.  Taste is very tart, big sour cherry character again, not a lot of sweetness from the fruit but lots of fruit character, brettiness and dry funk. Amazing.  Puckering from the sourness, pretty good carbonation for a lambic, pretty drinkable despite the intense sourness.  Fantastic beer, wish it were still readily available off shelf.  9.4/10",0.6809201373804897,4.75,0.9866
Beatification,"Huge thanks to ArchEnemyBrew for sending this beer my way! Thanks Hollis!  Batch 5; bottled on 01/10/2012.  A nice loud pop heard when the cork came out of the bottle. 375ml C&C bottle poured into duvel tulip.  Appearance: Glowing brilliant yellow bodied beer with one finger of white head that drops to a thin cap that stays around for the entire beer.  Smell: Vinegary; tart lemons jump out at your right away. The oak barrel is really noticable too. Earthy, wheat, hay / straw notes and some citrus is in there too.  Taste: This beer is sour! Gotta say its on the high end of sour or it might even break into the low end of high tart sourness. Sour lemons with a touch of vinegar and a touch of funk. Big oak barrel notes as well. Grapefruit and orange rinds citrusy sourness. Lite earthiness, citrus, and moderate sour finish to the beer.   Mouthfeel: Low end of a medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation levels. The mouthfeel on this sour is phenominal. Super dry finish. Very lively carbonation. Huge sour with a perfect mouthfeel.   Overall: My favorite Russian River sour. Its just a seriously delicious sour beer that packs a hardcore sour punch. Its also one of the top American Wild Ales that I have been privilaged to try.",0.6569132492303384,4.5,0.9865
Society & Solitude #4,"A - Hazy golden-orange body, essentially translucent. Big, persistent white head, big lacing.  S - Smacks the nose around with all kinds of hop wildness. Dank, cat, tropical notes, bodies, all mingled together. Some notes attract, some repel, but definitely interesting, and not surprising given the hop bill.  T - But if the nose is all over the place, the taste dials in on the pure hop dream of citrus. Orange juice, grapefruit pith, zest. It is powerful stuff, but the tightrope is walked, and it lands clean. The close is surprisingly mild, crisp, without the stinging bitterness one might expect.  M - This is shockingly clean, crisp, with only mild drying right in the tail end.  O - Rock solid, a double I'd drink any time I could get it, for certain. The only detraction is a wildness in the nose, which fortunately is still largely appealing. The taste and feel are simply amazing. Awe-inspiring work.",0.6842381011204861,4.75,0.9865
Society & Solitude #4,"Poured from a growler filled at the brewery.  Pours a murky golden straw color with a generous white head. Leaves lots of clingy, soapy lacing. Excellent retention.   The aroma is mindblowing. I get loads of citrus up front; orange and grapefruit, a touch of tangerine, followed by some tropical fruit notes. There's a subtle pine needle aroma that sticks out just enough to let you know it's there. The pale malt is sweet and doughy, and subtly present.   The taste follows the nose perfectly. Sweet orange citrus, bittersweet grapefruit, tangerine, some mango and peaches, all balanced out by a bitter pine flavor that is gone as quickly as it hits your palate. Bright and juicy. Just amazing.   The feel, as with most HF IPA's, is soft, creamy, and smoother than Billy Dee Williams. Medium-light carbonation. The finish is not too dry and has just a faint lingering bitterness.   Overall, Hill Farmstead has now brewed my two favorite beers. Double Citra, and this masterpiece. It's pretty much the perfect DIPA, in my humble opinion. It's juicy and fruity, but has enough pine and malt to balance out the sweetness and add depth to an already delicious beer. I have yet to give out a perfect 5, but this is as close as it gets.",0.6995598910334608,5.0,0.9865
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2007 vintage. I had been saving this bottle and opened it in celebration of trying my 2000th beer.  The beer pours a reddish-purple color with a pink head. A great looking beer. The aroma is great. I get a lot of raspberries, but hidden in the background is the Cantillon funk that I love so much. The flavor is even better than the aroma. I get tart raspberries, oak and some of the Cantillon funk. The beer is so dry that it makes your mouth water as soon as you drink it. The salivary glands are working in overdrive. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.   Not only one of the best sours I have ever tried, this is one of the best beers I have had period. It more than lived up to the hype. Well worth the $29 I paid for the bottle and I would buy another bottle again in a heartbeat.",0.6183857673392971,4.5,0.9865
Beatification,"This is a pretty special one for #BOTG 62. Pretty hard to find, thanks to Kevin Harvest for his generosity here. RR corked and caged bottle, popped bottle, and poured slowly into my JK Farmhouse glass. Pours a really cloudy golden color, some white, tight bubbles in the head. It looks like a sour! It actually resembles a Gueuze in a lot of ways. Smell- sour green apples, citrus, earthy funk! I get some eastern asia tropical fruits (like a star fruit)- very tart aroma. Also, some vinegar aroma. So many things in common with a good gueuze. Taste- oh my god, puckering sour. Its the sour you get from biting right into a green apple (unripened) and gnawing on the skin. There is a sugary tartness on my teeth. Also, I get some sour patch kids sourness too. Definite vinegar present on the end, it works well with the sourness, not a detractor at all.

Green matter, citrus rind/oils and a whisper of clean malt. Very easy to drink and generally enjoyable.

Peche 'n Brett,"Thanks to John for the bottle! I love Seizoen Bretta, and I've been looking to try this one for a while.  Popped open the bottle, and found some red-brown residue around the top. No harm. Decanted into a Logsdon's cervoise. Medium amber color, slightly hazy, with a thin but well-retaining off-white head that left a few dots of lacing on the glass. Obvious peach in the nose, but I actually got more fresh saisoniness, wet grass, brett, floral notes. Crisp and clean on the palate, syrupy peach, damp wood, brett, toasted wheat, with a slight sour profile, and a finish of herbal and floral hops. Mouthfeel was crisp and complex, body was medium. Didn't taste or feel anywhere near 10%ABV, though as it warmed, a little essence of neutral alcohol came out in the taste. Great beer overall, and I'd definitely like to get some more.   Word to the wise: despite what the bottle may say, this is not a beer to be aged. Peach fades fast, so drink this fresh! Age the base beer instead.",0.6796613508074321,4.5,0.9864

S- seeet cherries, raspberries, and peaches. A very rich funk that instantly makes your cheeks pucker. There is also a slight smell of cough medicine but not as poignant.   T- follows the nose exactly. The taste is sweet and sour. Sweet cherries and raspberries. Then the sour sits in. Completely taking over the taste buds. The medicinal taste is definitely present on the back end but it isn't bad.   M- sour as hell! Probably the most sour beer I've had. Full bodied as well.  O- a delicious beer.

Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Drie Fonteinen Schaerbeekse Kriek. Bottled April 28, 2010.  Almost perfectly clear. A beautiful raspberry red-pink with a surprisingly soaring off-white head of almost an inch. Left a thick ring and surface foam. Looks marvelous.  Rather tart cherry, light acetic acid, sour peach, oak, red currant, and some light funk. Pretty bright, in a refreshing way, but not as bright as Cantillon Kriek.  Zapping sour cherry and underripe berry tartness with high citric acidity. Musty funk notes are somewhat savory and mushroom-y. Representation of old lemon juice through the style of sourness exemplified. Very oaky, as well, which marries beautifully with the berry and lemon notes.  Excellent tartness on the palate makes a thinner-than-medium body of brew almost slippery. Slippery? Yeah, it slips right down the ol' gullet. Smooth, after all. Carbonation is spot-on; lively and jumpy.  Tasted alonside '10 Cantillon Kriek, '08 Boon Kriek Mariage Parfait, and '07 Drie Fonteinen Oude Kriek. Ranked among the bottom two.",0.6683846788694835,4.5,0.9864
Juicy,"2016 vintage (bottle) at the brewery A: pours a mostly clear copper color with a quickly receding fizzy white head  S: suggestions of pepper and funk, with an understated tartness, there is a sharpness in the nose that suggests cheese though not as much as in other beers of this ilk  T: pulled back a touch, definite funk and tartness but surprising mild, with a clean biscuity malt profile, followed by some hints of lemon and apple, definite hints of pepper as well, this beer sits comfortably somewhere in between a classically defined saison and a farmhouse ale, neither malt heavy nor funk/sour heavy, as it settles out, some of the tartness dies down  M: definitely dry, but with a fullness that lingers on the tongue  O: excellent but not revelatory, definitely lives up to its name in the juicy department, not my favorite kind of farmhouse ale, but great for what it is. Balanced, and immediate in presentation, allowing for the nuances to drift gradually out from under the more prominent and defining notes.",0.7014824561933121,4.25,0.9864

Swish,"This one pours a hazy color that invokes egg yolks mixed with pulpy orange juice- it looks strangely appealing even though it shouldn't.  This smells ridiculous- a pineapple and tangerine explosion, with damp cut grass, marijuana, pine, candied grapefruit, and mango as well- it just leaps out of the glass.  This is basically everything I want a huge NE-style DIPA to be. It's got an absurd juicy and fruity hop character up front- all of the New England fruit basket is there. Tangerine, pineapple, and mango, mostly, with some light sweet grapefruit as well. This has a wonderfully bitter finish as well, like raw hop bitterness and fresh cut grass, I love how it's a juice bomb but not completely dominated by that sort of sweetness, candied and muddled, that you sometimes get from the style.  This has a super soft and pillowy mouthfeel, with a good level of carbonation. It's incredibly drinkable, despite the absolute flavor blast this is.  This is up there with the very best in DIPAs in the world. It's a wonderful accomplishment for Bissell Brothers.",0.6891126190593234,5.0,0.9864

Pours with a fizzy one finger white head that fades pretty quickly.  S- Nose is good and complex. The highlights are slightly tart raspberries and a big acidic sourness. Also noticeable are a hint of vinegar, a slight sweetness, and bready yeast.  T-Flavor is quite tart and offers slightly tart raspberries and a big acidic sourness with a nice bready yeast backbone. A hint of raspberry sweetness comes through for the finish which is a culmination of the initial flavors with an added salty component.  M-Acidic and sour, with low to medium carbonation and medium weight body. Quite good.  D- This is a great lambic. I wish I would have gotten into Cantillon earlier!

Looks amazing, a hazy tangerine with a delightful foamy head. Orange juice on the eyes and the nose. Big ripe mango from top to bottom. The mango and sweet balance of honey really plays well with the tropical and resiny hops. Leaves a satisfying warm aftertaste, with a medium body just adding to the juice factor. Top notch.",0.6980544676985538,4.75,0.9864
Coconut B-Bomb,"this beer is absolutely coco-nuts. Shaved toasted coconuts, like the kind that you get as toppings on pastry and chocolate bars that have that weird hay/chipped wood like consistency that makes you cringe and then immediately break into hives and bloat, escapes en masse from the moment the dark liquid is liberated from its glass cage. Milk chocolate, nougat, and a tiny hint of cold brew coffee is also detectable on the nose as the brew warms up, but the coconut pretty much takes the ball and hogs it throughout the entire aromatic game like Kobe.  Unsurprisingly, coconut is the star of the show on the palate as well, but in true Fremont fashion, it blends almost effortlessly into the already complex and rich palatal fabric that is B-Bomb; chocolate brownie, treated leather, light smoke, hot caramel, and mellow oak keep the coconut neatly in line. The coconut neither becomes more nor less intense with the passage of time as is often the case with coconut stouts and porters; it seems that Fremont is on to something with this Winter Ale business.  Medium-bodied with a gorgeously creamy mouthfeel. No sign of heat despite its humongous 13.0% ABV rating. Gentle, flat diet coke-like carbonation is all that remains from the half-finger head that formed in the onset.",0.6695271325323995,4.5,0.9863
Black Tuesday,"750ml bottle of 2010 vintage.   A: Surprised by the head on this given the amount of booze. Pitch black pour, extremely thick and a small tan head.  S: First thing I noticed was booze. Booze soaked dark fruits. Followed by lots of caramel malts, dark chocolate, bourbon and oak. This thing smells great.  T: Very well balanced bourbon flavor. Not hot at all. Lots of dark fruits and chocolate fudge. Lots of chocolatey goodness, along with some brown sugar, caramel and a tiny bit of vanilla. A bit of maple in the back as well. I was afraid this would be too sweet. It is very sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. Tastes boozy, almost a bit like Utopia or wine. The dark fruits definitely give it a bit of a vinous character.  M: Full bodied with little carbonation. Sticky, thick and sweet. Surprisingly it was very smooth.  O: Absolutely massive sipping beer. Split between two of us and we finished it in a bit over 2 hours. Very nice boozy flavors as it warmed up. Great stuff, I will be on the lookout for more. Can't wait to open the Chocolate Rain and Grey Monday and make some comparisons.",0.6437501119380894,4.5,0.9863
Haze,"Look: pours a nice hazy orange. The kind of look you expect from a Treehouse DIPA with immense juicy aroma.  Smell: Wow! Beautiful tropical fruit coming off the nose gives way to solid hoppy backing. Very juicy, nice orange, mango aroma emerging from the top of this beaut of a beer. Smell is on point with what you expect from this.  Taste: The taste is exotic. Fruity, juicy, very very well balanced. Bitter like a DIPA but oh so juicy! The fruit aroma hits the back of your mouth as you're left with an overwhelming sweet, but incredible taste begging for another sip. This my friends, is the filet mignon of DIPAs.  Feel: feel is wholesome. Very filling, smooth, and pleasant. You can feel the complexity that gets brewed into this beer. From the taste to the feel, this scores 100 all around.   Overall: The juice filled DIPA proves to be a standard of what craft beer aspires to be. Very, very nice. Lucky to only be 45 min away from this gem of a brewery.",0.6686952401574322,4.75,0.9863
Swish,"Traded for this a while ago, even though I have no idea when since there wasn't a date or anything else written on the bottom of the can. I haven't had much from Bissell Brothers but the beers I've been able to sample from then have led me to believe that they can brew a New England IPA as well as anyone and that was certainly the case with this beer.  The pour to this was decent as the liquid was golden, murky and topped off with plenty of head. Not a lot of lacing was left behind as I worked my way through this with much of it remaining as the thin head along the top of my pint glass. The strength of this beer, as well as it's potency, lay in it's taste as the tropical, murky,and turbid nose gave a hint of what was to come once I sipped it. Melon,grass, dank hops, and overt overripe tropical fruit in the nose gave me a hint of what was to come as the dry, chalky nature of the aroma gave me a strong hint of what was to come. Tropical fruit, soft juiciness, and soft hops hit my palate from the get-go and lingered throughout my session, as they formed the backbone of this beer. A light carbonation and moderate alcoholic presence allowed the deep and dank notes of this fully emerge on my palate, as this quietly lingered and fully warmed up to my tongue and ultimately to the rest of my senses...  This had enough alcohol in it but that was nearly irrelevant to everything else that was going on. Sure, lots of sediment was left at the bottom of my pint glass but that paled in comparison to the impression this left on me once the liquid fully went down. While not among the best New England IPA's or best IPA's that I've had as of late, this served as a textbook example of how wonderful this style could be. If you love brews from this neck of the woods or anything fron Bissell, seek this out. It will be well worth your effort!",0.6607580376841985,4.25,0.9863
Chocolate Rain,"A; pours a dark brown colored body with some amber tints to it. created an off-white thin head that quickly dissipated.  S: big alcohol soaked dark fruits right up front, with an awesome sweet dark chocolate toffee/molasses and vanilla bean blats. this beer doesn't smell like its 18.5%..   T: i pick up on an immense sweetness but its not overly sweet. big chocolate, toffee, alcohol soaked figs/raisins, and a bit of heat to it that's actually quite inviting. for 18.5% this is extremely smooth and the finish is an awesome creamy vanilla that helps cut out the alcohol.  M: on the lighter side of full bodied. chocolate, vanilla and touch of alcohol is left on the palate. this is really enjoyable.  O: An outstanding brew. extremely well balanced, and has just the right amount of sweetness to cut out the big ABV.",0.6755362648241325,5.0,0.9863
Nelson,"Pours cloudy orange color with bubbles clinging to the glass in the body of the brew, leading up to a 1-2 finger foamy off white head that was full of bubbles of all sizes , dissipating very slowly and leaving very good spotty foamy lacing. Second pour from bottom half brought out a much better head and left foamy rings as it went down.  Smells of pungent lemon zest, red grapefruit, clementine, yuzu and all things lemony, with a potent citrus hop aroma from the Nelson Sauvin. Some biscuit, toasted grains and crackers show up but get pushed aside by peppery spices, dry floral hops and rye. A whiff of coriander peeks through, and there is a good degree of balance, but this is basically all lemon and grapefruit in the nose with a nice helping of rye.  Tastes like it smells with the lemon, red grapefruit, clementine, yuzu and juicy citrus hops jumping all over your palate at first, then allowing some of the malt base to come through with biscuit, toasted grains and crackers. Some soapy fruit aspects like a rotting pineapple or guava come with the taste, along with faint caramel and graham cracker. The finale is the spices, pepper, dry floral hops, rye, coriander and other spices that are peppery like dry floral hops. The rye must be bringing those peppery spices and taming the bitterness a bit, which is still very high and a little too bitter for me. It's complex yet on the basic side, hiding the ABV beautifully.   Mouthfeel is thin and watery with mild carbonation, a medium body that slides down easy due to it's thin nature, and then zaps you with bitterness before fading semi-dry and leaving lemon and toasted grains as the lasting flavors. Overall a very good beer, but I liked Hoppy Birthday and Pure Hoppiness better than this.",0.6701736293621386,4.25,0.9863
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Appearance is black, staining the glass like soy sauce in a bottle, with an incredibly thin dark brown head, floating around like muddy soap suds.   Smell: ""Maple pecan mocha ice cream"", I immediately think to myself. I don't even eat pecans. Hershey's liquid chocolate, molasses, breakfast at Denny's, but in a good way. A slight charred note. And of course, whisky with a slight alcohol note.   Flavor mostly follows the nose, though with a little less coffee than I would like and the addition of a slightly salty marmite/Vegemite umami note, which I'm learning comes from the whisky barrel. Still, incredible stuff.   Mouthfeel is the thickest I've ever experienced, though certainly not on level with actual molasses or syrup. Perhaps more along the lines of milk, though finding an exact comparison is difficult.   Save for its rather unsubtle profile, the beer is technically perfect, very complex, and easily rivals my other all time fave stout, Tree House's Good Morning, though for somewhat different reasons.",0.6476659988949647,4.75,0.9862
Chocolate Rain,"2013 bottle opened in 2016.  I was expecting something more along the lines of Mocha Wednesday in comparison to Black Tuesday, but the differences are very subtle. The pour is surprisingly thin, but still maintains some of its carbonation. The smell is similar to Black Tuesday: molasses, bourbon, vanilla, and chocolate; with an emphasis on the last two.   With three years on it, I was expecting something less hot, but the booze is still pretty hot up front. The taste is pretty smooth. It is quite sweet and much like the nose, the vanilla and chocolate are more subtle aftertastes. The chocolate does linger on the palette after each sip, which is a fantastic touch.  Overall, I do like it better than Black Tuesday, but I would rather have a Mocha Wednesday.",0.6411157125523176,4.5,0.9862
Society & Solitude #4,Huge thanks to GrumpyOldTroll for the share! Notes from 8/29.  a - brew poured a murky orange yellow with thin fizzy head and spotty lacing. swirling the glass rebuilds the head. looks a bit like honey in a glass.  s - earthy citrus. tropical fruit bouquet.  t - great balanced bitterness with a citric blast. great tropical fruit notes.  m - smooth and even with great carbonation. just a well made beer.  o - Hill Farmstead has come to earn a solid reputation and this is just another beer that backs it up. yet ANOTHER fine DIPA from one of the best breweries out there. these guys just don't make bad beer. they don't even make mediocre beer...very pleased with this beer.,0.6560761016563298,4.5,0.9862
Double Orange Starfish,"Personally, I was disappointed with the regular Orange Starfish, but figured this beer was worth a try based on the accolades. Yup. It's good. Nice sweet fruit on the nose and tongue, and a very creamy mouthfeel. Well balanced as well. Seems more like 6.7% than 8.3%. Little bit of papaya and powdered sugar. Not as good as a few of their beers (Grovestand), but better than most (Dunley Place). I wish this really was their ""standard"" beer and they worked variations from here instead of putting out a lot of hit or miss beers.",0.6402129618762163,4.5,0.9861
Oude Geuze Vintage,"750 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Bottled 12/27/2007. Reviewed from notes.  Appearance - Deep orange with a small head. Clings nicely. Maybe it's just this bottle, but it lacks a bit of the impressive stature of regular Oude Geuze.  Smell - Awesome peppery funk. Heavy hay. Tang citrus that hints towards its sourness. Pepper above all. I love the way 3F gueuzes smell.  Taste - Citrus is more prominent. Orange. Wheat graininess. Pepper in the finish with less funk and a touch of oak.  Mouthfeel - Medium body. A bit heavy for the style and lowish carbonation. Not as effervescent as I'd like.  Overall - I don't know if this is better than regular Oude Geuze. I guess I'd need to try them side by side. Armand blends the best gueuzes and this is no exception. Phenomenal.",0.6780787403937077,4.5,0.9861
Sip Of Sunshine,"Picked up some 4 packs at an awesome homebrew/bottle shop in Woodstock, Vermont last Monday. Beer canned on date of 1/20/17. Pours a slightly hazy yellow with good carbonation. Some suspended particles are evident when held to the light, but really, who cares. Up until now I've been drinking right from the 16-oz can. Smells of juicy tropical fruit...I suspect mostly Mosaic & Citra hops. Notes of strong pineapple & melon & orange. Tastes similar to the nose with a great light bodied, easy drinkability as the alcohol is well hidden for 8% abv. Just a touch of bitterness which lends this beer to being very approachable. Overall, a very well crafted NEIPA. This is what I would consider a classic example. Don't be a hater of the style until you try this one. Very excellent and worth seeking out.",0.6637917298942234,5.0,0.9861
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2005 Vintage, at Monk's in Philly shared with BeerThursday. Served in a Cantillon stemmed goblet.   A: Poured a hazy reddish color with no head or lacing at all. A few small bits of cork ended up in the beer, but no big deal. The cap was very rusty and the cork...did not look good.   S: Very nice raspberry and strawberry aromas. There is a bit of oak and some light funk. For a 7 year old Framboise, it smells fantastic and is incredibly inviting.   T: Surprisingly still rather tart, again a nice combination of raspberry and strawberry flavors with a sizeable amount of oak and barnyard funk coming through, slightly musty.   M: Extremely easy drinking, while the flavors are bold the mouthfeel is very mellow and smooth.   O: Extremely impressed at how well this held up. Saying I want more of this is obvious.",0.6717570080806698,4.5,0.9861
Coolship Red,"Rate #3999!  Pours a beautiful strawberry red, with a small pink head that quickly dissipates. Lots of lively carbonation can be seen.  The aroma burst forth with raspberries, but there's a lot more going on here! Pie crust, must, cobwebs in an old basement, and bright, citric acidity. Freshly cut hay is there, but then gets overtaken by cherry and raspberry pie! I could get lost just smelling this beer! Delightful!  Acid and funk play off each other, while the raspberry plays a secondary role. The resident microflora are the stars of the show here, and they put on quite a performance. It's quite puckering, but also dry, which brings you back for more. Raspberry and crusty malt round this out well.  Fairly bracing acidity, with a fairly full body for the style and abv. A good amount of carbonation, and a dry finish.  This really is a treat, and proof that not all American Wild Ales aren't just sour bombs, they can have deep complexity, reminiscent of Iambic. That said, if they could slightly dial back the acidity they would really have a beer that rivals the best sours in the world!",0.6983168768153892,4.5,0.986
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"375 mL bottle into tulip glass. Big, dark, boozy, bourbon, hot. There's a rating that could be given for this as a BA beer or as a maple beer. As a BA beer, I'd definitely give a higher rating and probably recommend putting it in a cellar for a bit. But so much of the hype around this was the maple. I lean on grading this as a maple beer. This is largely wanted for the maple. It's there but very hidden, popping up only briefly along with other wonderful, great notes for a fantastic overall profile, but the finish especially was hot. Still a fantastic beer. Would love to try again in a year.",0.5876874291287693,4.25,0.986
Peche 'n Brett,"something about me and certain fruited wild ales that i just cant get over. this is one of the best ive ever had, a truly unique brew, maybe the best example of peaches in a beer ive ever seen. its hazy and pale, heady as they come, faint glowing orange. im smelling the fizzy ripe yellow peach, sweet and like nothing else nature produces. the brett is intense, mature, getting tart rather than just funky. there is also this creamy vanilla aroma that is supported by a heavy wheat malt base and patience. the flavor is an oh my god moment, or series of moments each sip. im floored by this, its so unique. the peaches and the brett are elevated well beyond where they have gone in other beers, to the point of being explosive on the palate. i like the bottle more and more as it drinks down too, the dregs being almost my favorite part because of how alive it all seems to be. the peaches and brett are the perfect combination, its just incredible. my mouth waters for more as i write this. effervescent carbonation and a puckery dry finish thats about as expressive as brett can be. nothing subtle about it, but expertly refined. i absolutely must get my hands on more of this magic!  edit: batches since my first taste have been markedly less impressive. more weirdness to the yeast, less true fruit, i dont know if this has changed or not, of if there is an ageing curve, but i liked this the most when i had it first, and will leave high scores in tact to reflect that, but i have yet to enjoy it nearly as much as the first time...",0.6911802806526075,4.25,0.986
Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"750ml bottle poured into a stemmed chalice. Reviewed from notes.  The beer pours a cloudy straw color, hues of oranges and yellows, that sports a very lively, white head, that has great retention and yields a nice amount of lace. The aroma is very citrus forward, lemon and light lime, subtle funk, light mustiness, plenty of oak and wine barrel presence that also showcases some delightful floral qualities. The flavors are in line with the nose, nice tart citrus, plenty of yeasty funk, much more of the base saison comes through, nice floral flavors that don't read as medicinal, light wine grape, oak barrel with a slightly grainy finish. The mouthfeel is very lively, but still feels full bodied, zippy, coats the mouth fairly well with a nice finish that has a bit of a prickle but still refreshing.  Verdict: A very, very enjoyable saison from Sante Adairius and Triple Rock. The barrel aging adds a wonderful tart quality that comes close to straddling the line of an American Wild, without compromising the integrity of the base beer. The citrus could easily be seen as too dominant, but I enjoyed that tartness and what other flavors it drew out of the beer. A top notch farmhouse/saison style beer, must try.",0.7093377646309137,4.5,0.986
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"On tap at City Beer Store in SF. 2006 version.  A: A beautiful pinkish/red color. Hard to believe this is beer but pretty cool looking. Not much of head.  S: Tart and sour raspberries dominate. Some lambic-like muskiness but farily reserved. Smells great.   T/M: Same as the smell. Mouth-puckeringly sour raspberries. Some funkinees. Finish is nice and dry with good carbonation.  D: A very refreshingly tart beer  I'm generally not huge of lambic fruit beers (but love the non-fruit variety). I enjoyed this one a lot, though.",0.6503263967521602,4.0,0.986
Juicy,"Bottle generously provided by Tom and shared by Kyle. Thank you both so very much!  Pours a clouded orange with a thin white skim. Looks very enticing when backlit.  Smells is predominantly saison-y....green pear, loads of pepper, funky, and yeast with only a faint hint of tart. It's nice but subtle, if not a tad muted.   Tastes much different than it smells. The front end is a wonderful tangerine-grapefruit blast that coats the tongue and lingers on the lips for a good long while. When the beer hits the back of the tongue it transitions into a very dry and sandpaper finish with a light sulfur fade.   Such an interesting beer with a very noticeable transition from front to back. The juiciness sticks to your lips and front of the tongue while the dry finish just hangs on the back of the palate. Like no beer I've ever tasted.   Another beer I feel very fortunate to have tried and am appreciative of the opportunity.",0.6637202498168577,4.75,0.986
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"11.2oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours a cloudy glowing burnt yellow with a fluffy creamy eggshell white head that sticks around leaving great thick retention and very sticky lacing. The aromas have lots of banana and cloves. Hints of bubblegum. The yeast does its thing. The flavors follow the nose perfectly. The flavors are extremely clean. More banana and cloves with some other subtle spice notes in the mix. More bubblegum. Subtle hints of citrus. The yeast blends well with everything. Solid malt backbone. Alcohol goes completely unnoticed. Mouthfeel is great. It's light with moderate carbonation. Very creamy and fluffy. Too smooth and easy to drink.   This beer is a classic. It's extremely refreshing and perfect for the warm weather, or anytime for that matter. The craftsmanship is very impressive. Highly recommended.",0.7201488357608891,4.5,0.986
Enjoy By IPA,"Enjoy By 12.25.15. Bottled on 11/18/15. 9.4%ABV.  Bomber ($8.99) poured into a stem.  Look: Pour golden, clean, clear, champagne color. Half to 3/4' white head, that quickly subsides to 1/8"" to 1/4"" layer that hangs around for a while. A volcano of champagne size bubbles rising from the bottom of the stem. When swirled in the glass a bit, to wake up more of the buquet, it leaves really nice heavy lacing on the glass.  Nose: Upon initial pour the buquet is BIG citrus (grapefruit, orange peel) that quickly subsides and becomes very subtle. Swirl it a bit and those champagne bubbles wake up! Some floral notes, perhaps Magnolia, rich yet crisp and clean. Really opens up as it warms!  Taste: Bitter grapefruit, orange peel, perhaps a hint of green mango, vanilla. Very, very clean and crisp. The bitterness, for me, is by no means excessive or overpowering. Alcohol content very well hidden. Flavors become richer as it warms.  Feel: Very light on the tungue initially. The bitterness is very much in the fore and subsides to a slight sweetness. Very, very, clean, crisp.  Overall: Without out doubt a keeper! I hope I have another bottle amongst my stash. It'd be worth a side-by-side tasting with Arrogant Bastard, Double Arrogant Bastard, Tunderstruck and, the standard Stone IPA, to sus out the differing nuances of each. That's a lot of brew! Calls for a tasting, with lots of help! :)  CHEERS!!!",0.6783130219326657,4.25,0.986
Second Fiddle,"Canned on 3/6/19  Pours a clear, faintly copperish kind of gold with an ample, slightly rocky white head; very nice retention that results in plenty of persistent lacing and a frothy, albeit bubbly collar.  Aromas of dank peach, grapefruit, and tropical pith comes through strongly, with lighter notes of orange zest, pine, and bits of hoppy spice following; a restrained dankness comes through in spots, while a clear crisp malt backbone that dives into deeper notes of fresh rising dough and black bread crusts starts to shine on the finish.  Taste profile is predominantly dank herbs and fruity rind, along with subtle hints of white grape must in the background; great bit of restrained hoppy, pithy bitterness along with some crackery malt on the finish; bitter, juicy, and hints of sweetness, this is a soft but incredibly varied IPA profile.  Mouthfeel brings a medium-light body with perfectly balanced carbonation; crisp throughout with an underlying fluff to give it the most easygoing kind of weight across the palate; this just pops on the tongue, and peaks across the palate almost perfectly.  A true hybrid of West Coast and New England style IPAs; with so many IPAs out there now, this one may have lost some of its previous luster, but damnit if it isn't still one of the more universally palate-pleasing examples of an IPA out there. Soft but balanced, and showing great variety in its profile and consistency throughout, this is still quietly a great IPA that shouldn't be overlooked.",0.7513475775906635,4.0,0.986
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Bottle has 2008 sticker date, poured in July 2011 for my Cantillon birthday tasting.  This is a BEAUTIFUL beer, pure raspberry pink with an equally pink head. What a crazy looking head! Gorgeous beer.  Smells wonderful, tons of raspberry and tons of acidic sour.  Tastes even better, there is a CRAZY amount of raspberry flavor in this beer. This is the fruitiest lambic I've ever tasted. Also an extremely sour beer, this is heartburn in a bottle right here. The extreme fruitiness and extreme sourness combine into a remarkable lambic.  Very nice carbonation, good body to support the fruit and sour kick in the flavor.  Generally I prefer kriek to framboise but this one blew me away, much better than the Lou Pepe Kriek, just as good or better than the Blabaer we had the same night. I love this beer and want more!  9.9/10",0.6281306770624357,4.75,0.986
Haze,"poured into snifter. wonderful look of cloudy pineapple juice. nose is fresh mango, pineapple maybe slight orange. mouthfeel is excellent just like all treehouse where your entire mouth is coated by hop particles. flavor profile seems to be fresh pineapple and citrus followed by some juicy grapefruit and rounding out with some nice sweetness. this beer is overall outstanding like all treehouse. im not sure if this is better or worse than julius, alter , green. etc. they are all really outstanding. it just depends on what hops your palate likes best. edit: did side by side with very hazy and very similar. very had little more nose and more bitterness. slightly more flavor throughout. little darker in color.",0.6922475805791449,4.5,0.9859
Black Tuesday,"2012 vintage split with my two brothers and dad, poured into snifters. Appearance was jet-black with no head to speak of. Lots of alcohol legs.  Smell was pretty inviting. Lots of booze, but balanced out by tons and tons of dark fruits and chocolate.  Taste, alas was just a bit too intensely overwhelming for me. It's obvious from the smell that you are about to catch a beatdown, but the bourbon is just ferocious. Don't get me wrong, I like bourbon well enough, but this is far and away the most aggressively barrel-forward beer I have ever tried. I split this bottle four ways, and the one guy who really liked bourbon thought it was awesome, the rest of us agreed that this is one that should probably be laid down for a long time. The heat was also very formidable, as you would expect from such a huge beer. There is plenty going on here, but my brain was just screaming ""BOURBON"" and ""HEAT"".  The mouthfeel was full-bodied, sweet and sticky, appropriate for the style.  Overall, this one was ok, but just a little over the top for me. Perhaps being consumed at the end of a long, intense stout season had a lot to do with it..I will let the other bottle I have sit until the fall and revisit hopefully a little more mellowed out version, and with a renewed desire for big, barrel-aged stouts after a summer of sours and IPA's.",0.6070567800942339,3.75,0.9859
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"From the shorty bottle from the brewery in a snifter. This beastly little brew pours a rich  opaque with a nice head of dark brown foam that settles to a thick ring , a thin pool, and shows some nice light lacing. Nose of boozy bourbon, subtle vanilla, mild oak, light  char touched marshmallow, sweet dark maple, and rich malts. Flavors nail it out of the park with rich toasted nutty malts dancing about maple and deep brown sugars that have become  drunken on boozy bourbon. Mild vanilla and more assertive oak give richness without being overly  cloying to a lightly char touched marshmallow and dark rich cocoa that has a subtle coffee note on  the back that has of course gotten drunk on bourbon as well. Fantastic mouth feel; full lightly slick  body, low carbonation, and a rich boozy finish laced with more flavor than there is characters on a  keyboard. Exceptional.   Cheers",0.6823759092306749,4.5,0.9859
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Poured from a 500ml bottle into tulip glass:  Appearance: as stoutly as they come, it pours motor-oil thick, with a thin mocha-colored head and a super dark body. Black as night. Little to no carbonation evident, the head dissipates after a minute or so, leaving slightly sticky lacing.  Aroma: really surprised by how much habanero was in the scent here. I honestly hadn't really done any research prior to trading for this one, but the habanero bangs here. Slight chocolate, lots of heat, both spicy and boozy. Love it.  Taste: wow, super spicy! Reminds of Huna, but in my opinion, more complex and deep. First sip is all sweet and decadence, with the finish being slightly spicy. As it warms, the peppers really come out and release some serious heat. Finishes cinnamon-vanilla after the spice though......this is a home run of a stout. So many flavors, but nothing overtakes anything else and it nails the style.  Feel: thick, full-bodied, and a total sipper.  Overall: this is one of the best beers I've had in a while. seek and destroy!",0.6646957231792021,4.75,0.9859
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Bottle from Joe. Pours pitch black with a very small brown head on top, looking dense and creamy. Aroma is plenty of spicy earthy coffee and a nice vanilla bourbon sweetness in the background. Bourbon and coffee are strong here. Flavor is lots of rich chocolate and bourbon, plenty of earthy delicious coffee, more oaky bourbon, light roast, lots of sweetness. Really smooth beer with a body that's a bit lighter than I'd usually expect from an imperial stout, but this is what seems to happen with JO's and it doesn't take much away. Still a big and rich beer with a strong bourbon influence. Good stuff.  Tried this again. Body seems beefed up a bit. Awesome!",0.6776447432200091,4.5,0.9859
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"-Bottle April 28th, 2010  Poured into a champagne flute. Crimson red, rose petal in color. Has a small pink head of foam thats very rich and vivid. Reminds me of strawberry taffy or tropical starburst, the strawberry/banana kind.  Fresh cherries on the nose. Kinda doughy, pie crust. Aromas of baked cherry pie, or warm cherry strudel. Nutty, unroasted almonds, cherry pits and wet stone on the nose. Some barnyard funk, a little musty, hay barn. The funk is rather mellow though. Sour nose, vinegar and tart strawberries. Fresh blossomed flowers, flower nectar or pollen. As the beer warms I pick up a vanilla, beeswax aroma.  Descent, medium to low carbonation at first, but goes relatively flat halfway through the glass. Very dry and acidic in the mouth, balsamic vinegar. Lots of tartness. Makes me think of biting into a very red, super ripe strawberry, eating a green apple jolly rancher or rhubarb straight from the garden. Fresh cherries, baked cherry pie, almonds, the pit of a cherry are all in there. Flavors I'd expect in a kriek along with blood oranges, pink grapefruit and lots of ripe strawberries.  Mellow, musty barnyard funk aromas. A little band-aid, medicinal character. The sour/tartness is a more predominate flavor though. Fresh cherries linger on the palate in the finish, with a puckering strawberry tartness. I'm surprised by how much the flavors of strawberries are pronounced in this beer.  A very clean beer in aroma and taste.",0.6298454930715502,4.0,0.9859
Peche 'n Brett,"1762nd Review on BA Bottle to Blue Palms taster 750 ML  Batch 2  Shared with GuruDel and MrHyschybar  App- When this came out of the bottle. It was a very dark orange with a bit of a haze to it. The bubbles were a bit small and didnt leave any cling like a normal saison would. The barrel took some of the carbonation away and left more a dark color.  Smell- I was expecting an explosion of deep barnyard ""funk"" with the oak balancing things out and then the peche coming in to tie it all together. The peche was a bit small on this one and the ABV made for a unique balancing act of aromas on this one. A bit of a crushed damp wheat smell was in there as well.  Taste- Well I have to say I was a bit let down. Maybe I thought it would be more like V010 (Which I havent had) I was expecting maybe this giant peche explosion with a Rayon vert like flavor to just blow me away. I got more of the wood barrel and small funk with only a small bit of peche behind it. Well layered but lacking in ""pop"" for me.  Mouth- This had a good feel behind it. A bit medium in body with a good amount of thick carbonation with a solid funk residual flavors behind it. The peche didnt stick around for very long and the barrel seemed to dominate again with that crushed wheat flavor.  Drink- It was a good beer, but again didnt blow me away. I think letting a bottle sit, might help. I truly feel this wouldve been better as say a wild ale with more of a light flavor and more peche behind it. I am glad this was at a share and not a traded bottle.",0.6295534740954787,3.5,0.9859
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"My sweet little cup of joy. I saw one of the barrels (a Woodford Reserve barrel! YAY!) at FFF in October, and was nearly in tears, knowing I'd never get to try it. I live in Alabama, and can't just hop on up to the brewpub when something special is on tap....so I was overjoyed to hear it was in the lineup for DLD. Oh JOY!  I forked over my cash, and got my lil' plastic cup. dangit! Spilled a bit on my hand. Never before has my own hand been so lickable. Syrupy, sticky when it dried....oh, a beer-pop would be heaven now.  But seriously....thick black, some slight cola fringe around it, and a deep bronze head that seemes a bit thin, but is adequate...sort of like my brain cells.  On the nose, the bourbon hits right up frount- a nice round, not too sharp bourbon at that. Sweet, dark maltiness follows.  The flavour is paradisal to my humble tongue. Once more, the bourbon up front. Nice and thick and sweet, it almost instantly shuts off and is replaced by coffee and bittersweet chocolate. The bourbon hits again at the end, along with a mellow bitterness.  On the mouth, it's velvety and a little oily all at once- nice and thick, with very little apparent carbonation. Just the way I like it.. ;)  Drinakble? Understatement. If I could have this one on tap all the time, I'd be dead now.  Be well -UF",0.6022532699637335,5.0,0.9859
Enjoy By IPA,"4.20.16 version.  Look (4): A golden yellow and orange tangy looking brew. Exactly what I'd say the sun set looks like. Kind of hazy. A big white heady that is cloudy like in color and froth.  Smell (4): It's like opening a door in your refrigerator that's been holding fresh tangerines and peaches. It's got a lovely citrus and tropical aroma as well as some bacog round caramel malt aroma. Also a very dank weed smell is evident through the whole smelling process.  Taste (4.25): Tropical cut up peaches and pineapples are being thrown at my face. It's clearly got more then one specific hop used in it and the dankness clearly takes hold and doesn't let go. A malty backbone definitely helps a bit with balancing this out, but it's definitely a hop heads dream brew.  Mouthfeel (3.75): It's like licking a fruit with fuzz and then while pulling your tongue away you end up with some cream texture on it. It's definitely lighter bodied then I remember the last version... the aftertaste is never ending #thisiswhybeerisbetterthenwine  Overall (4): A solid 4. Nothing will ever be as good as when you have it the first time around, but I definitely remember the last version being a bit more full bodied and malty.",0.6711297889810202,4.0,0.9859
Very GGGreennn,"A- Tallboy pours into a snifter with a chalky and floury yellow orange body. A thick and truly creamy white cap rises out of the beer to an inch high with amazing retention. Tons of lacing in thick blankets around the glass.  S- Can smell fresh hops all the way across the room moments after pouring this one with tons of fruit, dank herbs and floral notes as well. The hop bouquet has strong melon, mango, papaya, dank weed and peach with hints of tangerine, citrus zest, floral hops, pungent mint, creamsicle and slight onion. This one is basically all hops with some sweet suggestion.  T- Definitely one of the better Tree House brews I have had in the last few months. This one rides the balance between sweet, juicy hops and bitterness wonderfully with everything starting out with those juicy melons, papayas, bubble gum and peach. Beyond that are hints of tangerine, creamsicle, berries, zesty orange, grapefruit, mint and dank weed. Just another level of juicy on this one. Fairly sweet but it suits the nectar hops.  MF- The appearance foreshadowed this one. The body is about as soft and creamy as it gets for any beer. Fluffy and pillowy on the palate with a moderately high level of carbonation. Finishes with a light-medium bitterness.  This is some top notch Tree House hop utilization. Reminds me of the best batches of the original Green with just how soft, tropical and juicy this beer is with a perfect balance of sweetness and a widely varied hop bouquet.",0.6814281053349069,4.75,0.9859
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"2016 vintage drank in the #proper KBBS 2016 glassware on 2/12/2017. Bottle #438  Look - thick and oily, deep and dark brown, with minimal head. About as little head as possible while still having some. The lacing on this was incredible. It just stuck all over the glass, which in the end, left a nice little sip after it all settled back down.  Smell - the maple is massive! I am absolutely shocked at how strong the maple comes through after barrel aging. It's sweet and lovely but the maple itself is quite unique of a maple flavor. It's bold and awesome. The barrel and coffee open up with warming but nothing overpowering. The coffee was almost hidden till it really warmed. The bourbon barrel and fudgey chocolate are way ahead of coffee but way behind the maple.  Taste - definitely follows the nose. The coffee comes through a little more on the tongue than the nose. It's almost espresso-like as opposed to coffee. It is very straight forward, nothing too unique, but nothing short of exquisite.  Feel - thick AF. Nothing compares to it except maybe Assassin 2014. So much thicker than the next beer in line with thickness that I've had. Unreal. No booze at all. Could chug this if I didn't want to take as long as possible to drink and enjoy.  Overall - certainly lives up to the hype. Worth the long drive and chase for this vintage. Would love to try previous year's but doubtful I ever will.",0.622262600977475,5.0,0.9859
Dragonsaddle,"For me, I have experienced all of the hoof hearted beers I have wanted to sample. This.... this is the best by far. It is absolutely delicious with every sip you take. It has only gotten better with age. I can't really describe it too much. The aroma is pineapple, mango, peach, orange. The taste is straight juice with some hop bitterness. And the alcohol is covered so well that I can't even seem to distinguish where it begins and ends. It is one of the best examples of what this brewery can do and one of the best beers I have had all year. I truly love this beer and the 16.99 I paid for the four pack (x3 because I bought 3 total 4 packs) is well worth it. I think they have finally found there stride at hoof. I had roller blabe and didn't enjoy it till I waited 5 weeks post batch. South of Eleven was excellent. I really liked Konkey Dong. And this beer... this beer is truly why I drink the style. I just absolutely love it! I hope they can brew it more then once a year, but if that is the case... I will be back next year! Great job Hoof. You have finally made me want to consistently go to every release!",0.5772626553944481,4.75,0.9859
Oude Geuze Vintage,"2002-2007 Vertical, split amongst good friends at our engagement part. Bottles provided by Alex, Jason, and myself. 375ml and 750ml bottles for the various years.  I would rank them in the following order: 2003, 2002, 2005 (Feb), 2007, 2005 (Dec), 2004, and 2006 (bad bottle, I think).  *I am going to rate into one but not going to include the 2006, because it was so damn bad, and would really hurt the overall score.  A - All pour a very similar mirky/hazy golden yellow, fizzy white head, some spotty lacing, bubbles here and there on top. Some had more carbonation then others, but overall, all very similar (and no gushers).  S - Funk, sour/tart notes, lactic notes, lemon peels, barnyard. Most of the vintages were restrained in lip-puckering funk/sour/tart, don't get me wrong, it was there, but not as evident as other 3F sours. I enjoyed this characteristic, truthfully.  T - More sour/tart notes then funk, but a good balance of everything. Nice barnyard, sour funky acidic notes, lemon peel citrus, orange peel, slight touch of oak. Some years were more funky then others, but this is what I tasted overall.  M - Light, crisp, fizzy champagne-esk carbonation, dry finish.  D - It was wonderful to drink 2002-2007 at one time and really makes you appreciate all the various years and maturity/aging. The winner for me was 2003 but it would be near impossible to pick any year (besides 2006) blind.   Thanks to Jason and Alex for helping make this happen. I really appreciate it and it was a fun part of the celebration (although those non-BA's thought we were crazy...haha).",0.6106927809837249,4.5,0.9858
Green,Got on trade for a Pliny the Elder... fair trade on first taste.   Pours a cloudy bright opaque light gold color. Head is thin but its a shared pour so not sure if its normal.  Aroma is sharp with nectarine and grapefruit notes. Loving this combo. Slightly sweet and tangy.  The flavor up front is a blast of green grapefruit and stonefruit. Fantastic clean hop taste. Bitterness kicks in midway through but never bullies in. Finishes with a tangy citrus. Damn this is a great flavor profile!  Feel is very soft and acerbic. Very nice.  So impressed with this one. I know this is one of the premier tree house beers but god this lives up to it. Can't say enough good things.,0.68621764796799,5.0,0.9858
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"I got this beer at my local super market the label caught my eye. ""Weihenstephaner Worlds Oldest Brewery"" had a nice ring to it. I poured the beer into a 24oz glass. Pours with a big head that takes some time to dissipate. In my glass, the beer has a dark yellow top. The bottom of the glass seems to be a lighter yellow. It is a nice, ""eye catchy"" flow. The beer smells very fruity. I can smell very sweet fruit like Bananas and apples, as well as floral hops. It's an overall very pleasant smell. The taste is very different. I have never tasted a beer that tastes quite like this. It tastes very fruity and a little dry. I can defiantly taste the dryness of bread and corn. The beer is also very sweet with a slight barley noticeably banana taste. It also has a nice slight hint of lemon. The taste really blends together as you swallow it. Reminds me of a beer that would be marketed as a ""sumer Ale."" It kind of reminded me of a better version of AtWaters, ""Dirty Blonde."" Overall, it is something that is very different. I would buy it again, I liked it.",0.6395127337941572,4.25,0.9858
Nelson,"delicious, but im not sure if im drinking the nelson of alpine lore, or the green flash version. either way, its pretty good. hazy orange in color. huge citrus nose. great flavor, nice backbone. mouthfeel really stands out for me. medium bodied with great carb. very nice.",0.6949360269382472,4.25,0.9858
Juicy,"Reviewing the infamous Juicy from Hill Farmstead Brewery out of Greensboro Bend, Vermont. This dry hopped saison is aged in the barrels that were used to age Mimosa.  Score: 95  November 2012 vintage bottle served in a Darkness chalice and enjoyed on 03/19/14. Review is from iPhone notes.  Appearance: Pours a nice murky orange color with a finger of off-white head that settles to a thick ring around the glass and splotchy, wispy coating. Amazing lacing and retention; crazy cling. 4.75/5  Smell: Apricot, grapefruit, grapes, a touch of barnyard funk and sweet malt. Really nice tropical juiciness, wine character and young-ish saison aroma mix. Warms up to a little bit of lacto and PDO comes out of the woodwork into the mix. 4.5/5  Taste: Bready malt and white wine, following by grapefruit/stone fruit and a little tannic acidity. Straw-like flavor and tropical juiciness in the finish, lingering with just a kiss of funk. Really nice flavors here, blending gracefully. 4.5/5  Mouthfeel: Light-plus bodied, good carbonation. Juicy mouthfeel with a dry finish. Nice earthiness with a good light tartness. 4.5/5  Overall: Many have said this beer aged is a shell of its former fresh self, but I found it to be delicious aged nearly a year and a half regardless of how much better it may or may not have been fresh. Relative to Dry Hopped L'Brett D'Or, as aged, my palate prefers Juicy. With ample tropical juiciness, a nice wine character and a dry finish, this beer offers lots of complexity. Drink 'em now fellas.  Cost: $8 for a 375 ml bottle.",0.6884198337113132,4.5,0.9858
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Drank from a 12 fl oz (355 ml) bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA PKG 10/16/2018 Served in a snifter  Review #1700  Shimmery, near pitch black appearance. Oily and slick on the pour and also in the glass. The liquid was topped by thin swirls of khaki colored froth. A few droplets of lacing stuck along the glass.  Bourbon notes came through big time in the aroma. Super rich and smooth with a nice amount of sweetness. Fresh vanilla notes were also quite apparent. The beer almost smelled like it was infused with vanilla beans. Dark fruits also came through strong. Plums and raisins specifically. There was a punchy dark chocolate presence too.  The flavor was similar to the aroma but more roasty and bitter. Loads of robust maltiness on the front end. Some caramel malt notes came through as well. Moderately sweet. Chocolate fudge was noticeable. Dark fruits appeared in the center. Big raisin and plum character. More roasted malt character on the back end. The beer finished with acrid, char-like notes and some lingering ashy bitterness.  Nice plush mouthfeel. Medium-full bodied for the style. Creamy and smooth on the palate. The liquid contained a fine, somewhat subtle effervescence. For a 13.4% ABV beer, the alcohol was hardly detectable.  While kitchen sink pastry stouts seem to be getting all the attention these days, it is nice to find a simple barrel-aged imperial stout that draws its complexity from more traditional means. Bell’s Bourbon Barrel-Aged Expedition Stout might not carry the cache it did when it was first released, but it still stands the test of time. While I really enjoyed my relatively fresh bottle, I can imagine it drinking even better with some age.",0.6979776699246021,4.25,0.9858
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Finally got to try this one. On-tap at DLD '10.  A- Poured a dark, chocolate brown color. Looked very thick, like motor oil. Produced minimal amount of head. Dissipated instantly.   S- Sweet malts with molasses. The sweetness in the aroma was very potent. The background had a slight hint of vanilla, bourbon and tons of oak.  T- Much like the aroma, actually exactly like the aroma. Sweetness upfront from various malts and molasses. Some bourbon and vanilla in there as well. The finish was dominated by an overwhelming amount of oak. Really wanted to give this a 4.25, but couldn't...so I rounded up.   M- I loved the mouthfeel of this beer. Thick, chewy and viscous. Coated the palate very well.   D- I'm glad they served this in a small 6 oz. glass (could of been 8 oz.). If I had any more it would have been very difficult to put down.  Overall, a very good beer. That being said, at $9 a pour, I will pass from now on...much better bourbon, oak-aged beers out there at a better value.",0.6672229352004544,4.0,0.9858
Sip Of Sunshine,"Finally was able to try this one fresh. Overall, very good in every way. I'm not sure if this beer has come down in quality over time, as I couldn't really understand the 4.5+ score here, but it was a very good beer. Well rounded with a full nose and a mix of citrus and tropical in the flavor. However, as local fresh IPA quality has improved, I couldn't say this was better than many other very good beers. Price was also very high for what it is. Would love to try on tap at the brewery to see if there is more to it.",0.6414814626168499,4.0,0.9857
Mastermind,"Poured from a 12 oz can into a Nonic glass. Canned 9/9/16.  A: Pours a super hazy, yellowish-gold color with a very small, foamy, white head with minimal retention. Thin, white, bubbly lacing throughout.  S: Super fruity with huge aromas of pineapple, apricot, mango, passionfruit, and orange. Very mild notes of piney and earthy hops.  T: Juice bomb right here. Taste matches aromas well. Tropical fruit and citrus purée consisting of pineapple, mango, orange, grapefruit, peach, and passionfruit. Ends with piney, earthy, and resinous hops with a mild lingering bitterness.  F: Medium bodied, super juicy, smooth, and somewhat crisp with good carbonation.  O: Overall, a great DIPA. Awesome juiciness to this one, but well balanced with hop bitterness at the end of each sip. Very drinkable and the ABV is hidden well. Would love to try this fresh and would definitely go after this in the future. Really glad I received this as an extra in a trade. Surprised this isn't rated higher on the top DIPA list.",0.6935166496638354,4.75,0.9857
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"6 oz tap pour into a clear plastic cup at Dark Lord Day 2010.  A - The syrupy pour is totally black with a tiny ring of dark tan foam. Like VBDL, it's not much to look at. It's got even less foam on this pour.  S - The aroma is very heavy of roasted malts and strong oak wood. A small chocolate and alcohol hint comes out with a warming finish. Bold presence and deep nose.  T - It starts with a big oak flavor with tons of chocolate and roasted malt flavors going on. The alcohol is smooth and kept under control by a well-balanced barrel finish.  M - Oak-Aged DL is just as thick and viscous as VBDL with a rich, full body and smooth, throat-coating finish. The alcohol adds a soft warming sensation to the finish too.  D - For how rich and full-bodied this bold RIS is, it's a winner that deserves it's recognition. I think the balance of oak flavor without the pesky and cliché alcohol burn in this RIS is very well done. Nicely drinkable for it's potency too.",0.6666508582757111,4.5,0.9857
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2007 vintage and the most expensive beer I have purchased to date at just shy of 30.00. Beautiful pour - A clear bright dark cherry color with a faint short lasting pink head. Aroma is all fresh, tart raspberries, not too sweet and vaguely woodsy. Nice. As for the rest... This may be the most sour beer I have ever tried to get down. If not, it was definitely in the running. Neither brett nor raspberry is noticeable. There is only a mouth-watering acidity, so aggressively harsh that my stomach began to recoil in horror at about the halfway point. I sat the remaining half bottle aside, to give my insides a chance to recuperate. I fully intended to have at least one more glass, but like most good intentions, I just never got around to it.  Please, for the love of god, share this beer with friends. This is a beer that should be enjoyed by the glass. Don't attempt to ""man up"" and consume this bottle by yourself. The results could be...troubling.",0.6248294898906498,3.0,0.9857
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Bottled on 4-28-2010.  Pours magnificently red with a small light pink head that fades quickly. Very little lacing. The beer looks almost artificially red. Very neat.  Tart cherries, oak, earthy funk in the aroma. Slightly cheesy funk. Sour with a touch of sweetness coming through. Thoroughly complex.  Sour, really sour. Having had many sour wild ales lately, I wasn't expecting this to hit me over the head, but it sure does. Tons of tart cherries combine with sour and funk. Still a hint of sweetness in the middle of it. Oak and more funk are apparent after getting accustomed to the sourness. Super dry but the sourness lingers for a while.  Relatively low carbonation, but that doesn't keep it from feeling lively. Decent body, fills the mouth quite well.   Awesome sour beer. So many other sour/wild ales really just can't compare to the folks at Drie Fonteinen.",0.6776540110666346,4.5,0.9857
Enjoy By IPA,"'Enjoy by 4/20/2016' sampled on 4/5/2016, poured from a bomber into a tulip.  L: Pours a clear medium golden color. Thick creamy off-white head that falls quickly. Great sticky lacing.  S: Dank tropical fruits and hibiscus... mango and citrus.  T/F: Rich malt backbone giving way to an awesome hop profile... citrus and tropical fruit notes dominate... grapefruit and lemongrass... warming with the high ABV. Medium body.... clean finish.  O: Another (after many other) amazing IPA's from Stone. Love the concept and how they put their money where there mouth is in regards to freshness. A great beer and one I'll have again (hopefully many many times).",0.6759473211782404,4.5,0.9857
Sip Of Sunshine,"Oh, man, the hype around this beer, where I live, is huge. You can't get it in the local packy...unless, you spend lots of money at a craft beer oriented store, know the owner, and get on the ""list."" For the most part, it's unattainable, as the stores get a weekly(ish) delivery of about 1-2 cases, which never even get displayed.  What's funny about it is that Lawson's is in Vermont, but it's brewed at Two Roads in Connecticut. I live closer to Two Roads (~1 hr away), but can not get this at any store. I had to go to Stowe, VT, to pick up a few 4-pks...and, definitely worth the trip. I'm surprised; it's a little less hazy than I expected. And, the lacing seems to slip down the glass...but, the jury is still out (for me) as to the significance of lacing. Regardless, this is a fantastic hop-forward beer that I wish were easier to get. The carbonation is right. The alcohol is right. It's smooth and very easy to drink. Heck, I even like the name, and the look of the can. Hey, if you want this beer, and you live with a 2-hr drive from Stowe, VT, I say it's worth the trip...go to the Stowe State Liquor store, conveniently located around the corner from The Alchemist Brewery, and get yourself some...guaranteed. And, you can get a bunch of other goodies, too. Just remember...bring an empty cooler...a big one.  If you live too far away and can't get your hands on this.....I'm so sorry.",0.5095307786945416,4.5,0.9857
Green,"Great IPA. Review below mine is almost my exact thoughts. Strong alcohol content but doesn't taste it, and one of the least bitter IPAs I've had. I'm not going to pretend like I can taste every note or flavor, but it's fruity, and smooth. I let someone who's doesn't typically like IPAs try it, and they loved it. Another great Treehouse beer. I don't think it's quite as good as their Julius, but it's pretty damn close.",0.6219401705742633,4.5,0.9857
Black Tuesday,"Opened a bottle today that I obtained direct from brewery last Dec. It has been stored at 36F most of the time. I had a taste of another bottle in December, and it immediately reminded me of BCBS, but with some difference in character. It had a more pronounced dark fruit flavor. After 8 months of cold storage, I finally tried my bottle, and it immediately grabbed me with its strong, mellow flavors, and its similarity to BCBS. I now find it better than BCBS, as it seems to have stronger flavors. Beautiful dark, sweet flavors of raisins and plums, along with strong bourbon and barrel flavors, plus a good dose of alcohol. Label says it ""contains alcohol"". No kidding.  Tastes very much of alcohol, perhaps too much for some people, but I like it in small amounts. Takes 3 days of dedicated effort to finish a bottle. I'm about half way through this one after 2 days. Seems to last quite well with fridge storage after opening, no doubt due to high ABV. There is little carbonation to begin with, and no perceptible change in flavor profile after a couple days of bottle being opened.  Really tremendous stuff, and I'll have to see about getting some more.",0.6282518100202866,5.0,0.9857
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"Deep brown in color and clear on the edges with a nice ring of head. Minor lacing on a swirl.  Nose is sweet, bourbon, vanilla, and a bit of molasses.  Taste is bourbon, oak, vanilla, molasses, minor booze, and sweetness.  Mouthful is medium but surprisingly a touch thin. Carbonation is average. Finish is sweet.  Wow. A super bourbon forward stout that retains its balance. Exceptionally drinkable at 11%. Drawbacks are maple that is not really present until warm and even then it's low and the mouthful being thin but that is par for Jackie O's. All in all a very enjoyable stout.",0.6908053405437149,4.0,0.9857
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Poured from a bottle dated 2/11/15 into a tulip.  Appearance: Turbid, hazy yellowish-orange color, with a bright white head. Tons of lacing, that lingers on the glass throughout drinking. Excellent retention.  Smell: Very juicy and tropical smelling, much like Vicinity from Trillium. A hint less than Vicinity, but still very pleasant. A somewhat prevalent weedy, resinous aroma in the background of the fruit.  Taste: Most of the juicy citrus flavors come through first, tasting like mango and tangerine. Finishes a little bit bitter, but the tropical flavor is still there.  Taste: Delicious. I get some light biscuity malt, with heavy citrus rind and juice flavors. Stays true to the style in that it delivers a relative juice-bomb with some weedy, residual bitterness as well. The overwhelming flavor, though, is the citrus and tropical fruit.  Feel: Quite medium-bodied compared with stickier IPAs, but smooth at 7.1% ABV. Tastes linger for a short period of time on the palate.  Overall: A REALLY, REALLY good IPA. I liked it just as much as Congress St. but less so than Vicinity, comparing to other Trillium offerings. If it was more closely available to me, I'd drink it all the time.",0.7040785165802945,4.5,0.9857
Madagascar,From bottle. Pours an oily black. Good retention on head. Holy Madagascar vanilla bean. What a smell. Bourbon shines as it warms. This is fantastic. Vanilla bourbon excellence. Like a fancy dessert. Make this an ice cream. Good level of carbonation but this is straight velvet. Wow. This is an incredible beer. Unlike most milk stouts it's sweet but not overly so. Bourbon reins it back and the quality vanilla likewise provides a great flavor rather than an extracty sweetness.,0.6530294468270011,4.75,0.9856
Chocolate Rain,"2015. Teku pour. LOVE black tuesday but every other variant hasn't lived up to it yet. Hoping CR is the outlier.  L - thin murky brown like BT  S - alcohol and dark fruit. I smell zero of its proclaimed additions and honestly it just smelled like a less pronounced version of black tuesday. Disappointed here.  T - mmmkay. I see you chocolate rain. Massive amounts of milk chocolate overtop of black tuesdays dark fruit and ethanol. Chocolate covered cherries and plums washed down with faintly oaky, and mildly vanilla liquor. Not identifiable as bourbon, and almost more rum like due to its sweetness.  F - dry. Creamier than I believe black tuesday was. Hot (obviously).  O - hands down the best variant. I'd have to try it side by side with BT to decide which I like more but it certainly is better than grey monday, pb and thursday, and the worst them all... mocha wednesday.",0.563690815794712,4.75,0.9856
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"2018 vintage score. Very limited supply in western NY reportedly, as in like 6 cases...no love! Poured cellar temp assertively to a tulip glass. One finger dark brown head over a super dark body. Head burns down fast to a laser fine ring, with lots of legs when tipped. Nose is fudge, molasses, some oak barrel. First sips are heavy bourbon, some heat from the alcohol, followed by a wee bit of dark molasses and lots of barrel. Very crisp mouthfeel up front, but lingers with a nice sweet malty backend. Much different than the base Expedition IMO. It has a little burn, but in line with the bourbon character. Well-balanced with the bourbon always forward. Jealous that folks in Michigan can evidently buy a case at a time, while we have to suffer a 2 bottle limit. I’ve been back a few times to get some cellaring bottles. Surely time will make it even better. It’s a very easy drinker, pleasantly more bourbon than coffee or chocolate as many other super stouts favor. Bells, show us the bottles!",0.6349915036712279,4.5,0.9856
Society & Solitude #4,"Beer pours that of any HF IPA I've tasted. It's a light, hazy straw color with a fluffy white head. It has the same mysterious HF glow.   Best smelling ipa. Ever. This smells so good. Juicy fruits, straight up. Papaya, mango and pineapple. A complex, well-crafted juice, if you will. Well, not quite...  Tastes a lot like the smell. This is a super complex, fruity, tangy ipa. All the same fruit flavors that come in waves after each sip. There is some bitterness in the flavor, but it serves only to balance, not to overwhelm. I don't mind an overwhelming bitterness, but that isn't what this beer is about. I don't know how it's possible to achieve such a unique and distinct flavor profile in an ipa, but I'm sure it's some brilliant combination of the galaxy, citra, and well water.   Mouthfeel is again typical of HF IPAs; and by typical I mean perfect. Creamy, rich, medium-full bodied. Insanely drinkable.   This is my second favorite ipa only next to Ephraim. The flavor profile between is is very different, but all the stand out features remain consistent between each brew. Shaun knows which elements to highlight and which elements to leave alone. Can't wait to try more and more.",0.7227811897363456,4.75,0.9856
Beatification,"Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with no head whatsoever. Looks like a very refreshing Chardonnay.  The aroma on this brew is top notch! Tart lemon flesh blended with green apples and white grapes. A very acidic sourness encapsulates the aroma and has a nice earthy vibe as well.  The taste follows the nose...lemon tartness, green apples and white grapes blended with an acidic sourness. Oaky characteristics shine through on the finish.   The mouthfeel is amazing. Light to medium in body with the perfect amount of carbonation with a clean, crisp, dry and sour finish. The sour finish lingers for days and days! So good!  Overall, this beer was worth the hype. Big thanks to my buddy Josh for getting this for me as a wedding gift. Major beer karma comin your way! This beer did it all without trying to do too much. Just amazing",0.6949669432265831,4.5,0.9856

Chocolate Rain,"The beer is black as motor oil.  The aroma has sweet vanilla, some alcohol, bourbon, sweet toffee and molasses, a familiar Black Tuesday aroma, but with punches of dark chocolate come through.  The flavor follows upfront of sweet chocolate and vanilla. Onto hints of bourbon. Toffee sweetness, dark fruits, and then a hit of alcohol on the finish.  Having had multiple vintages, '10 dulls the alcohol very well. '11 is still a bit hot. '13 was obviously the most hot, but the chocolate and vanilla shined through so well. Drink this fresh.  Definitely better than Black Tuesday and its variants. Lovely beer.",0.6204409066895229,4.5,0.9855

L- Really nice..the very tiny bubbles hang around forever...a beautiful dark brown with a slight hint of cream. Really nice retention here...  S- Nutty, cherries, dark fruits....  T- Outstanding!! Just perfect...nice and sweet but not cloying at all. Caramel and a slight toffee with a tiny bitterness..very pleasing.

Chocolate Rain,"Very dark brown, head is immediately give.  Alcohol & cacoa nibs, nothing that I usually recognize as roasted malt.  60% to 70% cacoa with a bourbon filling. Complexity is not a Hallmark but the few flavors stand out. A dose of smoke or char might help but it's not s'mores, it's fuckin Chocolate Rain. Sweetness is pronounced as it should be, not a hint of lactose but intensely rich. Burn is off course there and if course welcomed. This is FLAC Jimi Hendrix in a dark room and my brain's not working that hard to turn sound/flavor to image/emotion. This is nectar, this is perfect... but Treehouse's Good Morning is better. Believe that.  Closer to under carbonated barleywine for sure. Syrupy sorta, staining for sure.",0.6492661919565783,4.75,0.9853
Aaron,Had on tap at HFB after bottle run. Absolutely extraordinarily perfect high octane version of a English Barleywine. Had a beautiful if brief light tan head; excellent residual lacing. Rich tawny orange- ruby accented color. Like a beautiful piece teak. Both simple and then complex to light. Nose was rich with toffee/caramel; wood; vanilla; soft herbal flower and bitterness. Taste magnified all these and slowly revealed tannins; slight hints of licorice; apple; and allspice as it warmed. Sweetness but never candy or cloying. Traces of whiskey helped round out flavors but well in background. Feel was luxuriantly soft and smooth; very mildly dense like young port but never thick or distracting.  Oh and $4 for 4oz glass????  Absurdly good beer and very accessible cost. Barreled EBW is one of my favorite styles ... and Aaron is without question the best I’ve ever had.

Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Wow....just wow. As a Californian who just received a box full of Tree House & Trillium beers all canned and bottled within the same month, all I can say is WOW. You can keep the Pats and the Sox, I just want your breweries!  Bottle on date was smudged, but I can make out that this was bottled in October. Today is October 17th. As fresh as I'm going to ever have this beer. Nose and taste mirror each other perfectly. Melons, Guava, passion Fruit, hint of bubble gum. Light Pine on the back end keeping this dry on the finish, but upfront nice and juicy. Soft pillowy mouthfeel, while the carbonation and bitterness is perfect here, keeping the finish sharp, crisp and effervescent. This keeps you coming back for sip after sip after sip.

Pungent tropical hop aroma. Notes of melon, mango, cantaloupe, rounded out by a very floral hop scent. The fruit is well on display here.   This beer is simply delicious. It's basically like a fruit punch IPA. 8% totally hidden. Lets see, mango, melon, kiwi, pineapple, just incredibly juicy flavors. Incredibly well rounded bitterness to this. Again the floral hop profile here is perfect for the fruity flavors. Amazing.   3/4 medium bodied brew, 1/4 light bodied. Coates and sticks to your mouth. Just enough prickly carbonation, but not overly carbed.   So I made a Vermont/MA trip in June to hit Alchemist, Hill Farmstead, and Tree House on my way into MA. I stopped at Waitsfield Village Grocery to get a case of Heady, which was freaking awesome that I could do that, and saw this beer there as well. I didn't know anything about it accept the store owner telling me it was really good. I only picked up 2 four packs of this, and I really regret not doing my homework on this beer. I haven't had the HF's I bought from my trip yet, but this ended up being my favorite beer from the entire trip. I will make it a point to get this if possible the next time I'm up there.",0.6487251138152552,4.75,0.9852
Nelson,"A-pours a straw yellow with a dense bright white head that lasts forever and leaves some lacing  S-tropical fruits and a slight hint of pine when first poured-as it opens the nose becomes more dank  T-tropical with just maybe the slightest hint of pine in the end-very hoppy and bitter for a standard IPA. A little dank as it opens and a slight malt backbone. There is a slight white wine characteristic to it. It is not incredibly complex just a hoppy west coast style IPA. I didn't notice the rye as much as I had hoped.  M-Pretty thick, but has a good level of carbonation  D-This is a pretty big IPA given the bitterness and alcohol content for the style. I couldn't drink more than this one bomber in a sitting.  Overall, this i is a very good beer. I don't know if I would say it is great, but it is a classic representation of the west coast style. I am glad I was able to try it, but I do not see myself buying a bomber again because I can get IPAs I enjoy as much, if not more, for a better price. Truly a must try for lovers of the style.",0.6631260097887829,4.25,0.9852
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Reviewing the Oude Geuze Vintage 2003 from Brouwerij Drie Fonteinen out of Belgium.  Score: 95  Bottle is dated 03/05/03. Served in a Drie Fonteinen fountain tumbler and enjoyed on 05/28/14. Thank you Paul for sharing this treat!  Appearance: Pours a murky golden yellow color with a slight brown tinge and a thin layer of head that totally settles. Poor lacing and retention. This looks like your typical 3F Oude Geuze. 4/5  Smell: Musty lemon, cedar/wood, and a light barnyard funk. Residual ""brightness"" relative to the citrus character is fresher vintage OGV's. Reminisce (perhaps just because of the cedar/wood character) of Blauw, but with less complexity/zing. 4.5/5  Taste: Funkier than the nose, particularly on the finish. Tart lemon bite, must, grain, peach, and a little spice. Faint wood character on the finish. Lasting musty lemon on the finish. 4.5/5  Mouthfeel: Medium-light bodied, good carbonation. Juicy mouthfeel with a nice gum-dryness to the finish. Nice tart bite with good linger. 4.5/5  Overall: The six year old bottle of 2007 and 2008 OGV that I have previously sampled still reign king among the different vintages of OGV sampled, but this still drank quite nice. Relative to the non-OGV Oude Geuze 2004 recently sampled, this vintage bottle had more zing despite being a year older. The OGV series is a testament to proper storage and the reliability of Armand's personal stash. I most recommend acquiring OGV 2008 or OGV 2007, but the OGV 2003 is also quite recommendable as well.  Cost: $40 for a 750 ml bottle.",0.6440415993008872,4.5,0.9852
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Bottle: Had this a few Sundays ago, combining my notes with this tasting: A mocha head of about a finger tops the body that has a distinct absence of color. It poured like a thin oil from the bottle, and a not very vigorous pour generated that creamy head. The light tan foam doesn't leave, and suspends larger bubbles in its creaminess.  A good whiff yields a combined coffee, vanilla, chocolate scent. I recall a little more coffee from a few weeks back, but it might be memory or environment more than it fading. In both cases, it comes together leaning towards a chocolate brownie. There's a light bitter note that could be dark roast coffee or a hint of charred malt.   Feel is a bit more oily today, versus the smooth, creamy feel I got a couple weeks back. The vanilla I got before is not as present up front, but the bourbon and roasted notes come out up front. The coffee forms in the mid-taste, filling out the body a bit and leading to that chocolate brownie like impression overall. In my original notes, I had a light tang and dryness from the barrel grabbing the edges by the end. In this sitting, I am getting some of the dryness, but not so much the barrel. Instead I am getting a light oily nutty aspect. Overall, though, it is still a dark chocolate cocoa impression. What I do get, with warmth, is the coffee making subtle inroads into the chocolate taste.  I really enjoyed this beer, as you got a little bit of all the expected notes playing together. The bourbon seems to lead to a more chocolatey flavor. However, the coffee was well integrated, and adds a richness and darkness to the chocolate. I almost miss the coffee as I indulge in the richness of the beer, though it is not hiding all that hard.",0.665520810063412,4.5,0.9852
Todd The Axe Man,"A - Cloudy orange body, with tiny white flakes suspended within, a full head, and extensive lacing.  S - A huge nose of tropical and citrus, mango and orange, grapefruit, and a hint of pine.  T - Superb front of fruit, broad and punchy, pineapple and orange flesh, a bit of mango, a middle which turns orange notes more orange cream soda as the malt kicks in, and a close that is strong and bitter, zest, with fruit lingering through the close.  M - Very brisk, with a sharp tingling resin build, but a close that clears the board enough that there is very little build.  O - This is a tremendous, thunderous IPA, with huge flavors, strong, pungent, and a rich, satisfying feel. Lovely and fun.",0.6927007647820907,4.5,0.9852
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Batch 3 (2016), Bottle #882. 12 oz bottle split three ways into TG tulips.   Upon opening, immediate maple syrup aromas fill the area. Pours a jet black, oily body with a small brown head that reduces quickly. The surface has a slick and oily texture.   Once in the glass the aromas intensify, with some coffee and bourbon coming through now, but maple syrup still dominates. It's odd, this smells more like maple syrup that actual maple syrup. Not artificial in the least bit.   Taste is pure and smooth, rich maple and bourbon fudge, more maple, sweet but not cloying, finishing with roasty coffee notes. Mouthfeel is what put this beer at the top for me. Rich, thick, velvety, easy.   I've never given a beer all 5's, but I can't find any flaws here. The thicker body puts it a hair above Good Morning.   To put the intense maple flavor profile of this beer in perspective, my kitchen still smelled like maple syrup the next morning.",0.6568626477895173,5.0,0.9852
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"750 ml corked and caged bottle, bottled on date of 28-04-2010. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a ruby red/purple color with a very small light pink head. Head retention is low, and there's also a small amount of lacing. Aroma is tart cherries, barnyard funk, vinegar and some oak. I think the taste is just like the aroma, it's all tart cherries, funk, vinegar and oak. The sourness isn't overpowering at all, but it's a pretty good tasting brew. There's also a lingering tart finish. The beer just tastes better and better the longer I drink it. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it has medium/high carbonation and it's somewhat slick and very easy to drink. I think it's a pretty good overall brew, and it would be interesting to see how this one ages. My only complaint about this beer is the price at $33.99 a bottle. But even then I don't think I was ripped off for the price, and I would likely buy this again at the same or similar price if I come across it.",0.6468340740064514,4.5,0.9852
Swish,"16oz can served in a snifter glass. Pours a hazy lemon orange body with a one finger thick frothy white head, great retention, lots of rings of lacing. Smell is rich citrus, grapefruit and orange; light zest on top of a mild amount of caramel and minimal sugar sweetness. Awesome. The nose just bursts with aroma, this is what makes a NE IPA what it is, not the haziness. Flavour follows, rich citrus and grapefruit, mild sweetness from the grain, but overall mostly fruit-forward with a nice balance with the dextrin/sugar malt sweetness and the mild resinous bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, appropriately carbonated and just altogether too good to put the glass down for any extended period of time. Very good NE double IPA, one of the best representations of the style.",0.7085445276429819,4.5,0.9852
Nelson,"Pours a golden-amber haze with a medium thick foamy white head. Good retention and lacing left behind. Citrus and dank hop aromas right up front. Slight resin hop tinge in the back ground. Smells like good things are going to come. Taste is incredibly well balanced, with fantastic notes of citrus, dank hops, and a splash of orange and lemon at the end. Fantastic. Mouth feel is smooth and filling. It has a great consistency to it that makes it feel like it could be served as a dessert course on a summer picnic, or downed pronto after a mountain bike ride. Overall, stupendous. Love the packaging on top of everything else. Just wish I could have it in 6 packs of cans or at least smaller bottles to take camping.   Served in a 12oz snifter.",0.6511969425606705,4.5,0.9851
Beatification,"Massive thanks to my cousin sonnysideup for sharing. An all-time top want for me. Batch 5.  A- Split from the bottle to a teku and a tulip with a murky, hazy golden appearance. A small pillow of frothy foam builds up upon pouring but falls to all but a tiny ring. A few legs stick but no true lace, looks like a gueuze.  S- Well this is going to be sour... Massive sour lactic and lemony tartness right off the top. Vinous oak barrels although there is no wine here from what I know. Some nice horsey funk as it warms.  T- Sour notes pick up to a vintage Cantillon or Hanssens, acidity just grips the taste buds and the entire mouth making my cheeks sore. Gueuze-like notes of lemons, vinous grapes, oak barrels, apples and even more lactic sourness. Some funk and grassy hay barnyard.  MF- Light bodied and immensely dry. As stated, a battery acid sourness lingers on the palate for many minutes after finishing. Moderate carbonation with a fizzy and somewhat silky texture.  Maybe the closest to a really good Gueuze I can think of coming out of America. I love Supplication and Consecration and this is a refreshing change to straight spontaneous ferment flavors. Sourness dominates but lots of other great flavors beyond that.",0.6738540265632845,4.5,0.9851
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"12oz bottle, packaged 6/2/2017. Served in a snifter glass 6/27/2017, so quite fresh. Pours a dark oily black body, thick one finger brown head, good retention, lots of lacing, thick collar that lasts quite a while. Smell is dark chocolate, bourbon, slight floral notes, vanillin, dark fruit, brownie batter, cocoa, even a touch of smoke. Dang, this is a classic barrel-aged stout with everything you'd ever want. Flavour is even better, with hefty dark chocolate and fudge presence, vanillin, brownies, cocoa, bourbon, oak, dark fruit, even a touch of roast malt, and a little bit of smoke. Super complex, and just about perfectly done. Mouthfeel is full bodied, chewy and thick, appropriate carbonation, with a slight smoky vanillin and chocolate finish, that is pretty much like s'mores. Wow, and I thought Black Note was good. Not sure why they'd ever think to blend this and barrel-aged DCS, this is about as good as it gets.",0.6689246494426151,4.75,0.985
Beatification,"Huge thanks to Jon for hooking me up with this loooong time Want (it's been on my Wants list for nearly 2 years). Batch 5.  Beer pours a hazy straw color with a moderate white head and minimal lacing. Aroma is fantastic, sour, oak, funk and citrus all blend fantastically, the oak really stands out and it has the funk smell of a Belgian lambic much more than your average American wild. Flavor is very sour and acidic initially, but is very complex. There's a great amount of oak and funkiness to this as well and it has some qualities that remind me of Drie Fonteinen Oude Gueuze. It comes off somewhere between a wild and a gueuze. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and coats your mouth very nicely. Overall, this is really a fantastic American wild that may come closest to the Belgian style it's modeled after of any American beer I've had. I'm a big fan and glad to have finally gotten a chance to try this after all this time.",0.6579168582700693,4.5,0.985
Nelson,"beer monger just got these for the holiday so I had to put in basket - pours a gorgeous golden orange deep hazy color with great foamy head that dissipates well smell is very tropical: ripe mangoes and clementines for a great citrus approach very little malt taste is taste you get that tropical taste and a definite rye background which i was surprised to be able to decipher taste continues to develop as the beer warms. feel is very appropriate for taste, holds it all together great carbonation level. overall a very good beer, would definitely get again.",0.6860787971206743,4.0,0.985
Juicy,"Thanks to jfmamj for sending this one my way.  Beer pours a very hazy golden-orange with a big white head. Gusher alert - this started pouring out of the bottle immediately. Smell is a fantastic blend of wine barrel, brett and hops. It reminds me a lot of E. in a good way. Flavor follows the nose as all the same elements are present in wonderful balance. The wine barrel and brett hit you first, but it's got a great citrus character that emerges halfway through followed by a fairly bitter, orange-rindy hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and mouth-coating, really quite nice. Overall this is a really well-done, complex saison that's one of Hill Farmstead's best. I'd say it's right up there with CD1 and E. It kinda comes off like a junior version of Mimosa that incorporates all of its elements even better. Well done Shaun!",0.6757784532630001,4.5,0.985
Enjoy By IPA,"Enjoy by 4/20/16, bottled 3/16/16. Enjoyed 3/21/16. An outstanding DIPA, nothing really so special as to put it in that world class category in my opinion, but It is no doubt a very very good IPA. Enjoy by Unfiltered is a better and perhaps world class beer, but it is a league above this. This is still an outstanding DIPA and my rating is only so high because I took into consideration how easily they are attained versus other outstanding DIPAs of similar class.",0.5765522055660458,4.25,0.985
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Let's start this revew by saying that I have never had a Toppling Goliath brew before, this was my first. I am not a local, it took me 3 1/2 hours to drive here from Waukesha, WI. I can't buy TG in my area. I only state that as I feel many people are attributing the great scores on Mornin' Delight and KBBS to homerism.  Appearance - Deep blackish brown with a perfect one finger, medium brown head.  Smell - Aromas of dark roast coffee, whiskey, and a mild sweetness all jump out of the glass.  Taste - Wow, very complex. Tasty coffee, mellow whiskey, and a sweet maple syrup taste all intermingle on the palate. Some nice vanilla notes. Finishes with the dark roast of the coffee. For a 13% brew, the alcohol on this is very light. Delicious.  Mouthfeel - Incredibly smooth, no harshness from the coffee or the whiskey. Nice viscosity.  Overall - I was blown away by this beer. I had high expectations, which usually leads to disappointment. Not in this case. The brewery is aptly named, this beer is a BCBCS and KBS killer.   Edit - The only reason I didn't give this a 5/5 is there was literally just a touch too much sweetness in the midpalate for me. Nitpicking, I know.  Edit Edit - After thinking this over, it deserves a straight 5. Equally as good as any other beer I have ever had, and better than most.",0.6538847667577816,5.0,0.985
Sip Of Sunshine,Poured from a 16 oz can (canned 12/16/2016) into a Veil Brewing house glass.   Appear: dark orange with a slight haze but can see some light coming through the glass. nice tight bubble foam.   Nose: nice. citrus notes peel maybe a little pith. mainly grapefruit. there's a nice malty note. little bready. maybe a little tropical fruit and herbal dankness there as well. the nose is not HUGE or overwhelming.   Taste: Wow. THat's really tasty. Really well balance. there some nice citrus and tropical fruit notes that go to a citrus ptih bit and then there's a malty piney note that brings it all together. It's a little hot on the back end which I'm surprised considering my can has a solid 6 weeks on it. unlike alot of other NE IPAs I've had you can taste the 8% which is why I'm dinging it down to a 4.25 vs. 4.75  Mouth: medium light. slight cream. I dig it.   Over: First Lawson's and first Sip. I really like it. I'll continue to trade for it. It's not a hazy juicy hop bomb. But just a really nice well balanced IPA.,0.6733335824849075,4.5,0.9849
Chocolate Rain,"Batch 2 poured into a Cigar City snifter  Appearance ~ Deep Black/Brown with a small amount of Tan head.   Smell ~ BOURBON, Chocolate, BOURBON, vanilla, BOURBON and some nice almond notes. In case you didn't catch the bourbon, I thought my nose was going to catch on fire it smelled so strong.  Taste ~ This baby is hot, really hot. Chocolate and sugar are really nice, its a good sweet, and not too sweet. Only problem I have with the taste is the overwhelming booze. Great taste after you get past the alcohol.  Mouthfeel ~ Nice, still a little hot, but the aroma hangs around nicely.  Overall ~ This is a quality brew. I think if I have another, i'll hang on to it for a minimum of 3 years before I drink the next one so the hardcore booze calms down. CR is Black Tuesday with cocoa nibs. It's good, but I would have just saved the cocoa and put out more Black Tuesday, BT is much better at hiding the heat. BT is just much better period.",0.5918182212408756,4.5,0.9849
Beatification,"This beer pours a nice yellow color, not to much haze and a thin white head that dissipates quicly.  the smell is funky, with some good barnyard notes, and hints of hay. there is also a lot of sourness that comes through in the smell.  the taste is punch you in the face sour. way more so than i was expecting. you also get a bit of sour apple and cheese hints but the main thing here is super sour.  the mouthfeel is thin dry and fleeting. the mouth waters not only because i want more, but because it is trying to protect my teeth with a bit of saliva to keep them from melting.  overall this is an excellent beer, I love the sour, but wish i could taste past it. i would definitely trade for it again.",0.6379833439722778,4.5,0.9849
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"2009 vintage served at the Brickskeller 3Floyds tasting with Barnaby as the speaker (5 oz pour). A: Jet black with no head and thin dark brown lacing S: Incredible aromas of oak, bourbon (Woodford Reserve barrels), and chocolate. T: Wow, this is as good as it gets for a bourbon barrel stout. It's not overly sweet like I was expecting (based on 2009 Dark Lord). There are huge vanilla, oak, bourbon, dark fruit, and milk chocolate flavors - all in harmony. Also, a hint of coffee and caramel comes through, giving it an added complexity. M: Mouthfeel is thick, but not as thick as bottled Dark Lord. It is, however, very creamy, velvety smooth and coats the mouth very well. D: The only knock on this beer is the slight alcohol burn - you can tell it's 13% (or more). Overall this is one of the best bourbon barrel stouts out there, and I feel so lucky to have gotten the opportunity to try it outside of Dark Lord Day. Big thanks to Barnaby and Nick for bringing it to the Brickskeller tasting!",0.6239828598950432,4.5,0.9849
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"B2 April 4, 2017  pours out a mostly clear brilliant golden straw color, creamy bright white head with suds atop and great retention. aromas of lemon, hay, fresh cut grass, floral, oak, mellow earthy funk, spice and bright citrus peel in there. on palate there is the above mentioned notes with even more depth and coherence. quite a pungent hit of fruity citrus and fuzzy peach flavor dancing in there, almost invoking characteristics of a NEIPA. but there is this beautiful funky dryness and oak character to balance it out. hay, fresh cut grass, lemon peel, musty grape skin, white grape, mellow acidity, oaky sweetness hinting at vanilla. the feel is so effervescent and crisp, wonderfully complimenting the flavor profile.",0.7151728599898088,5.0,0.9848
Society & Solitude #4,"The last of my HF growlers, and hopefully the best. 750 ml growler into a tulip.  A - The same as all the rest. Seriously, every HF IPA looks exactly the same. A pale, hazy yellow-orange with a bright, pillowy white head. Nice.  N - Hmm, I like these hops. The nose is tropical fruit and citrus, with no bitterness at all. And that's my favorite kind of IPA - hoppy but not bitter.  T - Good! Definitely a tad more bitter than the nose, but I get the bright, juicy floral hops, plenty of citrus. A very nice example of the style.  M - HF always nails it here. Frothy and coating everywhere. Always impressive.  O - I pretty much give all of their IPAs the same grade, and I'll do the same here. Another great one.",0.6447545056228652,4.0,0.9848
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Had on tap at the pub of three floyds on Dark Lord Day 2010.  A-pours a completely black, opaque, motor oil looking liquid that is thick and viscous looking. Tan colored head that is tight, thick and creamy. Some light retention and lace  S-the nose is amazing, bourbon forward and right up front. Notes of vanilla and oak set in next with some nice dark chocolate and notes of espresso.  T-The bourbon and vanilla oakiness comes in right up front. Tons of dark chocolate set it next melding with the vanilla from the oak, chocolate brownie. Sweetness takes over, but in a soft well orchestrated way. Anise turns to dark cherries and plums with a hint of alcohol in there to let you know how big this is.  M-this is the biggest stout I've ever had. It is huge, somehow bigger than any dark lord and bigger than the vanilla bean that I sipped right next to this. It should be higher than a five if possible. It is extremely smooth and creamy, soft on the palate, this needs a knife to get through it in the best of ways.  D-this is the best stout I have ever had. This is also the best beer I have ever had and is in a league of it's own. Beers could potentially get a higher rank with me b/c of the typically lack of head retention and lace of Dark Lord; but it will take quite a brew to ever top this!",0.653548423554389,5.0,0.9848
Haze,"thanks so much to tenderbranson69 for sharing this -from the can in a tulip chilled.  I had taken a long walk and this slaked my thirst in just the right way.  The color is like fresh pressed juice with white head and fine bead with lots of lace clinging in rings with good retention. The smell is so juicy-you might believe there is actual fruit in this - very tropical! the smell has a citrus quality with lemony and lightly grassy zesty smell that brings out herbal and subtle stone fruit accents. The feel is great - fruity and tangy with medium carbonation and semi-sweet entry yet juicy tangy and bitter balances out with a semi-dry yet very light astringent aspect with a long hop finish.  The taste is as great as the smell hints at just a lovely mix of sweet citrus and tropical fruit flavors in the hops with a very mild malt to supplement that juicy taste and soft bitter accent with a more herbal/sweetgrass taste in the back with malt and bitterness more balanced in order that there is no alcohol in the taste. Overall I found this to be smooth, drinkable fresh and lively as far as the intensity of the hop flavor and it is very quaffable for a 8.2% beer I was able to sip and enjoy this very easily looking forward to future tastes of this fine brew.",0.7165033531372373,4.5,0.9847
Todd The Axe Man,"Pours a brilliant bright orange with good carbonation. Huge tropical aroma with slight pine. One of the best beers to nose. Tastes of pineapple, citrus, and orange.

Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"A 2014 bottle from the reserve collection at Jackie O’s production brewery served in a snifter.   Look- A dense black with a little less than a finger of dark mocha head. Surprised that there was virtually no lacing with this one.   Smell- Tons of vanilla, maple, and bourbon with a nutty aroma mixed in. The barrel doesn’t really dominate like I expected.   Taste- I’ll start by saying wow! The vanilla and bourbon mix is fantastic. The hazelnuts and chocolate are there, too. The maple has mellowed with age but probably gives some of the sweetness.   Mouthfeel- Light carbonation with a creamy smooth finish. The subtle sweetness hangs around with every sip.   Overall- A great offering from Jackie O’s. Not certain about this being a porter but it was still great. Definitely worth the trip.",0.6633322408064645,4.5,0.9847
Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Pours a hazy, lemon-orange body, one finger white head with very nice retention and thick rings of lacing. Looks very much as I expected it to. Smells of lemon, must, hay, oak, a fair bit of cheese, citrus, tart green apple. Nice complexity, very refreshing nose. Flavour is similarly lemon-forward, oak, citrus, hay, funk, a mild bit of cheese. I remember batch 1 being a little bit cheesier, but this has dialed up the lemon and citrus. Very tasty and nice flavour profile. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, crisp, refreshing, wonderfully lemon-forward with a nice mild juiciness on the finish, very drinkable. Overall, loved this one a lot and would happily drink again.",0.7093125215705715,4.75,0.9847
Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Thanks to Josh for this one. Reviewed at a tasting 8/1/15. From notes. Into a branded teku.   Pours a .5 finger foamy white head with good retention. Beer is a cloudy goldenrod. Lacing is spotty and patchy with good stick. Nice head but the color suffers a bit.   Nose is Brett funk, lemon, a touch of peppercorn, dandelion, sweet citrus. Aromatic, lively and tart.   Opens citrus and lemon zest. Peppercorn, Brett and oak in the middle with cobwebs and foam towards the end. Aftertaste of bright citrus fruits and spices. Sweet, tart and mellow with great balance.   Light bodied with ample carbonation. Prickly and lively in the mouth and goes down aggressive but soft and dry at the same time. Filmy aftertaste. Really drinkable.   SARA's been very impressive with all their offerings and Cellarman is no different... like a West Coast Hill Farmstead barrel-aged Saison.",0.6851772320274513,4.25,0.9847

Pretty much all hops with pine, floral, and citrus all up in your face. Grassy and spicy underneath. The citrus is mango forward with lemon trailing.  4.0 T: Mild-moderate bitterness. Resiny and sticky hoppiness. Shrubbery, evergreen sap, pine, again with mango citrus. Spicy finish. Alcohol is detectable throughout, but isn't overbearing. Bready malts underneath with light caramel notes.  4.25 M: Heavier medium body. Good moderate carbonation with a pleasant creaminess that lays well on the tongue.

Green,"poured from 16 oz glass into Veil House Glass. Canned on 11-21-2016.   Appear: poured a beautiful hazy light citrus with about a fingers worth of off white dense foam. gorgeous.   Smell: DANK. maybe obvious but damn that smells nice. IT's a nice blend of citrus and piney notes. A little grassy there's some grapefuirt pith going on. some tropical notes but they're subtle. I'm getting much more green herbal notes   Taste: alot of grapefruit pith on the palate. bitter. THis is definitely the ""hoppiest"" NE style brew I've had. It has all the NE style characteristics but with an almost West COast flavor. More piney citrus notes. I don't get alot of orange or mango flavors that you normally get from some NE stlyes. Can notes that Galaxy is the main hop here. Creamy bitter yummy.   Feel: Smooth delicious feel. Not too creamy just a nice amount. But it's like a creamy bitter.   Over: INteresting brew. I really like it. It's only my second by TH but I like it. It has alot of notes from well made West Coast IPAs that I kind of miss since I've gotten more into NE style brews and so to find those notes in a creamy mouth is nice.",0.6671679237222554,4.25,0.9847
Green,"Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass (1 month old). Appearance is hazy yellow/brown with some orange around the middle, two finger thick head with pretty good retention. Smell is floral and earthy hops, with notes of tangerine, resin, grass, wheat, pineapple and hay.  Taste follows the nose except with a surge of earthy tangerine juice coming through. There is moderate resiny sweetness that melds everything together and fairly low bitterness. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy with good body upfront and a great bite on the finish, flavors linger on and on.   Overall, this is one of the top two IPAs I have had, the other being Haze. The juicy and earthy hop flavors are unreal (good representation of Galaxy), yet the drinkability and balance are great. The bitterness is perfectly placed, and there is just enough sweetness. Green is a great complement to Haze and Julius in which the flavors are more different than I expected, about perfect all the way around.",0.7170772589556421,5.0,0.9847
Sip Of Sunshine,"Acquired from marino13412 so a big “Thank You” goes out to him. Poured from a 16oz can into a US tumbler pint glass.  A: The beer is a deep gold color with a short off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick but spotty lace on the glass.  S: The aroma contains grassy hops, fruity citrus and caramelized malts.  T: The taste starts out sweet with flavors of caramel and fruity citrus. Then a strong but not over-powering grassy hops bitterness comes in and strengthens as you continue to drink the beer. The malt character is hearty and brings a very good balance. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet.  M: Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.  O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a very good 2IPA to pound down for a long time.",0.7045310896005065,4.5,0.9847
Beatification," bottle poured into a RR -ion glass. Review #900, saved a big one!  A - Pours a cloudy golden-yellow with a dense white head that settles to a slight pillowy haze. S - Complex, gueuze-like aromas of cheesy funk, lemon zest, white wine, oak, and green apples. Becomes much more lactic as it warms up, almost like a creamy lemon yogurt. Beautiful, and so very Russian River in execution. T - Nicely tart, puckering even, with lemon juice, green apple, and unripe pear leading to a astringent woodiness and more cheesy funk. Amazingly drinkable despite the apparently high levels of lactic and citric acid, this is a lovely balance of tart, musty, earthy, and funky. Certainly blended with a deft hand. M - Crisp, with a medium body, effervescent carbonation, and a dry finish that leaves your teeth squeaking. O - Another amazing Russian River Wild Ale, as if there was any doubt. While Supplication remains my favorite, this was the one I was most excited to try, and it certainly met my expectations!",0.6979876063299305,4.5,0.9847
Aaron,"L: Dark brown pour with minimal head.  S: Predominantly raisins and booze in the most delightful way.  T: Very sweet with dark fruit notes and a heavy splash of bourbon heat to start, moving to notes of caramel and vanilla, then finishing strong with nutty flavors as the beer warms.   F: Super thick and viscous. The best of any beer in recent memory.   O: A phenomenal beer. Terrifically well balanced. Outstanding flavor. The best barleywine I have ever tasted. The draft version (served at the HF anniversary event) might be the only barleywine I have ever had that approached a full 5-out-of-5 mark.   Edit: 2018  Having now had Batch 1, Batch 2, and Batch 3, I think that Aaron still holds the top spot for me in the barleywine category, although BCBW '13 and ADWTD have both clocked in with similar numbers in side-by-side tastings.",0.6676619933235459,4.75,0.9847
Juicy,"HUGE thanks to bevdaddy for grabbing me a bottle of Juicy on his recent trip...  375ml bottle poured into (what else) a Hill Farmstead balloon glass.  Appearance: Well-chilled bottle gushes up very slightly on open, though not as bad as the rumors. Color is somewhere between a dirty gold and a dark orange. Head is surprisingly thin, though I poured it tenderly after the bit of gushing. Great lacing.  Smell: Grapefruit and a strong brett-y funk dancing together in my nose. Hops are there, and prominent for the style, but take a backseat. If I strain I can get the oak.  Taste: Tastes like it smells. The grapefruit and brett have found their perfect match. Citrus flavored hops on the backend are potent, but the lingering aftertaste is brett. Oaky, earthy, barnyard/hay, and fruit. Not sour at all, just funky, and a slight tart from the wine.  Drinkability: Really high. I only have one bottle, but I would buy this by the 6-pack if I could.   Mouthfeel: Moderate to high carb, medium body, a bit sticky on the back.  Overall: I'm not really sure what this beer is. Part saison, part Belgian IPA, part wild ale, but all good. It's very unique, and like most everything HF does, it's awesome. But, I feel Juicy only falls somewhere around average for HF. Chase after it if you are a brett fiend, but otherwise you could do just as well with their other saisons.",0.6469777952877622,4.5,0.9846
Beatification,"Serving Type: Draft Consumed: 10.2.15  A: 4.5 Pale golden-yellow. Slightly hazy. Minimal off-white head.  S: 4.25 Pretty mild. Lemon, funk, oak, and mild pepper. Almost like a gueuze with the volume turned down. Spontaneous fermentation still results in a classic Russian River quality, like temptation.  T: 4.5 Really nice balance of slightly sweet at the beginning to pleasantly tart in the middle and finish. More lemon, funk, oak and grass. Finish is slightly dry with little bitterness.  M: 4.5 Almost feels undercarbonated at first, but feels just right after a few sips. The beer is quite substantial for 6%, but the carb is just lively enough that it works.  O: 4.5 Pretty great sour from Russian river. Not quite as different from something like temptation as I was expecting, but that's definitely not a bad thing.",0.6790098431619561,4.5,0.9846
Oude Geuze Vintage,"33cl bottle at 't Brugs Beertje, this beer is labeled vintage, unlike their regular Oude Gueuze. Served in a Drie Fonteinen tumbler, the Oude Gueuze Vintage 2005 is a brassy dark gold with a pillowy off-white head that leaves almost no lace.   Smell is sour, lemongrass, hay, with a hint of sweet baby diaper as it warms.   Taste is fantastic, a nice tartness but relatively clean, very elegant, with some tropical fruit notes, like a very acidic white wine (sauvignon blanc), just awesome.   Mouthfeel is dry, acidic, medium-light bodied, well carbonated.   Drinkability is perhaps the highest of any gueuze I've ever had. Fantastic taste, with a satisfying but not overwhelming acidity, wow.",0.6714619851262513,5.0,0.9846
Madagascar,"Had this at a 4 Hands tap takeover at 44 Stone Public House. Kevin Lemp, the president of Four Hands was in attendance and actually bought me a pint of it. Wow, just wow. This beer is off the chain complex. The vanilla is very apparent, but not cloying. Lots of roasted character, with a big chocolate and coffee punch. And sure, the bourbon is there, but it blends nicely with the other flavors. The finish is velvety smooth. Despite being over 9%, the alcohol is virtually undetectable. As Kevin explained to me, "" we buy the best vanilla beans we can get. And we skin, disinfect and split every bean by hand before it goes in to the fermenter"". The attention to detail and dedication to perfection is mind blowing. World Class? Oh Yeah!",0.6432543612838988,4.75,0.9846
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Drank from a e37,5 cl corked and caged bottle purchased at De Bier Tempel, Brugge, Belgium Lotnummer 10/02/2005 Ten minste houdbaar tot: 02/2015 Served in a Drie Fonteinen tumbler  Brassy amber in appearance with crimson tinges. The slightly hazed liquid was topped by a tight, creamy, one-finger crown of eggshell colored foam. Over time, the head faded to a clingy ring of lace.  The aroma had tons of funky, musty barnyard character. Lots of wet hay. Grassy and quite lemony. Tart but not too acidic. Some Brett and critters. Fairly oaky. Mild sour cherry notes. Bit of crackery malts. There was also a touch of sweetness, which complimented the tartness quite well. Overall, quite intense and complex, yet still mellow and smooth.  The flavor profile was also rather impressive. A stiff, crackery malt base came through on the front end. Lots of wet hay and damp earth. Very musty and funky. Grassy in the center. Strong lemon rind notes were also apparent. This beer was definitely more bitter than sour. The finish was surprisingly hoppy, with the hops being earthy, pithy and quite bitter. Tons of oak and slightly acidic, vinegar-like notes came through as well. Very tannic and dry on the palate with some lingering wet hay, lemon and grapefruit rind notes. Overall, very complex. I was amazed by how funky and ""old"" the beer drank initially, yet how how hoppy and bitter it turned on the finish.  The mouthfeel was exceptionally smooth and creamy for the style. Medium-full bodied with a super fine, zippy effervescence.  Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze Vintage is a musty, funky and remarkably complex gueuze. The seven years of aging really seemed to soften any of the rough edges you might find in a younger example of the style. I paired this with some grassy, semi-soft goat cheese and would recommend others to do the same.  On a side note, I had this February 10, 2005 vintage alongside my girlfriend's April 12, 2005 bottle. I found my bottle to be slightly drier up front and much less pithy and bitter on the finish. It also had a much more plush mouthfeel. That said, I definitely preferred my bottle to hers.",0.6995388169464566,4.5,0.9846
Scaled Up,"Canned 10/4/16, pours extremely cloudy orange color with a 1 finger foamy off white head that was full of tiny bubbles and faded very, very slowly, leaving sticky lacing coating the sides as it eased down. The clarity was perfect New England style IPA with the cloudy orange looks.  Whoa, the tropical fruit hit my nose 6 inches from the glass...grapefruit, pineapple, orange peel, lemon, star fruit, mango, weed, fresh piney hops, biscuit, peppery spices, fresh cut flowers and/or fresh floral hops, and then a bready/cracker background that added some nice balance to the extremely fresh smelling citrus hops. Wonderful to inhale.  Tastes a lot like it smells with the intense citrus up front that includes grapefruit, pineapple, orange peel, lemon, star fruit, mango, clementine and every other citrus fruit you can imagine. It's dank and bitter at the same time with additions of zesty piney hops, peppery spices with a mix of white pepper, coriander and light cumin, and then flowers, pungent floral hops and a smooth finish like oats were used as part of the sturdy malt backbone. Nice amount of biscuit, graham cracker and toasted grain notes along with a touch of honey or something equally sweet. Really damn tasty.  Mouthfeel is smooth with light carbonation, a medium to chewy body which has texture, and a clean finish that seems to dry up after the bitterness starts to fade from the citrus assault. Much easier to drink than an 8% ABV DIPA should be.  Overall a great DIPA, it lived up to the hype. Thanks to 'Boccu' and Marcus for hooking me up with this can!",0.6844057574082528,4.25,0.9846
Madagascar,"22oz bottle poured into a snifter  A- pours a deep black color with a bit of light creeping in on the edge, small foamy white head that leaves a few patches of lace behind   S- charred malt up front brings aromas of chocolate, followed by burnt marshmallow, vanilla bean & sugar cookies. Barrel notes are subtle but give aromas of bourbon, vanilla & toasted oak. Slightly smoky close with milk sugar sweetness   T- marshmallow and vanilla open up followed by dark chocolate and vanilla whipping cream and milk sugars. Light barrel character gives hint of bourbon and toasted oak in the mid-palate, along with a trace of coconut. Finishes with more marshmallow and chocolate with a sweet linger  M- medium body and low carbonation leads to a slightly foamy mouthfeel that continues to the finish   O- the sweetness of the base milk stout compliments the vanilla addition very well, with the barrel character balancing the sweetness. One of the best milk stouts that I've had to date.",0.6486116500603709,4.5,0.9845

Coconut B-Bomb,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a Fremont beer can glass. Acquired in a trade.   Pours a deep brown body with a brown one finger head that sticks around for a bit and reduces to a ring of foam for the remainder of the 1 hour or so that I drank this.   Aromas are sweet and dessert-like, coconut macaroon, caramel, vanilla, boozy bourbon, toffee, molasses, brown sugar, all melded together to create a delicious medley.   Taste is as sweet as the nose suggests with sweet molasses and caramel-bourbon, dark chocolate dipped coconut, toffee, dark fruit and molasses, finishing sweet and syrupy, rich and indulgent. Roasty aftertaste. Medium body, not too thick and low carbonation.  Fremont cannot do wrong when it comes to stouts and strong ales. B-bomb is great, coconut B-bomb is even greater.",0.6364083216588783,4.5,0.9845
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"This is a good coffee stout, but it is blown way out of proportion due to its insanely limited availability and the fact that that availability makes it impossible to get a bottle without emptying your cellar. The beer looks great- black as night with a beautiful head. Smell is coffee and bourbon with a sugary sweetness behind it. The sweetness is present in the taste as well, creating a somewhat uncomfortable mouth feel. The coffee is outstanding, but the sweetness kills it for me. I'd take BCBCS over this every day of the week.",0.6342550236127723,3.25,0.9845
Haze,"What beautiful beer!  L: The name calls it. Lovely orange-cold, thick as juice and cloudy as glacial runoff. S: There's orange but also tropical fruit. I picked up a pine scent similar to how the pith of a mango has pine. T: Juice comes first and... wow! What took me by surprise is that the malt is detectable, too.  F: Just so damned smooth. Again, like glacial runoff, but juicy instead. O: Worth seeking this out via a trade.  Poured from a can to a tulip glass. Had side-by-side with Spirit Crusher, a similarly hazy DIPA from Seattle's Holy Mountain. Also from a can created about the same time! An interesting East-West experiment with both winning, in my opinion. The New England beer predictably nailed its own style with the aptly named Haze. And the West-coast brew brought Washington state hops to the table in a very similar style. I'd say Spirit Crusher might've been even more orange-juicier, just in the way that it was more like orange-juice concentrate. Maybe more hop bite, too. Like tasting a hop off the vine. ""Haze"" may have been slightly more refined, which is odd to say because both have punch and smoothness. Balance. And surprisingly similar beers!",0.6350480639630562,4.5,0.9844
Mastermind,"Consumed 10/15/14  A: Pours lightly cloudy (moderately cloudy if you pour in all the sediment at the bottom of the can) - honey tangerine color - pours with a small, white head, fades to wisps, leaves some nice spots of lacing  S: Very dank and fruity - extremely resinous, weed-like aroma - ripe, juicy, dank, and hoppy - big citrus component, with tangerine, orange, and grapefruit flesh - very floral - range of tropical fruits, pineapple, mango, straight-up tropical fruit juice aromas - base of lightly sweet, pale malts, and citrus rind  T: Hoppy and inexplicably easy to drink - not as potent as the aroma would suggest, but a really nice hop profile - very floral - bright tangerine and grapefruit flesh, pineapple, mango, ripe peach, other tropical flavors - medium level of bitterness - leafy, piney, and lightly earthy notes become apparent after the initial tropical citrus - pale malts and some sweetness, alcohol is well hidden  M: Medium body, very smooth, disturbingly quaffable, finishes with lingering hops  O: Masterful  Is it even possible to review this beer without mentioning Heady? No. The color scheme of the can, the name of the beer, and the whole ""Vermont"" thing cannot be ignored. But comparing this to Heady is not entirely fair, as I found this to be very different than Heady. It's aroma is less intense but more resiny and weedy than Heady. Overall, Mastermind is easier to drink (ironic that it currently only can be found in 12 ounce cans), but it's also not as flavorful. Regardless, Mastermind is awesome, assuming you drink it within a couple weeks of canning. The can I am currently reviewing is already less epic than a can I drank a few days ago. Find this beer fresh! It's worth it.  Edit: 6/21/16 Drinking a can of the June 2016 batch. This is a bit different than I remember. The citrus and tropical fruit is off the charts, and it has a cake-like sweetness. To an extent this now tastes like a cupcake with tropical fruit frosting. Not changing my scores because it's still amazing... just in a different way.",0.6924468037703726,4.5,0.9844

Absolutely amazing.  M - so hoppy and yet so easy drinking, light to medium mouth feel, alc covered completely, aftertaste is still more citrus, papaya, peach, pineapple O - damn good beer.

Beatification,"Big thank you to rrryanc and ArchEnemyBrew for both getting me a bottle of this, a huge want. Batch 5.  Appearance. Pours a clear, rich yellow gold with two fingers of bubbly white head that fades pretty quickly.  Smell. Strong woody funk and leather with traces of melons, apples, white wine and a touch of honey.   Taste. Really sour, tart lemon juice and cider vinegar with some leathery funk and musty, dank old wood. There's even a slight saltiness going on. Very, very nice (despite this description).   Mouthfeel. Medium+ body with medium+ lively but smooth carbonation.  Overall. An awesome brew. Very sour and really delicious. Enjoying it immensely!",0.6719792454681489,4.5,0.9844
Green,"A world of thanks to Brian for this one. Pint can dated 9/19/18 - poured into a tulip at 44f.   Pours a glass of pulpy fresh squeeze orange juice that has been whipped up in a blender. Opaque, shiny, glowing orange, with a finger of foamy head that reduces to a sudsy film and a collar. Looks like juice.   Nose is very ripe mango, ripe pineapple, naval oranges, hint of Meyer lemon, hint of guava, some grapefruit pith. There are some floral notes going on, but the one that's sticking out to me is some well hidden rosemary sprig. A big dose of late-hopped earthy dankness. Greeeen.  Palate shifts to notes of ripe dark berries, mango, some pineapple, subtle white grapefruit, and a very pine resin type bitterness. Lots of aromatic oils and terpenes. Getting a faint touch of that rosemary when the resinous bitter notes come through. Other vague juicy tropical notes round everything out. Finishes moderately bitter, but it's a nice oily bitterness. Very organic. Some complex flavors going on in this one.   Mouthfeel on this has to be a 5, in the world of IPAs. I think this rivals Julius. Thick, creamy, soft, luscious, pillowy, fluffy...the works. The very fine carbonation furthers that whipped feeling this has. It feels whipped, like an orange Julius. Thick and creamy, but also light, and fluid. Phenomenal mouthfeel. It doesn't get better than this. Juicy in the front, and drying in th back. Well done, Tree House.  Overall, my god, this is something. These people can really make a world-class IPA. I think this is going to replace Julius as my number one IPA. This is close to perfection. Top notch. As a side note, I had a super fresh can of Green the other day, and this is nearly as great. I also had a fresh Julius a while back and a 2 month old can of Julius, and it would seem that Tree House hops hold up amazingly well within the 2 month range. Not a lot of IPAs can say that.",0.6801915692293989,4.5,0.9844
Swish,"Poured out 16 oz can into Teku Glass  Appearance: About a finger of thin bubbly head that quickly dissipated. Beer is an extremely hazy, pretty much opaque light tangerine color; the quintessential ""new-age"" NE DIPA.   Aroma:  Oh boy. Super juicy and pungent peaches + pineapples.  Some orange sweetness in there as well (CITRA) Earthy dankness, very green Very little malt presence (if any!)   Taste: Follows aroma perfectly, peach pineapple juice. Nice zesty bitterness throughout the flavor (again, reminiscent of CITRA). Grassy Dankness on the back (Simcoe). Overall; super hoppy, like drinking a blended hop smoothie, with the hop acidity strongly present.  Feel: Medium body, well carbonated and moderately spritzy on the palate.  Overall: Excellent NE Double IPA, rather reminiscent of Trillium Brewing's hop profiles.",0.6982764080052949,4.75,0.9843
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2008 bottle, enjoyed 10/18/15. This is the absolute best lambic I have had to date. Appearance is bright ruby red, bottle gushed for about 5 seconds after opening but was caught in the glass as it was expected. 1"" pinkish head stayed around for quite some time. Nose is straight Cantillon funk with massive raspberries. Taste is better than I could have ever expected, definitely the funkiest, sourest, and most well balanced Loon I have had. The raspberry and funk just do not stop. Mouthfeel is bubbly heaven. So glad I traded for this older bottle and it knocked '14 Framboos out of the water in side by side tasting.",0.6232217278856809,4.75,0.9843

Acidic and vinous aromas, light wood, lemon, sour apple.   Mouth puckering and delightful. It's such a fun beer for those that enjoy sour. Lemon, acidic, wood, tart. Bursts with flavor.   Crisp and extremely sour on the palate. Abusive to the tongue. Sour like I'm going to get those little bumps on my tongue when I eat too many sour patch kids.   Love, love, love this beer.

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"This beer pours a very hazy, cloudy shade of honey gold with a huge, frothy, creamy white head that takes forever to recede to a half finger slightly rocky cap. There are many sticky spots of lacing left on the glass. Absolutely gorgeous.  The smell is excellent. Banana and clove are most apparent with peppery spice, bubblegum and wheat.  Taste is the same. The banana flavor comes on strong at the beginning, but is swept aside by clove and pepper on the finish.  Feel is medium bodied and very smooth. I wish there was a bit more carbonation.  Overall a great hefeweizen. Very flavorful, smooth and easy drinking. Definitely worth the price of admission and a must try for any fan of the style.",0.6758204030282403,4.5,0.9842
Scaled Up,"Pours a very cloudy bright orange gold color with a sudsy 3 finger biscuit head that settles to a soapy, large bubble froth.  The aroma is strong with citrus, nectarine and peach notes, maybe a touch buttery.  The taste is similar with a wonderfully fresh and mellow semi-sweet peach flavor coming through up front. This blends into a orange-peach medley and is really quite pleasant. There is a touch of bitter dankness in the finish but otherwise it stays true to the initial taste.  The feel is very soft and buttery with a more-than-average amount of seltzer to it. There is a slight alcohol burn in the finish.  This is just a fantastic flavor, teasing the peach flavors out beautifully and then blending it with orange to make for a superior flavor profile. Maybe one of my favorites from Trillium.",0.6990739219104128,4.5,0.9842
Sip Of Sunshine,"10/28/16 canning date  A: Clear amber pour. Tall frothy light tan head. Quite good head retention and mild lacing.   S: Floral and tropical fruit hop notes. Surprisingly not a huge aroma, it's shockingly subtle I'd say.   T: The taste, however, is not subtle. Layers of hop flavors. Absolutely bursting with tropical fruits. Pineapple and mango with a citrus kicker. Resinous, dank hops as well - more towards the middle. Floral in the finish and aftertaste, especially lingering between sips when nothing else is left.  M: Medium bodied, smooth and bitter.   O: Man, talk about a multi-layered IPA. It doesn't punch you in the face right off the bat, but the big bold flavors just keep coming and building off of each other all the way through. Great flavors, great balance, great in general.

Sip Of Sunshine,"DATE: June 16, 2017... OCCASION: the boys are out of school... time for a beer that suggests sunshine and summer... GLASSWARE: Victory Hop Devil nonick... lively light amber body that densely shields any vision through the glass... the white head laces beautifully above the beer line... mango, tangerine, and other tropical fruits combine with lemon and hay to draft a suggestion of an island summer... dangerously medium-bodied, subtle like low-eighties heat, and highly drinkable, belying its 8% ABV... a creamy body dissolves at the finish, with teeth tickled and slight bitterness rolling in... the feeling lingers, but as the label suggests, the lupulin eases you towards the next sip... the flavor profile is decidedly fruity, with passion fruit, mango, and grapefruit ripely on the tongue... slight balance is provided by malts that do not inhibit the experience... provides as clean a high as one can get from an IPA... this would be a dangerous one to have in case, as the ABV makes nowhere near the imprint it should... in fact, I love that Lawson's calls it an IPA, while the net IDs it as a DIPA--they just made their flagship stronger than the usual... big shout-out to Jeff for delivering this one as part of a four-pack treasure trove... having heard a lot of Lawson's, I can now say the introduction's pleasure was all mine...",0.6888539707060481,4.5,0.9842
Fort Point Pale Ale,"Pours a hazy peach coloration with a small, fizzy head. Smell is initially quite lovely, with hoppy, juicy tropical/citrus fruit notes of mango and passion fruit with a hint of pineapple and tangerine, but takes on a light cat piss note as it sits. Taste is very bright and hoppy, dominated sweet, juicy tropical fruit notes of mango, passion fruit and pineapple and with zesty citrus notes of grapefruit and tangerine. There's a light dankness and a hint of pine to this as well, almost no malt presence detectable though. Finishes with a light bitterness and very mild hop burn. Soft mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation. This is the quintessential NE style Pale Ale and I would say that it has an amazing juicy hoppiness, mouthfeel and depth of flavour for a Pale Ale, BUT is this even a Pale Ale at 6.6% ABV? Nonetheless, it's still an excellent beer at a relatively low ABV. The balance of sweet tropical fruit, zesty citrus fruit and dankness/pine really is outstanding here.",0.6858431514320683,4.5,0.9842
Beatification,"2012 Vintage  A: Deep yellow, excellent clarity with beautiful pinpoint carbonation. As appetizing as a beer can look!  S: Damp cotton, lemon candies, wet leaves, lactic twang. Smells very familiar as a Gueuze, but there's something unique about the profile. Perfect.  T: Lemons at first, then a big wave of smooth earthy brett character. Wool. An extremely dry and sour finish even by Lambic standards. Has a slight 'coarseness' in the aftertaste, but flawless aside from that.  M: Torrential carbonation and VERY dry. High drinkability, highly refreshing, I love this beer.  So glad I finally got a chance to try Beatification.

Sure Bet,"650ml bottle, purchased fresh, poured into a Pipeworks Ninja teku glass. Enjoyed on 8.3.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal.  The beer pours a copper color, displays chill haze with some orange hues and a foamy white head that has great retention and lace. The aroma is very good, tons of tropical fruits, loads of mango puree, citrus, pineapple, nicely floral with a strong malt backbone, sweet and bready with lightly warm alcohol. The flavors are nice, juicy mango, lots of fruitiness with a lightly piney and resinous counterbalance, moderate bitterness with strong sweet pale grains and warm alcohol. The mouthfeel is good, coating, medium body that is creamy and smooth with a warm and dry finish.  Verdict: A very good IPA from Pipeworks. Tons of mango, tons of tropical fruits, really bright and refreshing but more malty and sweet than I'd prefer and the warm alcohol is a consistent issue for me with Pipeworks IPAs. Very good beer but not quite rising to the upper echelons of the style.",0.6993981880681771,4.0,0.9841
Beatification,"Look - Poured to almost no head. Looks flat in carbonation. And golden yellow, kinda like - for lack of a better description - urine after taking too many vitamins. Dinged it for that... - 3.75  Smell - SOOOO much better. Certainly doesn't smell like urine. A nice fragrant sour bouquet. Nectarines, grapes, apple cider, some funk. Can't wait to dig in. - 4.5  Taste - T A R T!!! If your looking for a mellow, delicate, balanced sour (Fou Foune), this ain't you beer. It is amazingly tart. Taste follows the nose, but add in oak, hay. - 4.5  Mouthfeel - excellent. Dry, white wine finish. Nicely (surprisingly) carbonated - the most delicate part of this beer. - 4.5  Overall - So glad I traded for this. Not a daily drinker for me, but a nice occasional treat. - 4.5",0.6811457943487385,4.5,0.9841
Society & Solitude #4,"On draft last night at Brouwerij Lane.  Beautiful golden pour with tons of white head. Plenty of lace adorns my glass. Strong aroma of fresh hops, grapefruit, mangos, citrus, sweet malt, and more piney hops. Love it!  Strongly hopped, yet the ominous malt backbone provides balance. Fruity and delicious up front with piney hops playing rhythm guitar. Perfectly carbonated, and honestly just sublime.  HF comes through again with another world-class DIPA!",0.6962908668360508,4.5,0.9841
Enjoy By IPA,"12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter.   Look: A light amber color with very little head. Typical for the style.  Smell: Holy dank! This beer smells as piney as a Christmas tree. Picking up a ton of tropical fruit; papayas, mangos, pineapple maybe some stone fruits and a ton of grapefruit. Smells great!  Taste: Amazing. Super piney and fruity! Getting a slightly floral note that isn't as pronounced as the tropical fruits. Delicious!  Feel: Feels pretty typical of a double IPA; slightly chewy and very mouth coating. Drinks really smooth for the relatively high ABV.   Overall: Stone really hit a home run with this beer! With a little more refining, this beer could compete with the likes of Pliny and Heady Topper. An amazing feat for a large brewery. Glad this beer is widely distributed and not entirely expensive.",0.6661071932010404,4.5,0.9841
Chocolate Rain,"Was a bit concerned given the chocolate content, but was pleasantly surprised. Noticeable chocolate on the nose, but on the palate it seemed to meld together almost perfectly. Rich and full-bodied, with a pleasant creaminess. Coffee, black fruit notes, chocolate (duh!). The alcohol is noticeable, but considering it is 18% it is surprisingly contained. Really good stuff!",0.7029974853250284,4.5,0.9841
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"I was sure to get my sample of this at Dark Lord Day 2010 and thoroughly enjoyed it. Review is from notes taken on 4/24/2010 and poured from the tap to a plastic cup (blasphemy, I know, but it's what they were offering).  Appearance: Comes to me very black and viscous looking (I should note that it's not nearly as thick as the '08 DL that I was able to sample - didn't get to review though as my pour was not quite deep enough to get everything out of it); has about a 1/4 finger of deep dark brown head that fades quickly to nothing other than a thin ring around the surface of the same color; the body is, of course, entirely opaque (I think this actually feeding off of any light around it) and it leaves behind no lacing.   Smell: About what I would expect, actually, and it's awesome. Tons of smoke, wood (with a bit of a sweet vanilla aspect to it from the barrel aging); big alcohol that is a little bourbonesque in nature; lots of dark, burnt and roasty malts and bit of a deep and dark, ripe fruity (cherry?) aspect hiding out in there.  Taste: Pretty much matches the nose to a ""T."" Lots of that smokey and woody aspect and followed with a hint of sweet vanilla; that big alcohol is definitely present and it's quite hot (I have no idea what year this was made, but if I had to guess I would say it's relatively fresh); again those nice dark, burnt and roasty malts provide tons of flavor and that cherry-like flavor hiding out continues to do so and makes the occasional appearance between the other, more dominant flavors.  Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy, with tons of thick sticky coating holding all over the mouth that allows the nice roasty and bitter flavors to linger for what seems an eternity. In the end, it's a tad gritty, but I like that in a stout, and one of this magnitude certainly does not disappoint.  Drinkability: The flavors and smells alone are enough to keep this high, despite the very present ABV. Also, the mystique and rarity of this beer alone would perhaps keep me coming back for more if it was something that was actually more available. I'm pleased that I got to try it though.",0.6721440278081955,4.0,0.9841
Sip Of Sunshine,"Canned 9 days ago, poured into a Berkompas Tavern shaker glass. Finally available (in very limited quantities) in Massachusetts, I was tickled to get some. 4/16oz/ $15. Not cheap! But one of the finest ales I've tasted. The canned goods I understand are gypsy-brewed at Two Roads in Connecticut. Says so on the can. HVS like honesty.  The brew is copper colored, a tad cloudy but clear compared to Trillium, Hill Farmstead, Heady, etc. The aroma hit me as I poured can to glass. Knew then this was gonna be good. AND IT IS. Fantastic beer in every way. The flavor profile is common to what they're now calling New England IPAs. I'd been calling them Vermont-style, but close enough. If you like this style, you'll love SOS.",0.5705472413266868,4.75,0.9841
Second Fiddle,"Draught pour at Pastoral.  Nice, dry, bitter, piney, resiney, citrusy, not sure how anyone could describe it as following the newer hazy/juicy NEIPA style, this tastes like solid West Coast crushable DIPA. For my palate and preferences I definitely enjoyed it, but not quite as much as SoS.  Updated, original BA score = 4.43, new serving can dated 08/01/18 into a tulip  Definitely so much great piney, resiney, dankness. Left original rating unchanged, felt the draught pour I had previously represented this beer tremendously accurate. Great stuff (if you like traditional West Coast IPAs).",0.6498478437332948,4.5,0.984
Peche 'n Brett,"2014 Vintage. So happy I snagged a bottle of this...apparently only a few cases made it to the central valley this year. Pours a hazy golden color with a large white head that goes down fairly quickly. Scent is AMAZING! Packed with wild yeast and peaches. Especially as this beer warms, the peach aroma builds up and the brett comes out beautifully. Taste is a little more tart than the aroma would imply...which is never a bad thing. Peach skin and funky farmhouse flavors up front. Slightly tart peach flavors with great farmhouse flavors and barnyard hay. This beer is not spicy at all... straight up fruit, barnyard, and funk. So damn tasty. The peach comes out more and more with each sip. Mouthfeel is a bit dry and full-bodied. Drinkability is very high, as the ABV is well-hidden. This 10% farmhouse ale is not boozy in the slightest bit. Overall, Logsdon never seems to disappoint, especially with this one. Such an amazing farmhouse ale. The peaches shine brilliantly in this one. Believe the hype.",0.6791374287212525,4.5,0.984
Sang Noir,"Bottle shared thanks to Darrell (durwoodx), thanks for sharing! 2011 vintage.  The look is nice, it has a deep crimson look to it, very small ring of white head. Inviting look.   Smell is good, but not great to me. I get the cherries, a bit of oak, and then a hefty amount of funky cheese. For me it really has a ton of blue cheese/Camembert cheese to me, doesn't pop with lambic or wild smells but not bad.  The taste has a huge rush of sour cherry and vanilla/chocolate swirl ice cream, huge vinegar rush a t the back of the flavor that opens to a sweet corn type flavor. A ni mid flavor spiciness evolves with each sip which is nice, the flavor doesn't linger other than a vinegar type tartness that is palate numbing in some ways, feel is carbonated and decently bodied, I dig it.   This beer is good, had next to other beers in the style and it was better in many ways. Nice.",0.645020342539129,4.5,0.984
Sip Of Sunshine,"I am an IPA troller. I just stop in at a beer retailer on my way home and see what they have. For me IPAs are like crack. Once you start you can't stop. I was just about to check out with some 90 Minute when the guy in front of me has this 4 pack of pint yellow cans. I had not seen it on the shelf but I was mesmerized. ""What is that?"" I asked. He said get some because it's hard to find. I ran back to the case and found it. There was no price so I was a bit concerned but you know how it is to be on a quest for the best IPA. I said f$%^ it and took a chance. I was unaware of the brewer but now I know. It was the cousin of Heady Topper. I am from CT and I have been to Vermont and know how hard Heady is to get. SOS is very good but I think our group gets a bit star struck with the celebrity brewers. Because of my lack of education in the nuances of the flavors of IPAs I am always skeptical of the reviews. Sip Of Sunshine is very good and I am glad I had the opportunity to try it. I may even get it again if I have a chance but at $15 for a 4 pack even when it is this good is a bit excessive. I would love to try it on draft. Maybe its time to get back to Vermont.",0.503190830665254,4.25,0.984

Scaled Up,"Drank from a 25.4 fl oz (750 ml) bottle purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA 12/17/15 Served in a snifter  Hazy golden amber appearance. Slightly short of cloudy. The liquid was topped by a fluffy, finger tall crown of white froth that quickly fell to a thin film of bubbles. Streaks of drippy lacing trickled along the glass.  The aroma was initially pure orange juice. Candied orange peel later came through as well. Super fruity. Fairly sweet. The complexities grew with time. Tropical fruit notes came forth. Lots of musty passionfruit. Mango was noticeable. Hint of guava. There was a dank, weed-like quality. Super fragrant.  The flavor profile was also amazingly hoppy and fruity but a bit more simplistic than the nose. Orange juice notes dominated. Loads of tangerine as well. Super peachy. Fairly sweet up front. Good dose of candied orange peel. Sweetened grapefruit appeared on the back end and in the finish. Bit of pineyness. Mango was noticeable as the beer warmed. Quite sweet overall but really smooth and quaffable.  The mouthfeel was creamy, slick and smooth. Medium-light for the style. The liquid contained a fine, zippy effervescence. Frothy and fluffy on the palate.  While Scaled Up may not be Trillium's best double IPA, it is incredibly enjoyable and dangerously drinkable. With a bit less sweetness and more complexity in the flavor profile, this could be spectacular.",0.7079665519252731,4.5,0.984
Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,"Appearance - Pour crystal clear amber color with huge fluffy white head that will not go away. Lots of spotty lacing around the glass.  Aroma - huge orange and grapefruit with a hint of sweet tangerine. Nice hop resin mixed with citrus peel. No sign of the 9%.  Taste - Wow taste is big orange, tangerine and grapefruit with bitter citrus peel and hops. The alcohol comes out a little more than in the nose but does not hurt it.  Feel - medium bodied well carbonated a little heat from the alcohol and a slightly dry bitter finish.  Overall - Not much I would change about this one, great flavors wonderful aroma super easy drinking for the 9%.",0.6675609825468982,4.5,0.984
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Popped and shared amongst friends.   2011 Sticker, poured into a wine stem glass.  Beautiful fresh raspberry smell accompanies a light bodied raspberry colored beer with a 1/4 inch white foam head that recedes back into the glass.  Classic Cantillon funk on the back end of the nose and as it warms a bit.  Taste follows the nose here with tart raspberries that have a very natural taste. Freshly squeezed and pressed raspberries with a tart dry finish.  Mouthfeel is light and perfect for the style.  This is easier to obtain than other top tier Frams, or Black Raz, Rasp, blackberry wilds/gueuzes/sours.  It holds up with the best of them. Seek this one out with confidence",0.6540392507426684,4.75,0.984
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"750ml bottle poured into a snifter. Opened to celebrate the birth of my 3rd child, It's a Boy! Major thanks to Phelps for this in the Tickers BIF.  A: Beautiful reddish pink color, with a nice ruby glow when held to the light. About a half finger of white head with a touch of pink tint. Good retention and beautiful lacing.  S: Big funky, tart, sour cherries. Light traces of oak in the background. Nothing complex but smells awesome.  T: Sweet cherries upfront immediately taken over by tartness. Light funkiness and sourness comes through in the middle. Cherries consuming the finish and aftertaste. Super tasty.  M: Light body. Medium high carbonation. Puckering is pretty big until you adjust. Mouth continues to water for a while after each drink.  O: One of the top sours I've had. Just a tasty drinkable brew.",0.6604530549057877,4.5,0.9839
Madagascar,"On tap at EBF in Boston, MA.  This one pours a fairly dark black, with no real head or lacing, maybe a few spots here and there.  Smells so richly, strongly, and wonderfully of vanilla beans, there's a ton here, clearly. I also get chocolate and bourbon tones pretty strongly.  I think this one possibly beats out Vanilla Rye. It's got a less syrupy, molasses-like flavor, and more just pure vanilla and barrel character. There's some oak, chocolate, and bourbon, but the main story is all about the vanilla. Delicious.  This is thick bodied, but not syrupy in the mouthfeel, luckily. There's a lower level of carbonation, and a really nice drinkability.  This was definitely one of the stars of the weekend, super tasty.",0.6730401675017534,4.75,0.9839
Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,"Slap a Toppling Goliath label on this and all of a sudden it would be a perfect 5 haha.   Seriously though, this is perfection at its most subtle. This beer is the perfect rendition of what a regular non adjunct beer should be. This is a true must for a REAL beer appreciation fan who doesn't need fancy pastry gimmicks to make an amazing brew. Great job",0.5921642695589523,4.75,0.9839
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Another fine brew from Cantillon. Vintage 2006 bottle poured into my Cantillon wine glass.  Deep, clear red raspberry color. A slight cap of light pink, tiny bubbles at the top. Pretty much what I expected.  Aroma is filled with raspberries, raspberries, raspberries everywhere. Also backed up with musty basement and slight funk aromas. This one is going to be sooour.  Sweet raspberry opening, but quickly plunges into sour, sour, sour raspberry and raspberry seeds. This beer is exceedingly seedy. Very interesting. Acidic. One of the sourest beers I've ever had. Not particularly complex, but I didn't necessarily expect it to be, and I love what the beer is presenting.  Mouthfeel is perfect. Light-medium bodied, super-dry finish, good carbonation.  Drinkability suffers only because it's so completely, intensely sour. I still polished off half a bottle without a problem, but this will wreck your palate.   Great beer. Recommended for any fan of lambic.",0.6866884715450658,4.0,0.9839
Fort Point Pale Ale,"Pours a murky orange that glows like a Dragonball when held up to the light. Snow-white foam tops out at just over a finger after a modest pour, and retains well. Aroma is orange, tangerine, papaya, and pineapple form a smashing, but not brutal or harsh, tropical fruit display. It smells a little sweet. Toasty biscuit, wheat, and bread malt notes help bring down the sugary citrus rush. Flavor profile is papaya, tangerine, orange, and mango with a hit of toasty biscuit, and bready malt notes. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a fuzzy, nearing-on-velvety texture at the onset and then thins out on the tongue. It has a middle of the road consistency. Overall, a flavorful American Pale Ale, although it really drinks like any other NE IPA just with a little more malt at the forefront. Knocked down 1/4 of a point for that. The malt balance here helps counteract the sugary hop pull most NE IPAs carry, landing this one at a very favorable balance.  Served in a 12oz snifter from a 16oz can.",0.6842599579284033,4.25,0.9839
Sip Of Sunshine,"Canned 1/23, poured into my DFH spiegelbrau...  She is a thing of beauty. Pours a glowing, cloudy honey gold. 1 finger of white foam.  Nose is delightful. I have a 2/7 can that I will plan to compare this to SOON, but getting strong floral / citrus notes from the opening pour. My nose is hovering over the top of the glass, and my wife is asking what I am ""sniffing in the kitchen""...  Taste mirrors the nose. Juicy and slick. it is awesome. Which mean it was probably more awesome a couple of weeks ago. Which means I will need to be more aggressive in terms of getting to that 2/7 can.  Feel is crazy light for 8%. It isn't too bitter, it isn't too sweet, it isn't to thin. I keep finishing my pulls off with a look of nodding approval towards the glass.  Overall, it is the best month old beer I have ever consumed. Really (REALLY) looking forward to getting to the fresher ones in the fridge!",0.5973677707759018,4.5,0.9839
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"2016 variant (bottle number unknown) drank in a snifter on 12/16/2016  L-thick, black, motor oil, nice lacing, minimal head...one of the thickest beers I have had  S/T-wow this is amazing. the barrel alone without adjuncts is unbelieveable. The bourbon, VANILLA-y oak, and barrel come through exceptionally well  F-thick, oily, amazing  Overall-I am amazing at how different these BA DLs are compared to the base. The barreling is outstanding at Floyd's and maybe even underrated (if possible) based on how the gen pop seems to feel about the base DL (which I still enjoy).

Todd The Axe Man,"Pours a slightly hazy dark orange. Not pulpy, but it just looks juicy. Head production is strong, and retention is very good.  The nose is an excellent presentation of the hops: green and leafy, slightly vegetal, herbal, and dank, laced throughout with juicy tones of mango, pineapple, orange, grapefruit peel, and flowers. Touches of pepper and oregano. Slight caramel to go along with honeyed biscuit from the malt.  Flavor follows: immediately dank, with juicy and herbal notes following close behind. Juicy hop notes start with orange, before ranging to mango, pineapple, berries, and start fruit. Some chewy malt emerges mid-palate with grainy pale, caramel, and honey tones. Pungent dank tones return in the second half, growing to a peak just shy of overwhelming the brew. It's a classic Mosaic/Citra brew, and the hops really shine.  Very clean and lively on the palate. Semi-dry on the finish, but the hop oils linger for quite a while. Brings the big flavor and feel of a DIPA in a single IPA ABV package.  An excellent brew!",0.7010585583069625,4.5,0.9839
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Vintage 2009; bottled fall 2011  A - Pours a beautiful clear ruby red with one finger of pink foam. Head quickly settles to a thin cap which is maintained. No lacing.  S - Letting the glass sit for a short time, the aroma is a huge rush of raspberries, both tart and jammy. After swirling the glass a few times, more of the funky side emerges, though the aroma is still dominated by fruit.  T - Nice combination of dry, tart raspberry and moderate funk. Raspberry component has absolutely no sweet jam taste, just a nice solid tartness, but not exceptionally sour, which is to be expected for a younger bottle. Funk plays a supporting role here. I think the aroma was a bit better than the taste, but the taste is still very good.  M - Light, crisp mouthfeel with a tart dry finish.  O - Excellent framboise. Would like to try an aged bottle to see where the tartness and funk end up.",0.6940973078660709,4.5,0.9838
Thicket,"Poured into a Side Project stem from a 375ml bottle. Purchased at release.  Pours a dark purple and burgundy with a nice slightly lilac head that is about 1 inch and quite active. Very lively head that recedes quickly down to a thin ring.  Aroma is wonderufll. Fruit juice, berry and jammy. Then tartness and lactic acid notes that aren't too intense or overwhelming. Notes of wood are present as well. Nice woody earthy notes. Slight funk.  Flavor is wonderful. Berry jam, notes of acidic fruit juice and berry seeds. Earthy berry skin. Amazing sour notes that are nicely tempered by a more chalky yet backbone. Nice notes of earthy wood. Slight funk. One of my favorite fruit sours from SP. Well done.",0.671492334884327,5.0,0.9838
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Picked up a 2014 bottle in the Brewery on the day of the release. Gold wax covers the cap down to the bottom of the neck of the bottle. Poured into a snifter.  A: Thick, viscous, motor oil appearance. Little to no head, what was there dissipated and just remained at the edge of the glass.  S: This was hands down the best beer I've ever smelled. Bourbon, maple, coffee, Carmel, sweet smells. If there was an air freshener of this I would buy them all....every last one.  Taste: Just as good as the smell. Bourbon, coffee, maple syrup, chocolate, vanilla, hint of toffee. All of the tastes I just mentioned seem to be equally dispersed in the beer no real dominate taste, a perfect mix. There was a slight warm alcohol presence when I first sipped but as it warmed it completely disappeared.   M: Thick, rich, filling. Coats your mouth hole and sticks to it. Absolutely wonderful. One bottle is like a meal, but you just want to go back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.  Overall: Think of KBS on steroids with the addition of maple syrup and you have KBBS. Does it meet the hype? In my mind yes. Absolutely wonderful beer that I cannot find flaws with. I was discerning during drinking and tried to find issue with it. I take that back, there was an air bubble between the label and the bottle, I squeezed it out...flawless.",0.6225994649752461,4.25,0.9838
Sip Of Sunshine,"Big thanks to my buddy Robo for this one.  There's a soft hop derived haze to its golden amber body. Two fingers of paper white head shows off some serious stick.   It's like a peach and mango creamsicle in a glass. Ripe and sweet tropical fruits are bold but also very soft and rounded. There's a fluffy vanilla edge to it as well. Its creamy texture actually comes through on the nose. It's not all gooshy and round, however. Juicy fruit and pineapple give it a lively tang.   Mango and papaya come in layers of fleshy, ripe, tropical goodness. The middle is plus sized and peachy. Juicy fruit maintains its tang and transitions well into a fresh, resin forward, piney backing. An outline of biscuit is all that comes from its malt bill. Its perceived bitterness is exceptionally balanced and rounded.  The texture is nothing short of lovely. Creamy and clean. Dry on its edges with a perfectly rendered level of bitterness. The 8% ABV hides in the shadows of the melange of ripe tropical fruit.  Thank god for the Vermont style IPA. Bold, bright, in your face fresh with tropical fruit and a bitterness that cleans and balances instead of defines and lingers. I can't ask for anything more.",0.7181272635404451,4.5,0.9838
Nelson,"22 oz bottle, stamped best by June 2016, poured into IPA glass.  A: Beautiful golden color, pours clear but carbonation is so widespread and steady that it looks hazier in the glass than it actually is. Three-fingered head settles into a finger of pillowy foam, eventually subsides to about an 1/8"" spread uniformly on top.  S: Passion/tropical fruit, white wine, bit of pine sap  T: Strong pine flavors, wine-like tartness, and then strong, sharp rye maltiness. Long, enjoyable finish.   M: Super silky body with plenty of carbonation.  O: Amazing. Wish I had bought more of this!",0.6693031051295834,4.75,0.9838
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Had this yesterday at Dark Lord Day '09. It was so nice to be able to get a glass of Oak Aged Dark Lord and Vanilla Bean Dark Lord, plop down on a couch and compare/review them. Great job by FFF this year. Drank from a classy plastic cup.  Appearance- Pours a jet black with a sort of soft, creamy dark tan head that sticks around for quite some time. A weak cap and thick collar remain the rest of the beer leaving a light bit of lacing (copied from the Vanilla Bean Dark Lord, they were exactly the same). Smell- Loads of deeply roasted malts, a bit of sweet molasses and some very woody oak. The smell isn't necessarily harsh but the oak is fairly pungent. Some vanilla and milk chocolate along with some licorice and a touch of smoke. Some dark fruits as well but the oak really is fairly dominant. Taste- I don't necessarily think that the barrel aging really helps Dark Lord (unlike the Vanilla Bean). I find it to be semi astringent with almost too much barrel. Plenty of vanilla still though and a bit of bitter roasted coffee. The sweetness seems to be quite a bit more advanced that the regular Dark Lord as well. Tons of bourbon soaked cherries, prunes, dates, figs and any other overly ripe dark fruit you can think of. Finishes with a touch of smoke and a bit of boozy oaky bourbon like quality. Mouthfeel- Big and rich and creamy with a smooth silkiness and a bit of boozy astringency. Drinkability- Uhh... Out of the three Dark Lords this one was by far my least favorite. Just not a big fan of the barrel aging which is weird because I usually enjoy the added complexity. Maybe I was just a bit spoiled by the Vanilla Bean? Either way glad I got to try it.",0.6489560146689017,3.5,0.9838
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"16 oz can dated 12/1. A little older than I would like, but when someone gives you a Trillium, you shut up and drink it. Poured into Belgian ale glass.  L: 2F+ head with good retention, leaves lots of foamy lacing and a cap and ring. Beer is a nice New England hazy pale bronze/orange.  S: Nose suggests it's none worse for the wear. Lots of nice citrus including grapefruit, orange, and lime, ripe and juicy. A promise of slight dankness and earthiness. Very nice.  T: Lots of grapefruit and lime. Slightly sour, as if the malts never quite come forward. A little bit of earthiness on the finish, but it's mostly an El Dorado citrus show.  F: Light to medium body. Light to medium carbonation. Good drying and balance. Very good construction.  O: A little bit of dead yeast/debris at the bottom of the glass. It happens. Another Trillium winner overall and I'm sure 4 weeks ago it was a little bit better.",0.6463603370471301,4.25,0.9837

Haze,"With the balance of pale ale but with the complexity, intensity and strength of imperial ale, Tree House brewers push the limits on hop aroma and flavor while keeping the bitter-to-sweet ratio a little closer to even-keel.  Once again, the New England-style IPA rears its ugly head with the murk of a mud puddle and looks like the tarnish gold of vegemite. A plethora of citrus, tropical and orchard fruits churn from the dense ecru froth and entice the nose with promises of fruit, tartness and bittersweetness. Honey, caramel and crusty key-lime pie come to mind as the ale creeps onto the tongue.  Its bright fruit bouquet transitions to taste immediately with red grapefruit, tangerine, nectarine, pineapple, mango, passionfruit, lime, lemon and kiwi. Canteloupe and a berry-like tang rounds out the fruitiness of the esters and hops while the persestent sweetness within coats the middle palate with layers of fructose, angel-food cake and succulent honey. As the ale turns to take a bitter stride, the taste of fresh shavings of pine and sassafras weave in to command the sweetness with a fresh grassiness, herbal dankness and a curious taste of cannabis.  Medium-full in body, the beer's imperial heft keeps the ale richer and fuller, and resists any convincing turn to dryness, bitterness or elevated crispness. What the palate gets in return is the full malt balance that gives the hops a more rounded and more complex flavor. An aftertow of herb and citrus have a warm alcohol spice counterpart in a long cream-sickle finish.",0.6904016050552059,4.5,0.9836
Enjoy By IPA,"Enjoy by July 25. Wonderful Double IPA. enjoyed on the porch in July on a beautiful summer day, certainly that helps. Great color and aroma from the pint glass we drank from. Nice citrusy taste and great mouth feel. Was unable to get the 12/25/16 version though tried. Keep 'em coming.",0.5885560650876954,4.5,0.9836
Green,"Damn, this beer is really amazing! It pours a merky hazy golden orange. The the fruity delicious smell hits you. Orange, mango, pineapple, it's all there! How can you not love Tree House beers and the hopppy goodness that they portray?! The first sip will knock your socks off! Pure juicy and delicious! Each mouthful gets better and better especially as the beer warms up. Have to say this is one of my favorite beers that I have ever had!! Every mouthful is so enjoyable! Never gets old. Do yourself a favor and take the trip to this brewery and get your hands on some of these! Arguably the best beer on the planet!",0.6076674932343206,4.5,0.9836
Sang Noir,"my brother is a deadset champion for sharing this bottle with me. its one of those beers ive been after for years, but my travels or trades havent gotten me there. what a rare treat it is, wine and bourbon sharing the barrel influence of this burgundy sour beer accentuated with tart cherries. i would put this one on par with any of the russian river dark sours, and i think it needs to be mentioned in that breath. its almost purple in color, darkened to a rich ruby wine shade and showing about an inch of really light lace head. cherry is evident from first sip, tart pie style cherries in there mixing with the bacteria cultures and the wine tannins, its a really mouth watering nose. the whiskey part comes more towards the finish in this beer, more hot oak than vanilla, with just enough char to slow it down to be savored. the body isnt real big, but it doesnt need to be, the flavor complexities ride and appear one by one on the sour waves, which are dominated by lacto, but not entirely. some brett in here too i have to imagine, there is some funk in there with the acid. it warms up to show even more wine properties, pinot for sure. its usually tough for me to identify a grape varietal in a beer, especially from a barrel, but i think its unmistakable here. cherries never get sweet, even exacerbating the already extremely sour feel to this. carbonation is mellow, but more isnt wanted for. the process and the execution of this beer are both something to behold, it never shows its alcohol strength, and at room temperature sips like a fine glass of port or something. cant say enough about this one, a crown jewel in the increasingly crowded fruited sour world.",0.6566069643193266,4.5,0.9836
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Vertical drank for Sean and Caroline's engagement party, quite a shame other Chicago Ba's couldn't make it for this one, great times. This is the type of beer that just screams to have separate vintage listings as there was such variation. Instead of reviewing each one, this will more be a guide for those interested in the different vintages. 2002 Vintage 750 ml bottle - one of the top 3 vintages of the night. Awesome aroma that was funky but not harsh, wonderful dusty farmyard notes. The taste was just special because it was biting, dusty, floral and sour, yet it wasn't Cantillon sour in that I could drink this all night long. A vintage worth trying. 2003 Vintage 375 ml bottle - This was pretty decent, in the middle of the variations. Was drank simultaneously with an 03 Drie Oude Gueuze and the Vintage destroyed it. Not even in the same galaxy. 2004 Vintage 375 ml bottle - Nothing really stood out here, still good but towards the bottom. 2005 Vintage 375 ml bottle - Somehow this vintage has two bottle dates, a shocking 10 months apart, February 2005 and December 2005. The older one was much better and was in the top 3. 2006 Vintage 750 ml bottle - Hands down the worst of the bunch, I'm almost positive this had to be a bad bottle. This was totally malty, tons of caramel and dough with hops, was like a gueuze barleywine. Terrible, I would not drink this again. 2007 Vintage 750 ml bottle - Valentines dating. To me this was the best of the bunch, a little more sour and acidic which I like in my gueuze. Very musky, just wonderful overall. I picked this up at Drie, super happy I have one left.  Thanks to Alex and Sean for contributing to this.",0.5697147533091337,4.5,0.9835
Sure Bet,"This beer looks incredible and smells even better. Nice bright yellow with great lacing. So much mango, sweet honey, and tropical notes of pineapple and other fruits. Taste definitely comes through on the honey with the mango taking the back seat. As an imperial IPA, this is super well-balanced with the sweet masking the bitterness of the hops. Definitely one of Pipeworks best.",0.6478975450372181,4.75,0.9835
Haze,"S: Apricots. Peaches. Mango. Pineapple. Grapefruit. Orange juice. Grass. Earthy spice. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ T: Sweet oranges. Grapefruit. Peach. Apricots. Papaya. Pine. Spice. Bready malt. Earthy. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ M: Similar mouthfeel and purée-ish body as seen with Green, but with a lot more gusto. Sticky. Tongue-tickling carbonation. Slight booze burn. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ O: An outstanding brew by its merits, but my weak little Asian stomach can't seem to stomach the magnitude of this brew. I'll perhaps one day (if there ever comes a day when I have the chance to drink this more frequently) grow into this super thick super juicy super saturated haze fad, but as for now this is just too much for me to handle.",0.3995668865370052,4.5,0.9835
Beatification,"I have been getting really into sours the past few years. It's an exciting time to be doing so since there are more and more options popping up and many of them are truly delicious. Beatification is among the very best I have had. It definitely is one of the most intense sours out there. Although the flavor is extreme, this is incredibly well balanced and pleasurable to drink. A true delight.",0.6568714099887951,4.5,0.9835
Nelson,"Bottle (Green Flash emblem is clearly shown) into a Belgain Tulip.  For starters I've never had Alpine beers from the Source. I have only had versions of the Green Flash era Alpine brews. Yet this one is speaking to me. This brew pours nearly perfect IPA SRM, you know what I mean!? Sunset Amber with an opaque texture, clearly it's unfiltered (which makes me like her already, she's a dirty girl with dirty intentions). Nice cloud white foam crowns this beaut...she's gonna give plenty of lace!   Next step in the enjoyment of the brew, the aroma. She smacking some veins with that fruity vibe and dank hop resins. It's a mixture of white grape skins and a bit of that marijuana earthiness. The ""dank"" is kind of aggressive with its touch. Backend has some berry notes and a touch of dried apricots. This is pretty banging.   Da Flavah? First hits with that rye sweetness that, in turn, slaps some spiciness to the tongue...I like what she is Sayin now! Second wave is Hoppy Goodness nice and green. The flavors of the oils explore the senses. This grabs that Hop Resin vibe with some fruity undertones. Nice Passion Fruit , and Grapefruit stand out the most. Then the Resin comes back for thirds and isn't slacking either. In the distant backend there's notes of Dill...weird. This finishes on time with a smooth dryness and a balanced spicy/bitterness. Aftertaste of Grapefruit pith and Hop Resin. This brew feels amazing on the palate. Nice medium smooth body and tight but not aggressive carbonation helps the flavors to pop on the palate.   Overall: I don't care who did what here, this brew is Outstanding! No wonder the high acclaim it's a well brewed IPA that captures the Hop in a drinkable fashion. The malts are there and add body and enough sweetness to carry the oils in a superb fashion. I see this being a repeat purchase. This brew is Recommended.",0.6911357189021098,4.5,0.9835
Green,"Pours a very hazy muddled orange color. The orange is quite bright and almost glows in the light. Thin off white head dissipates quickly leaving plenty of white lacing and some spotty residual head.   Smell has notes of orange, tangerine, mango, pineapple and some grass. Nice fruity aroma, but there is clearly some bitter hop notes on the nose in the grass notes.   Taste follows the nose with lots of tropical fruit - mango, pineapple, orange, and a bit of white grape - giving way to a nice orange rind bitterness mixed with some grassy notes. Definite bitterness with this one - its not straight fruit juice.   Feel is very full bodied and super smooth. Almost creamy mouthfeel.   Overall a really well crafted outstanding brew. Im not sure I think it warrants a perfect BA score, but its still an outstanding beer.",0.6862580604382561,4.5,0.9835
Coconut B-Bomb,"This one pours a very dark brown, basically black, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.  This smells like charred oak, smoke, rich toasted coconut, leathery and boozy bourbon, chocolate, coffee, and spiced bread.  This is an excellent entry into this series. Coconut goes so well with this, as the barrel already gives off a slight vanilla and coconut flavor. There's lots of charred and toasted oak, and a big bourbon blast that comes across as boozy, but not overwhelmingly so. The base has a great dark bitter chocolate character, as well as a spicy bready malt flavor that's just so tasty.  This is medium bodied, creamy and nicely rich, with a normal level of carbonation.  Fremont makes barrel-aged beers that hit everything I want. There's lots of complexity, they are not too sweet, and they are well balanced. This is excellent stuff.",0.6867040075487268,4.75,0.9835
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"I wrote up a big story for this one, but is was just strange and a little creepy and so I decided just to post the drunken notes I took at DLD. I got inside maybe 20 minutes after they tapped this, while they were still serving it in glass glasses.  Nice pour, although the head isn't as retentive as I live in a perfect impy. Real dark black, no red at all.  Smells like bourbon barrells, pornographic malts, roasted nuts, wood, alcohol, fire yeast, fruity oak.  Tastes much less complex than it smells. Big fiery bourbon outweighs most everything else, leading into a middle of fire burnt dark malt and a very rough and dry finish. Fantastic, but not perfect.   I'd say that regular DL is probably my 3rd favorite beer and well deserving of a perfect five. But I am keeping the bottles I bought at this year's DLD for at least a few more months before I try drinking them. They're just too powerful right now, and not as many of the complexities shine through. Add barrel aging to the mix, and you get a fantastic beer that's just too much to judge.",0.6239822763455474,4.0,0.9834
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"Pours deep black with no head and minimal lacing.  Aroma is oak, bourbon but don’t get the maple I expected.   Taste is very solid and I do get maple in the aftertaste that lingers. I will say the alcohol is very well hidden.   While I enjoyed this beer, mouthfeel did not live up to the rest of this beer.   Overall this is very solid beer from Jackie o’s. I loved the lingering maple on the back end of the sip. Barrel comes in nicely and easy drinking for an 11.0 percent beer. Mouthfeel holds this beer back. That being said, a very good beer",0.6298062033820305,4.5,0.9834
Peche 'n Brett,"L -- Pours an ever-so-slightly hazy straw body with practically no head produced with even a well aerated pour. Looks like cider  S -- Peach, jasmine, green apple jolly rancher, watermelon, bretty sourness, dryer sheets. Aromas don't pop out of the glass but are very nuanced and pleasant  T -- The peach really shines here and offsets the moderate (definitely not overbearing) tartness that is present. Also getting raspberry, oaky tannins, musky perfume, floral, quince, sour apple  F -- Medium- mouthfeel, medium carb. Nice and lively, an excellent warm weather beer. No bitterness and the 10% ABV is absolutely undetectable. Someone could tell me this is 5% -- hell, even 3.5% -- and I'd believe them.  O -- One of the best wild saisons I've had to date. The peach addition really brings everything together nicely. Wish it weren't $20/750ml, but it's worth it for special occasions.   91/100",0.6814702122285412,4.5,0.9834
Juicy,"consumed fresh - bottled 12.2016  love the appearance of this bottle - pour is a slightly hazy golden orange color with a bright white head that decorates the glass.   strong aromas of funky brett, lemongrass, hay, barnyard, horse blanket, citrus peel, slightly tart, touch of peppery spice, garlic, apples, hint of oak.   palate is tart apples, orange peel, lemon, beautiful funkyness, vinous notes, garlic, onion, peppery hops, oak, crackery malt  mouthfeel is crisp and this beer finishes slightly dry, light-medium bodied with a fluffy & creamy texture that accentuates the beautiful flavor profile.   overall this beer was refreshingly tart and extremely enjoyable and while this is not my go to style, its easily a standout in my mind... absolutely perfect!",0.7023295790824367,4.75,0.9834
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"big thanks to Kevin for this one  long time want  poured into a perfect stout glass  completely black with a mocha head  coffee is in full force with this one as expected, comes across fantastic. deep roasted coffee, slight vanilla and burbon in the back  big roast and coffee upfront and center and all the way through. vanilla barrel sweetness in the back that cuts the coffee bitterness a little bit but the after test is still a bit bitter. was really hoping for more barrel tho, especially since label says it's been in the barrel for 11 months  feel is nice, thick bodied with a nice amount of carbonation.  overall this is an excellent beer, very well made. coffee comes thru completely. if your a coffee lover this is a must! not the as good as cycle coffees or bcbs but much better than most",0.6283807569579042,4.0,0.9834
Beatification,"d from a 375ml corked and caged bottle into a Spiegelau tulip. Bottled on 1/10/12 printed on label.  Appearance: Pours a light honey gold with a 1-2 finger sudsy snow white head. There is a fair amount of sludgy buildup inside the bottle where the cork came out, but it doesn't seem to pour into the beer. The head dissipates quickly leaving a small ring around the edges before finally disappearing altogether. Little to no lacing once the head dissipates.  Smell: Tart, but not overpoweringly. There is a hint of barnyard funk to go along with apple cider, sweet white wine, lemon, vinegar and a touch of oak. Extremely complex aroma which balances sweetness with tartness.  Taste: Wow, that's one intensely tart array of flavors! Vinegar and wine grape hulls up front followed by sweet cider and touch of funk in the middle before ending with lemon zest and just a faint hint of oak. Aftertaste is bitter, tart and very dry with notes of earthiness, oak tannins and a little funk.  Mouthfeel: Light-to-medium-bodied with an very high amount of prickly carbonation. The mouth is coated by the puckering sourness.  Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. I could drink a lot of this beer if only I were lucky enough to have multiple bottles.  Overall: Excellent beer overall. Russian River really knocked it out of the park with this one. I can't imagine a sour beer getting much better than this. I can't recommend it enough.",0.6685653637544615,4.5,0.9834
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Pours with a large but very quickly dissipating head. Not much lacing. Straw-colored and cloudy.  Aromas of esters very forward and prominent--banana and citrus as expected, and very pleasing. Bubblegum sweetness in the background. Very little if any phenolic spice. Very little yeast. Rather subdued overall, but still a fine aroma.  Tastes much like the aroma in the same order of prominence, with the esters perhaps overpowering the other aspects. Banana and gingerbread flavors immediately come to mind, with a touch of pepper in the aftertaste. Not sickly sweet, but perhaps a bit sweeter than expected.  The mouthfeel is remarkably full-bodied, and even slick, but with a nice crisp finish, doubtless from strong carbonation.  Overall a fine brew that I will likely try again for a re-rate, just in case I got an ""old"" bottle. I like wheat beers, including others by this brewer, but was somewhat disappointed in what others have found to be the ""paragon"" of the style. This one checks all of the boxes for a Hefe, but seemed out of balance, with too much emphasis on the sweetness, and not enough yeast and spice.",0.7145536220319062,4.0,0.9833
Juicy,"Bottled 12/16, poured into my mini snifter, because I enjoy my beer incrementally when it is this good! Pour is like carbonated apple juice, little to no head. Smell is wine and not too funky funk. But funk fo sho. Taste... after hovering over this glass with my nose for a good two minutes... awesome. Big wine, solid funk, and both of those carry through with smooth finish I would name ""RR Supplication light"" (intended as the highest compliment!) Feel is where Juicy really earns it's name. Huge flavor and funkiness present. Really awesome. My first HF offering, and did not disappoint in any way.",0.6296673729677496,4.5,0.9833
Enjoy By IPA,"12 oz bottle that was bottled on 9/24/17 and opened on 11/2/17 poured into a Duvel chalice.  Only a very slight haze happens upon an otherwise bright gold and amber color. A white, rocky topped foam has given decent coverage.   The aromatic density for this IPA is pretty stunning. Deep layers of several different hop effects pop out of the glass, earthy grapefruit, citrus blend, sweet and earthy.... The malt seems pretty hefty with some big honey and caramel aroma's . A hot/dry forest floor aroma is prevalent, dried leaves and maybe some golden wheat as well. There's a lot going on here.  The hop complexity becomes very clear with the first sip, whamo!! A hearty, crisp and earthy hop bite is impressive. Certainly a fresh, crisp and snappy overall feel and body. The sweet malty aroma really becomes much more crisp, light and bright in the flavor. A slightly bitter, metallic herbs and holden grains seem to seemlessly flow around eachother. Big earthy complexity, grainy, dry, citric and leafy come to mind from this combo of hops. The bitterness never gets too much, its in check but still delivers a bite. The 9.4 % abv. Is very well hidden and only adds to the depth and provides a nice warming effect. Earthy and dry citrus is the short version of this hop flavor, which is monsterously complex.  Stone still knows how to deliver the goods. Freeeesh.  Enjoy By 4/20/19!! * Update 12 oz. Can Just a bit late!...4/26/19  Copper gold, only a slight haze. Sticky white foam.  The 10 (10!!) Different hops give off a very stoney aroma. Dense and sweet citrus based tropical hoppy aromatics are deeeep. A caramel and honey tinged amber malt makes for that classic West Coast style balance.  Crisp bite, turns to a slick medium bodied feel, a bit boozy at 9.4 % abv which gets ramped up from the dry hitter side of the hops. With complexity comes a compromise in drinkablity sometimes, especially for the heady Western IPA's.",0.7386120174265259,4.25,0.9833
Todd The Axe Man,"Pours an orange-gold color with a small white head that breaks rather quickly leaving a small island of bubbles in the middle. There is little lacing. Some suspended particulates as well.   Smell is all hops up front with a huge amount of citrus, especially orange or grapefruit pith. Then there comes a nice tropical fruitiness and malt profile and finally it ends with some nice pine.   Taste follows the nose with the pithy flavor first, then some juicy tropicals. The malts come in pretty strong and give a nice secondary sweetness to it as well. Finishes with a bit of pine bitterness.   Feel is medium in weight with a good amount of carbonation. This beer gives the mouth a slight coating making the finish a little bitter which is quite enjoyable.   I got what I expected from this beer. A really nice and easy to drink IPA. I took my time and enjoyed this, knowing it would be a rarity for me to get it again.",0.6769448739321224,4.25,0.9833
Black Tuesday,Wow. Simply an amazing beer.aroma is strong of booze and bourbon. Looks dark as night and black as death. Tastes like sweetness mixed with goodness and love. Heavy on the notes of barrel and vanilla but really couldn't discern much bourbon. Amazing and really unique. This is what world wide stout wishes it was like. Much thanks to steveb24 for sharing,0.6136544662057394,4.75,0.9833
Black Tuesday,"A: Pours a deep brown color, pitch black once it collects in the glass. A slight mocha head forms, but it disappears pretty quickly.   S: A big mix of sweet dark chocolate, raisin and bourbon that meld together really well. For a beer this huge, the alcohol doesn't really scare you off in the smell.  T: This is fantastic. Tons of rich dark chocolate and bourbon notes with a touch of chocolate covered cherry, raisin, port and char. A huge beer, but it's really smooth and there's no real burn at all, which is pretty crazy. Definitely deserving of its reputation.",0.627290536936683,4.5,0.9833
Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Thanks again to Rich for the share, this going side by side with the non-BA version.  This takes everything good in the regular version, but just amps it up even more. The regular was nice, but this was really excellent. Good tart zing from the barrel, complimenting the grass and earth in the base, notes of peppery spice and dried flowers. Very good!",0.6522495005672413,4.5,0.9832

Just a delicious glass of happiness.  Mouthfeel is sharp, drying, slightly chalky and a bit puckery. Very nice, you can certainly tell you are getting a hop forward 8.1% DIPA.

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"On-draught @ One Mile House in Manhattan. 13% ABV (2016 vintage).  Aroma promises a chewy malty stout with leathery bourbon notes, tobacco, caramel, and dark malts. Excellent barrel character. Ideal level of sweetness. Base beer could offer more, but it doesn't get eclipsed. Aromatic intensity is moderate.  Leathery chewy thick texture, with a smooth wet mouthfeel. Plenty of body here, but no overcarbonation.  Bourbon barrel notes slip seamlessly into the malty base beer, evoking leather and tobacco but no overt vanilla/vanillin, coconut, or toasty oak. Malty core offers chocolate malts, caramel, and dark malts. Well balanced and built, even if the dazzling intricacy and nuanced subtlety of the best expressions of the style isn't quite paralleled. Well built fare.  Overall, it's drinkable fare particularly for an imperial stout (let alone a 13% ABV one) and will please fans of regular expedition. The bourbon could be improved as could the beer as a whole, but it's nice stuff as-is. Worth the $1/1oz pricetag, but I wouldn't go out of my way to nab a bottle - astonishingly well-disguised though its high ABV may be.  High B- (3.46) / WORTHY",0.7210103713180233,3.5,0.9832
Juicy,"Bottle opened 6/22/13, poured into a HF taster glass.  A-Upon opening, this one is a bit of a gusher. Nothing bad, but if I hadn't started pouring the beer would have gone all over the table. It pours dark copper verging on red with effervescent carbonation running throughout the beer. It is very cloudy from some yeast sediment that got kicked up from the gushing bottle. A two inch fluffy white head falls a little over the first minute, but remains on top of the beer throughout the entire glass. Some yeast sediment settles at the bottom of the glass.  S- Lactic acidity as well as brett is apparent on the nose. Grapefruit and citrus is also there, although I can't tell if it is from the hops or bugs. There is a very interesting barnyard/musty note as well, most likely from the brett.   T- Up front is some phenolic brett, although right away the flavor is dominated by a grapefruit juice like flavor that immediately dries everything out. There is a tiny bitter note on the end, although with the complexities in this beer, it is easy to miss.   M- It starts out extremely effervescent, with high carbonation, but not over the top. There is medium body that sits right where I want it for a beer like this- not too over the top, but still apparent enough. After you swallow, your mouth is immediately dried out, and without another sip will remain that way for quite a while! This beer encourages you to keep drinking it.   O- Incredibly complex beer from start to finish. I was expecting more hop flavors, but It seemed like the bugs have really taken over on the flavor front of things, making for a very interesting wild ale. The only real fault I see with this beer is that I don't have another to age out and see how it develops over time.",0.6472726942599908,4.75,0.9832

Chocolate Rain,"Bottle into a wine glass.   Burnt umber, milky and opaque in the middle and clearer at the edges. A hard pour results in nearly no head, which is expected -- this thing is like liqueur.   Huge bourbon nose, packed with alcohol. Vanilla bean, buttered toffee, acrid charred oak, and dark chocolate sauce. Lots and lots of chocolate sauce.  Wow, is this rich. Vodka-soaked heath bars, bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, oak. It's a delicious blend, but so sugary I'm worried I'll get a headache.  The word of the day is: rich. Thick, syrupy medium-full body. Alcohol heat is high, like pepper spice on the tongue. It numbs the tongue a little as well. Carbonation is light and prickly. Heavy stuff.   Like drinking chocolate frosting. Thick, rich, highly inebriating. It is, however, a one-trick pony. There's not a ton of complexity, but you don't really need it. Chocolate? Good. Stout? Good. Bourbon? Gooood.",0.6413858591872195,4.0,0.9832
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Picked up a bottle of the 2004 Vintage Gueuze during my last trip to Belgium when weissebierdrinker and I visited the brewery. Cheers man. Best before April 2014.  A - Pours a lovely dark sorta orange colour. Very cloudy with the sediment in there. Good carbonation. A nice 2 finger soapy and creamy head at the same time. Solid one finger head retains with nice staggered rings of lacing.  S - I can smell the strength of it from fairly far away. Funk and wood are there. Citrus and lemon candies. Grape skins.  T - Quite tart, lemon cady, oak/wood, funk. Grass and spiderwebs? It just aches of old creaky barnyards. Grape, lemon, and unripened plums come out. Lovely. Just sweet enough keep from being overpoweringly tart.  M - Strong carbonation and a medium-ish body with a crisp and slightly tart finish.  O/D - Good Gueuze. I can't really tell what the extra age has done but the base Gueuze is great stuff as well. Glad I got to try this rarity, it was worth it.",0.6468356359837923,4.5,0.9832
Green,Pours hazy yellow with nice head. Great looking hazy beer.  Smell is good. Nice and juicy with a mango pineapple sort of nose. But of bitter with some sweet.   The taste is a nice blend of tropical fruit and bitter hops. Seems like both the bitter and the juicey hops compete for the tongue.   It’s a smooth beer up front but as you drink more the bitter starts to win out a bit. Very enjoyable but the balanace starts to tip   Overall a fantastic beer. Has a bunch going on. Very interesting and a great sipper.,0.656511844378085,4.5,0.9832
Nectarine Premiere,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into a oversized wine glass. Thank you Ryan for sharing this!  Pours a sunshine golden hazy body, this is literally glowing. Small white head. Beautiful beer. God damn that is thick on the last pour. Oh my god, straight fruit purée.  On the nose.. straight stone fruit, pulp to the nasal, like someone just crushed a bunch of nectarines and peaches and the aromas are wafting in my general direction.  On the tongue is straigh stone fruit pulp, sour peaches, orange juice and nectarine pulp goodness. Thick and juicy. God damn this is amazing.  One of the best sours I've ever tasted. This was perfect on every account.",0.6013814835799859,4.75,0.9831
Aaron,"Opaque chestnut brown with a moderate fuzzy tan blanket that slowly settles to the thinnest ring and a smooth slick surface. A tilt leaves an impressive span of clear legs on the glass.  The aroma has swirls of vanilla and caramel, even as the glass sits further away. Coming in close, charred oak and aged date pair with toffee and a distinctly maple-esque bourbon warmth.  Taste is just as sweet and decadent as the nose sounds. Belly warming caramel frosting is lifted by Jack and Coke--it sounds odd and maybe off-putting, but it's light on the palate, helping its drinkability. Heavier notes of dark fruit and vanilla marshmallow fluff are again countered by sweet, light and even floral fig, which all begins to transform into fresh coconut on the exhale, especially as it warms.  Tingly and even crisp, the medium body is really easy to drink for a big burly barleywine. It's even inexplicably fleeting, disappearing into a slightly numbing, lightly sticky, semi-dry finish, leaving you desperately craving another swig. Obviously, I like this a lot, but at the same time, feel like I can't quite grasp it. There's something unsatisfying that leaves you wanting, and maybe that's the beauty of it.",0.6804922420617394,4.5,0.9831
Black Tuesday,"Thanks for mlaroche for this bottle.  Review #1000!  Vintage 2010  Pours a wicked dark black color, no light getting through this, not even at the edges, smallish head that fades very quickly and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass.  Huge notes of dark fruit, especially fig and raisin, even has almost a chocolate sherry aroma, subtle hints of wood, bourbon is quite prevalent on the nose as well.  Taste starts out with a bourbon burn, even after almost 4 years of aging this still packs a punch although it's not nearly as bad as when I first tried it a few years ago, quite sticky and sweet although the sugary aspects have also mellowed out and allowed the dark fruit to have a large presence, carbonation is low but more than adequate for this style and is very soft on the mouth, finishes with a very sticky feeling.  To be honest, I didn't care for it the first time. It was way too sugary sweet and burned too much as well. It's still very strong in both of those arenas but have considerably mellowed out and allowed other flavors to come through. Overall, a good choice for my 1000th review as it demonstrates a good usage of cellaring. I think I'll sit on my 2011 bottle until I hit 1100 reviews (at my current pace, it might be awhile).",0.66687883924239,4.5,0.9831
Aaron,"2014 Vintage   Appearance: It has a nice dark murky brown color to it. It has a nice beige head that dies down moderately and leaves next to no lacing.  Smell: Wow! The aromas definitely give out hints of sweet caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, dark fruit (raisins, figs), oak and light bourbon. Speechless.   Taste: Like the aromas, it has loads of sweet caramel, toffee, brown sugar, some molasses, dark fruit, some woody oak and light bourbon.   Mouthfeel: It has a low-med carbonation with a very nice overall balance and feel.   Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied by great flavors and aromas. Hands down the best Barleywine I've had.   Serving type: bottle",0.6691170855999947,5.0,0.9831
Sip Of Sunshine,"Got the word from a friend that the Brattleboro, VT Co-op had this. Sure enough! Opened/sampled and reviewed on 3/23 Canned date on bottom: 3/7/17  Only a very gentle haze and lazy stream of bubbles can be seen through this nearly opaque, burnt golden color with orange highlights liquid. A classic 2"" high, clumpy, sea foam looking cap stands proud. Long lasting retention and constant thin coverage with Obvious sticky lace left after the fall.   A blend of caramel sweet and golden pilsner like malt and tropical fruity notes hits the nose first. An earthy, herbal....gritty scent is obvious, grapefruit, tangy citrus and mellon follow. Besides the big, fruity complexity it is actually very floral, surrounded by a peppery earth aroma. Very nice nose indeed. This has a big, impressive New England style aroma.   The first slow sip delivers a bit of a surprising spice and pepper bite, much more earthy than I had expected. It was the first thing I smelled, and the herbal, earthy hop bite shines through in the flavor as well. A very crispy, gritty-grains malt taste, very ""Farmhouse"" esque with bits of golden wheat and tangy, sour malty effects. The hop complexity is very high, delivering a sharp, earthy-bitter bite that quickly mellows to a blend of tropical>citrus>mellon fruity flavor's that all blend together to make a very unique overall flavor spectrum. Certainly multi layered hop flow of flavor.   Double IPA strength at 8 %abv. Is WAY to easy to sip. No problem sipping fast! Rather grainy and full feelung at first with more of a big juicy feel later on. A tangy, earthy citrus flavor lingers for a bit in the aftertaste.   The high alpha hops are obvious, they pack an excellent, earthy-bitter punch but is also rounded out by an excellent malt balance that grounds the overall flavor very well. This DIPA draws obvious comparisons to some of the very best, big hop brews I've had recently : Heady Topper, The Green and Space Juice. Sick complexity that is easy to drink, is a new level for the DIPA.",0.7372071702583022,4.75,0.9831
Coolship Red,"I'd heard about Cool Ships. My wife, a wine drinker, and I were 1st timers at the brewery on a Friday, just happened to ask the server as I was about to leave if they had any of this CS? He said no but they were releasing some on Sat. 2 per customer @10am. Got my wife out of a warm bed at an ungodly hour to drive 25 miles to get in an already forming line at 8:45. She was ever so happy, NOT, to be my ""mule"" so I could buy 4 not just 2. Drank one after a little chilling at the motel and was not remotely disappointed. I like sours and this was pucker power but in a nice way. A couple are going back to Fl. to share with a friend. Oh, did I say I went back later that day and bought two more! Pricey though for 16oz bottle @$15/per but I guess after a 3 year wait this is ok. Worth the wait. Worth the price. Yea Allagash!",0.44314607090437264,4.5,0.983
Haze,"16oz can (packaged on 3/20/17) poured into belgian tulip glass.  Beautiful medium gold completely hazed body with a thick finger and a half of head with great retention and lacing. This beer really comes through with the sticky delicious citrus and fruity hop aroma followed by amazing pineapple, peach, and orange juice flavors. Mouthfeel is very balanced, carbonation on point and no alcohol to be detected. Every sip of this brew was a delight and I'm so happy to have had the opportunity to try a beer that emulates my favorite juice of all (orange).",0.6668957447782068,5.0,0.983
Society & Solitude #4,"fresh growler drank on 8/25/2016  L-nice clarity, thick white head, nice lacing  S-earthiness really stands out, certainly some unique citrus notes too...some grapefruit, but i get a lot of mango, papaya, orange, and melon too  T-the complexity and balance of the earthiness, pine, citrus really comes through in the taste. All of the same from the smell comes through and comes through exceptionally well  F-creamy, kind of heavy, but so smooth and easy to drink...nice bitter back end too  Overall-one of my favorite of the HF IPAs, probably second or third after Abner and maybe Double Citra. I really enjoyed this. Very unique, especially when considered how the style is changing these days. This is a Classic East Coast IPA and one of the best out there. Thanks Shaun!",0.6931618421355012,4.75,0.9829
Sure Bet,"Many thanks to Blue-dream for the opportunity to try this beauty.  The beer pours a peachy orange color that's a bit on the hazy side. Head retention is quite good, and there is considerable lacing. The nose is impressive as well, and put me immediately in mind of SOS and some of the other Vermont/NE beers I had in the past. There is considerable tropical fruit and citrus in the nose, along with a hint of pine and earthiness. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, with the tropical fruit dominating. The finish is still fairly dry and bitter, and the alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is fairly full for a DIPA, and I found this beer to be insanely easy to drink.  Excellent DIPA. Just wish it were more readily available where I live. :-)",0.6960087216764235,4.25,0.9829
Todd The Axe Man,"Canned on 8/19/19. 16oz can poured into a tulip. Pours a hazy golden, but it's not cloudy or murky; small white head that fades leaving decent retention and lacing. The aromas are floral along with some citrus notes. Mild hints of coconut in the mix. Some fresh grass. Some bread and crackers. Malts are there. The flavors basically follow the nose. Some grapefruit and orange coming through. More subtle hints of coconut. More fresh grass. More bread and crackers. Solid bitterness. Mild spiciness. Some black pepper coming through in the finish. Malts do their thing without dominating. Finishes juicy and dry at the same time, but it's probably on the juicier side. Alcohol goes unnoticed for the most part. Mouthfeel is nice. It's on the fuller side of medium-bodied with active carbonation. It's sharp, crisp, slightly fluffy, smooth and easy to drink.   This is a solid IPA. It's nice, but it's really nothing ""special"" based on the acclaim, in my opinion. It's not bad at all, but I guess I was just personally expecting something crazier. The craftsmanship is on point. Not bad at all.",0.7100839127609089,3.5,0.9829
Haze,"A - super beautiful hazy, off-yellow color, perfect oily lacing S - fruity, reminded me of pineapple, oranges, and passion fruit blended together  T - JUICY, amazing, and one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying. Didn't even remind me of an off the shelf double IPA. Completely different and I thank Tree House for that.  F - smooth, but somewhat thick. Perfection.   I can only describe it as amazingly juicy. Phenomenal. If you are lucky enough to see it, buy it. You'll thank me later.",0.6643700644977806,4.75,0.9829
Peche 'n Brett,"Purchased at Costco for $15.59. 750 ml bottles dated ""Best By 1/2020"". Poured into tulips and shared with good friends around a campfire on a warm summer evening.   Pours a gorgeous creamy pastel peach color with a thick, frothy head that sticks around and leaves tons of lace.  Aroma is almost straight-up peach, with just a hint of brett. Very fruity aroma.  Taste is also dominated by fresh and fruity peach, but with enough tartness to add complexity and just a slight aftertaste of straw and horse. No indication here of the high ABV.  Mouth is perfect. Creamy, smooth, silky, slightly dry, but enough fruit to fill your mouth.   Overall, this is a great fruit beer that builds on the already fantastic Soizen Bretta base beer. I'm glad I got two bottles.",0.6651022905818739,4.75,0.9829
Sure Bet,"It's funny to me that this is one of Pipeworks' highest rated beers, while their stouts haven't made top 250 - funny how the world spins.  Pipeworks distro in MN is still a bit in flux it appears as this bottle popped up in different places over a week or two - thankfully, I was able to grab one before it had too much age on it. This is one of those IPAs that I'm not sure I'd worry too much about age. It's not loaded with sediment and haze, so I think it might weather a bit better. It pours a much cleaner tangerine sort of color with a very nice, clean, sweet nose. The taste is similar, though it does seem to open up a bit as it warms. It has a bit of a ragged edge while too cold. Again, it's awfully sweet - that honey definitely comes through, while the mango provides plenty of tropical fruity sweetness. It's almost cloying in texture and mouthfeel - very rich, very thick.  I like Sure Bet - it's a pretty excellent IPA. As sweet as it is, I'm not sure I could stomach more than a glass at a time - so it's more of a novelty to me than anything. Great beer, but certainly not a go-to for me.",0.6630594215635508,4.25,0.9829
Society & Solitude #4,"Thanks to Sean for sharing this growler. Served in a Hopleaf tulip.  A - White foam settles to a thin cap and splotchy lace. Hazy golden body.  S - Big Galaxy hop aroma, with some zesty citrus in there as well. Lots of tropical fruits and bit of dankness, but this is a true double IPA with a good amount of sweet malts as well.  T - The flavor is also heavy on palate-numbing Galaxy hops and bruising bitterness. Again, lots of tropical fruits, citrus zest, as well as some sugary malts and toasted grains. Gets quite bitter after a few ounces.  M - Medium-full body, moderate carbonation, super dry finish, and well-hidden alcohol.  D - While this seems like a great idea on paper (Double Galaxy + Double Citra + ? = Profit), it's a little too bitter to enjoy in large quantities. I'm with Thorpe429 on this one - merely good, and probably my least favorite beer in the series.",0.6634180328621556,4.0,0.9828
Space Trace,"Tasted at Bottle Logic during the release. This poured jet black into a snifter, and I consumed over about 10 min as it warmed a bit in the hand. The nose is out of this world. Huge bourbon and coconut. it was literally like a chocolate soaked coconut ball dipped in bourbon. The taste followed the nose nicely. Bourbon was smooth, and the coconut was pretty evident. This was truly amazing, with a thick creamy mouthfeel. Can't wait to try it out of the bottle.  Edit: Just tasted this from the bottle, and it's even better than on tap!! Probably the best smelling beer I have ever put my nose near.",0.6344479696244536,4.75,0.9828
Juicy,"My favorite of Shaun's saisons/wilds yet. A fantastic mix of Belgian saison and an American wild - It certainly crosses stylistic lines with ease.  Warning!! This is a gusher! I lost about a half an ounce of this liquid gold and after tasting it I was in mourning for the rest of the evening;)   A bright orange glowing liquid when my snifter is held up to the light. Bubbles are supercharged to begin with before quickly taming down. A thin white head is left on the glass with a slight sticky lace from the preponderance of New Zealand hops used balanced perfectly with lightly roasted malt.  Wow! Holy shit!!! I can't believe that this beer doesn't contain fruit!!! Nose of tangerine, lemon, apricot, peach. Damn!  The taste follows through on the nose with the best aspects of so many great beers present. The best use of Brett since Orval. Fou' Foune juiciness (I swear there must be apricots or peaches in this, the mustiness of Fantome Saison and Consecration's currents and sombiosis all at once! And then the hops just scream citrus!!  Mouthfeel is spritzy with a high level of carbonation,but it dries out nicely and is very more-ish.

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"On tap at GTMW '09: Pours an opache black with a small dissipating tan head. Aroma is strong oak, fruity sweet (plums and raisins) and very rich. Flavor is strong oak yet very sweet with dark fruit, rich chocolate, coffee and a nice undertone of flower, herbs and grapefruit. Finish is very long and warm with molasses and dark fruit. Large bodied, quite a bit more alcohol apparent than the non oak version. Still one of the best beers I have ever tasted.",0.6724547896732181,4.5,0.9827
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Wow! You expect a lot at such a high price tag. Paid $27.99 at Beverage Warehouse in Winooski, VT. Eclipse did NOT disappoint.  L: Deep dark black. In a pint glass with a direct beam of setting sun on the other side of it, I could just barely see a hint of ruby in one tiny spot of the glass. The rest was pitch black. Lacy half inch of head.  S: Sweet, alcohol, chocolate. Intense.  T: Holy wow. Like an entire bar of the best Belgian dark chocolate dipped in Bourbon. A tiny hint of the espresso and mocha. Others have mentioned Vanilla, but I couldn't detect it. Mostly sweet chocolate and alcohol. But no bitter, biting after taste. Very smooth and clean.  F: Smooth and full, lingers slightly on the tongue, then gone. Very sweet. Very delicious.  O: I'm seriously impressed. The inflated price tag demands a stringent assessment, but Eclipse (or at least this Elijah Craig 12-Year variety of it) lives up to the expectations. Not the sort of thing you could drink every day, but certainly something stout lovers should sample at least once.",0.6210365637313104,5.0,0.9827
Society & Solitude #4,"Look: Straw yellow with hints of amber; totally cloudy, completely opaque. Pours with a thick, 2 finger, white cloud-like head that dies down very slowly leaving a thick, uneven layer of foam on the surface of the beer and large amounts of sticky lacing on the sides of the glass. Perfect!  Smell: Fresh cut grass, loads of citrus (think grapefruit), slight aroma of pine, acidic finish. Smells delicious and inviting.  Taste: Slight grassy-start, followed by a bold, citrus middle (grapefruit), with a mildly tart lemony citrus finish. No dry-bitter taste at all. Awesome!  Feel: Heavier-side of medium body. Rich, velvety feel to start; then a mild fizzy sensation from the carbonation, ending with slight pucker at the end. Refreshing - almost zero dryness at the finish.   Overall: I believe this is the best DIPA that I have ever had. Love it! I could drink this one over and over!",0.6890004108008896,5.0,0.9827
Sip Of Sunshine,"Well. It's early, but what we have here is the best beer of 2019 (so far) but I really don't get the tropical fruit thing, because this beer is good, very good, maybe great but tropical?. Seriously, wtf is the tropical thing these days? I like pineapple, and i like mango water ice, but this beer is not tropical at all, Just good, clean, crisp, smooth, satisfying, beautifully balanced between bitter and sweet, and just so damn drinkable. Citrus and pine, the aforementioned bitter and sweet, is it as good as my all time favorite IPA's by Port Brewing? No, but then again, Port Brewing doesn't know how to make or market a beer anymore. Don't get me started on them, they're way overdue for an nasty gram. So this will do, well done, I had one single Friday, another today, and immediately went and invested my $18 in a 4 pack on this bitter cold, afternoon, after work. And while we're on the subject, fuck work.",0.638350448111922,4.5,0.9827
Green,"Pours a hazy yellow, not a lot of foam.  Smell is juicy and lovely. Most of the citrus family is prominent here, and I love the lime.  The taste is very much like the nose, all citrus all the time here. Adds a bit of grass to the finish.  Just like all Tree House, very soft and smooth. Great to drink.  Overall, a superb beer, huge on the citrus and really easy to drink.",0.6668901439483248,4.5,0.9827
Chocolate Rain,"A: Chocolate aroma upfront, boozy, with lots of vanilla character, followed by a moderate oak and bourbon presence.  A: Black color, so dark it almost looks opaque, with a thin tan head that quickly dissipates into a ring around the glass.  T: Lots of chocolate like flavor, fair amount of malt sweetness with lots of bourbon character, moderately light cherries and a moderate roast bitterness.  M: Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Big and boozy, there is definitely some alcoholic warmth, but is not sharp or hash.   O: Tasty; the beer is huge and has a great chocolate and vanilla aroma and flavor. However, the last few years the beer has been gaining ABV strength and has made the beer a bit less approachable, because of the ample alcoholic warmth, dialed back a bit this would make the beer even better.",0.6802304686777544,4.25,0.9827
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Vintage 2012, 15% ABV. Thanks to my friend, Matt, for cracking this open for us! L- opaque black with a tan head S - very rich with dark chocolate, coffee, caramel, boozy bourbon, toffee, toasted grain, vanilla, oak T - wickedly sweet with bourbon, booze, toffee, caramel, vanilla, oak, dark chocolate, roasted barley; definitely a sipper, but hard to get down because it is so overly sweet F - full bodied, creamy, finishes with a lingering sweetness O - love being able to try this extreme rarity. It delivers in a big way with its bold, complex flavors, but it's way too sweet.",0.6437065967599124,4.5,0.9826

S: Super complex, big fruity peach and mango, oakiness, funk notes, more citrus, beautiful aroma on this thing. T: Extremely well balanced - oak and barrel, punchy tropical fruit and citrus, light white wine, slightly acidic.  M: Crisp and clean, super drinkable. O: Wanted this to be as good as I hoped and it certainly was. Would love to drink this more often, just a joy to drink.",0.7193450161249255,4.75,0.9826
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"L- Dark brown to black, not much head.   S- Sweet aroma, combination of maple, milk chocolate and vanilla. Bourbon is the other main smell.   T- Bourbon is the most prominent flavor and it's pretty forward. After that dies down a bit, there's a sweet maple and chocolate flavor.   F- It had a good, rich thickness when it was still cold. It's not quite as rich when it warms up, but still smooth with a good mouth coating. Tastes thicker than it pours.   O- It's pretty good, but could be better. The bourbon overpowers the maple just a bit too much. A little more of the base would bump it up a fair amount.",0.6715534526149111,4.0,0.9826
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"500 ml bottle poured into a weizen glass.  Pours a pale golden straw color that is slightly hazy and has a good amount of bubbles rising through the pour. The two plus finger head is white, thick and lasting, it looks like a giant glob of whipped cream was plastered on top of the beer. Nose is fair in strength with nice aromas of bananas, wheat and yeast over a bready malt base.  The taste is similar but more robust with honey suckle and hints of orange. It drinks smooth with a crisp clean finish and just a bit of bite from the moderate to high carbonation. The body is just full enough to call it medium and adds to the refreshing easy drinking experience that this provides. I agree with the ""world class"" rating. Excellent!  Recommended to all.",0.6924332340078473,4.5,0.9826
Darkstar November,"500 ml bottle into snifter; 2014 vintage, bottle # 2065. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, molasses, licorice, toffee, toast, vanilla, bourbon, oak, coconut, light raisin/plum, and oak/roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, molasses, licorice, toffee, toast, vanilla, bourbon, oak, coconut, light raisin/plum, and oak/roasted earthiness. Light amount of oak/bourbon spice and roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, molasses, licorice, toffee, toast, vanilla, bourbon, oak, coconut, light raisin/plum, and oak/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming lingering after the finish. Overall this is an incredible barrel aged imperial stout. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.",0.6755040104591641,4.5,0.9826
Black Tuesday,"A - As advertised: Black as night  S - Bourbon front and center. Then oak, dark fruits, almost like a chocolate-covered cherry.  T - Bourbon dominates with dark fruits. A really sweet beer, but even after you get past the warming sensation that engulfs your chest, it actually is pretty damn smooth for being over 18% abv.  M - Thick with decent carbonation  O - High expectations weren't quite met, but this is still a good barrel-aged stout. You really need to be a fan of sweet beers to like this one. Served at room temperature this is a bourbon-soaked dark fruit stout with some balls. Very good, but in my opinion (and I can't stress enough: MY OPINION) it didn't live up to it's reputation.",0.6371996369352197,4.25,0.9826
Dragonsaddle,"Dragonsaddle is only moderately hazed, giving a unique look in the 3 HH cans sampled today, a bit darker than its counterparts with a hue that goes just beyond amber. The head is a tall, frothy one with great hold and stick. Not only does the pillow stand for a good while, but lacing coats the glass very nicely as the beer drops as well. This one's all about the tropical fruits, but it incorporates citrus, dankness, pine and earth in a way that makes the balance and complexity even more impressive than Hoof Hearted's similar offerings. Spiciness, sweetness and bitterness all come together in a unique and effective way to make this one of the more exceptional IIPAs on the market. Not only that, but the malt balance does just enough to make this beer drinkable in a way it couldn't be without. The body is full and weighty without being too heavy on the palate. It's got a nice melding of crispness and smoothness, going into a finish that's dry but not harsh. Alcohol warms and builds up with each sip, so it's one to be careful with.",0.7412532899994744,4.5,0.9825
Coconut B-Bomb,"Tremendous. Tops my previous favorite for use of coconut in a BBA stout (Half Acre's Benthic).... (had on tap 1.15.19) L - Dark lacing, opaque, a heavy hitter. Do not underestimate the power of the dark side... S - Holy moly, coconuts all the way to the bottom with good use of barrel aging, roast T - Follows with the aroma; fantastic, you're drinking an alcoholic's version of a Mounds bar my friend F - Great balance, carbonation, not cloying, maybe with taste/feel a little sticky sweet but just delicious. O - Maybe the best coconut RIS I've had. Just wow. Ugh. Also, don't get any sugar bloodwork done the next day. ;)",0.6285314298804222,4.5,0.9825
Juicy,"Big big big thank you to Franklinn for sending me this treat. Cheers man!!  Appearance. Pours a rich, hazy, peachy orange with a finger of off white head that leaves some clouds and pretty lace behind on the sides of the glass.  Smell. Just awesome. Mangoes and papaya, sweet citrus flesh and melon, a bit of peaches and pineapple with a sweet and lightly peppery saison yeast and woody white wine. Oh man...  Taste. Fresh squeezed yellow grapefruit juice, dry woody white wine, orange zest and grassy hops, and some tropical fruits with a slight trace of savory herbs. There's some bitterness in the form of grass and yellow grapefruit rinds in the fairly dry finish. Something reminiscent of brett as well, in a lighter, more earthy way.   Mouthfeel. Medium body, below medium fine and fairly smooth carbonation.  Overall. These guys really know their shit. Just an amazing brew with a very fitting name. Here's hoping that many many brewers try to follow suit with the type of saisons being put out by this place. I would buy this by the case on a weekly basis if I could ...which makes me ask why the hell can't I??? Thanks again Franklinn, awesome of you to hook me up!",0.6671664435041016,4.75,0.9824
Sang Noir,"Corked and caged 750mL bottle from Sprayberry Bottle Shop (Marietta, GA). 28.99. 2014 vintage. Served in a Bruery snifter.   Pours a muddy cherrywood tinged dull brown. Opaque other than some rosey highlights at the edges when viewed under the light. The finger and a half frothy, khaki head gradually fades to a milky haze and full collar that leaves a couple huge clouds of lace. Muddy as hell but strangely attractive.   Vibrant, robustly sour aroma. Sour cherry, barrel funk, wine, strong vinegar, earthy, caramel, wood shavings and some vague tart fruit. I can tell this will be quite a ride.   Flavors are an intense mixture of sweet and sour. Tart cherries, barrel funk, wine, raisin bread, soft bourbon, lemonade, near puckering lacto, earthy, funky, caramel and brown sugar. I think there's a bit of alcohol but the sour is so potent that it is difficult to tell. This is a boldly tasty flavor trip with tart cherries and funky barrel notes in the drivers seat.   Full, creamy feel with pleasingly faint carbonation. Funky notes of wine barrel and sour cherries linger in the long aftertaste.   Welcome to Georgia, Cascade! Sang Noir is a rather beastly sour and I dig it. It is so much fuller than most wild ales I've had and has a sweetness that may not balance the sourness but sure gives it a nice counterpoint. Arguably a bit pricey but I enjoyed the experience and will be trying more from Cascade.",0.6703999983157375,4.5,0.9824
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"REVIEW # 999  2012 750mL bottle poured into taster - thanks Pat. Opened alongside DL 10-12 and Brandy Vanilla DL 11 as part of our holiday StoutFest tasting.  Pours a viscous blackness with a thin crop of darkly tanned, brownie colored head. Dissolves swiftly into a collar of film with a few spots of lacing on the glass while drinking.   Absolutely explosive nose filled with thunderous bourbon character. Warm and boozy layered with syrupy sweetness, chocolate, smooth vanilla and charred oak. Leathery and slightly smoky with a hint of dark fruit and roasted dark malts. Intense, complex and intoxicating - even before sipping.   Aggressive, yet delicious bourbon character right up front on the tongue, driven by boozy heat and sticky, syrupy sweetness. Rich vanilla and oak with light touches of dark fruit and raisin. Chocolate dark malt with warming roastiness. Having this alongside the base beer, this isn't remotely the same - the barrel aging completely elevates Dark Lord to a new level and somehow seems to temper the near-sickening cloying sweetness. Finishes rich, sweet and boozy with a chocolately note.   Fullest of the full bodies, heavy on the tongue, sticky and chewy on the tongue. While the 2011 Brandy Vanilla Dark Lord stole the show, this was a completely awe-inspiring beer. As I come to the realization that I really don't enjoy Dark Lord all that much, the barrel aged variations are some of the finest stouts I've ever had. I honestly had a hard time believing they were the same beer.",0.6690669366955945,5.0,0.9824
Swish,"From 04/19/15 notes. 16 oz. can poured into a pint glass. Big thanks to BeerLawyer85 for giving me this as a wedding present; thanks Ross!  Didn't take a ton of notes on this one but loved it. Lots of citrus hops, tropical fruits, and fruity malts to it. Not bitter at all and very drinkable, tons of fresh fruits and hops throughout. Loved it and would love to have it again sometime.",0.5869799964763877,4.5,0.9824
Todd The Axe Man,"A big thank you to Matt for this.  Todd The Axeman, despite all the suspended particles pours the most beautiful light orange. The foamy white head is relentless, and plasters the glass.  My God, this smells glorious. Tons of sweet and smooth citrus, crushed candy, and pine. Very grapefruit forward, yet refined and mellowed by suggestions of tropical fruits.  Citrus dominates once again. It kind of has an old skool sappy flavor to it, and likewise is intensely saturated with damp pine throughout the finish. And it doesn't seem to fade.  The feel is rich, medium to full bodied and heavily bittered. The carbonation is just strong enough to lift it to smoothness.  Todd The Axeman is an unforgiving IPA. It has the intensity and heft if a DIPA or even TIPA, yet dialed back to an almost standard for the modern era 7.2%. It's a beer to savor for sure, and I'd be Keen to savor it often.   Thanks again Matt. Cheers!",0.6805908253612931,4.5,0.9823
Blanc De Blancs,"375ml bottle poured into a Side Project oversized wine glass.  The beer pours a golden color, hues of oranges and yellows, very hazy with a fizzy head, barely a finger, white color with low retention and just a spot or two of lace. The aroma is of strong white wine, champagne, sour grapes, tart apples, lemon citrus, funky yeast and oak, quite acetic as well. The flavors are really sharply sour, vinous grapes, lemon citrus, green apples, really bitingly sour, funk and oak come out as well, but boy was this sour. The mouthfeel is nice, very carbonated, bubbly, coats the mouth very well, finishes dryly and a bit sharply, but with a light warming sensation from the alcohol.  Verdict: A very interesting beer from Side Project. Much like Fuzzy, the nose was immaculate, capturing the perfect essence of chardonnay grapes and white wine, but the flavors are crippled by how sour the beer is and while enjoyable, difficult to handle more than a few ounces. The ABV was expertly hidden, which was a nice touch, but still, the overwhelming acidic sourness is hard to get past.",0.6804410251954041,4.75,0.9823
Green,"Poured into Teku glass from a 16oz can. Looks like Orange/Pineapple juice.  Smell is what the visuals portray. Juice and Hops. BIG time. There is so much hop aroma, you almost get worried its not going to be the juice bomb you hope it will be.  Taste calms you right back down, as you covered in a juicy hoppy explosion of epic proportions. Super juicy, super hoppy, very minimal bitterness.. Its a great representation of the style.   Feel is good. Medium to medium heavy. Slightly sticky in a very good way, but not cloying at all. How you want it too feel.  Its not just a great NEIPA, its a great IPA in general. Enough bite to keep it from being boring, with plenty of juice to keep you happy. The hype is warranted. Trade for it, Drive for it, whatever, its worth seeking out.",0.6630622306183196,4.5,0.9823
Oude Geuze Vintage,"2002 vintage, served cool in a broad-rimmed goblet, on 11/03/2006. I was very happy to bump into this bottle at the Quinn's, Camden Town, just several days after my birthday, as the bottling date and month (07/03/2002) coincides with that of my BD, and this was the last bottle in the fridge--almost like a belated birthday gift for me~~  A: pours a hazy, honeyish golden hue, coming with a big frothy beer head, with ever-lasting foam on top; moderate, constant carbonation. S: saw-dusty woody, (unknown) spice, lots of lemon peels and cider-like sour yet savoury aroma, added force by raw-ish and musty yeastiness and smoothly sweet wheat-malts... overall the note is only medium-sour, and really is colourful and harmonious for a potentially aggressively tart geuze. T: an incredibly dry-ish palate of sour-sweet wheats hand in hand with a lime-fruity and barrel-aged cider flavour, magnifies quickly on the palate... the wheat-ness goes deeper while the lime-zestiness is elevated to the upper level of the palate; simultaneously, woodchip-like, slightly rough edge and bitterness as of white grapefruits along with plenty of tannins dominates the mouthfeel; slowly but surely, the palate turns drier and drier, leaving a zesty-tangy and tannic, almost slightly clashing/rusty, mouthfeel deeply attached to the tongue and also b/w the teeth... M&D: a surprisingly soft body supports the otherwise very dry palate, backed by constantly refreshing fizziness that takes some time to soften on the tongue... The overall flavour profile shows a sourness being well-tamed through four years of ageing. This is the first geuze I've had for more than a year, and I feel really satisfied with the depth and complexity this four-year old geuze has shown. I'm totally convinced that this bottle was reserved at the pub for ME!!",0.6968877454815391,4.5,0.9823

Oude Geuze Vintage,"Side-by-side at Lambik O Droom. All of them had that signature green apple and barnyard funk but I'm gonna focus more on what distinguishes them from each other/from typical bottles of Oude Geuze. 2003 OGV: orange-gold color, full and thicker body, plenty of carb, old and musty, huge brett pineapple, shellfish notes, super unique and absolutely delicious: 4.9 2004 OGV Magnum: bright and well-balanced. Apparently the bottles had a lot of off flavors originally and they were thinking they would have to dump these bottles. They held onto them, and I'm so glad they did. Totally turned the corner: 4.8 2008 OGV: tons of funk yet relatively mellow compared to the rest, smooth and absurdly balanced: 4.9 2010 OGV: super balanced but the least interesting of the five: 4.75 2012 OGV: Paint and drywall, smells and tastes like a new townhome, incredibly cheesy.

Mastermind,"L - clouded, small head, miny sediment chunks sink to the bottom  S - candied citrus, orange, grapefruit, peach, melon. No alcohol detected. Amazingly juicy - like I'm about to take a bite into a real piece of fruit. Wet grain/malt towards the back?   T - pulpy grapefruit (without the bitterness) hits up front and lingers throughout. Crisp and clean. Bright citrus everywhere.   F - tingly, vibrant. I'm torn because it's the most crushable DIPA I've ever had the pleasure of trying but it lacks the body I'm looking for in the finish. Ends up slightly watery but still very good.   O - it's been a while since I've had a dIPA like this. Changes things up a bit and doesn't just smack you in the face like so many do. Well balanced, bright and extremely drinkable. One of my favorites.",0.6962539637756424,4.25,0.9822
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a dark brown foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of intense black chocolate notes with residual sugar notes and some nice bourbon, oak and vanilla notes. Taste is a great mix of black chocolate notes with some residual sugar notes, light tobacco notes with some smooth vanilla, oak and bourbon notes with light warming alcohol notes. Body is full with nice creamy texture and good carbonation with light warming alcohol notes. Pretty much perfect BA imperial stout.",0.6685305472053489,4.75,0.9821
Swish," a hazy pale orange in color with nearly 2 fingers of white head. Love the aroma, I get melon, cantaloupe, mango, and lots of smooth tropical fruits. Tastes great, mirrors the aroma but leans more towards the tropical fruit notes. Medium-light body and moderate carbonation. This is strikes a great balance. The mouthfeel is great, it's wonderfully tropical. I'm not upset that I waited in line for the first release of the season, I very much enjoyed this beer as did my fiancé.",0.7006421565524719,4.75,0.9821
Beatification,"Batch 6 Bottled on 9/11/13 Poured into a standard tulip glass.   Appearance: (4.5) Pours a lightly hazed golden yellow with a mere wisp of a white head that immediately dissolves about as quickly as it formed. For a sour beer, this really has some nice clarity, it almost glows.   Aroma: (4.75) As soon as the beer is poured, a burst of clean, but very juicy citrus-y tartness makes it's presence known. The sourness is very lemon forward and doesn't come close to taking on an acetic, vinegar-y tone. Beneath this acidity are aromas of juicy, ripe apricots, peaches as well as some notes of white pepper. Being 100% spontaneously fermented, there is an earthiness, but it is very soft and supple, really just providing some nice balance to the bright nose. AS soon as the beer warms, some of the vinous barrel tones become apparent; predominately just a soft vanilla undertone.   Taste: (4.75) As the beer lands on your palate, you're hit by a wave of juicy acidity; mostly lemon juice and pineapple juice. Layered underneath this sourness is a soft bedding of light stone fruits; apricot flesh, ripe peaches. These fruity components are supported by a light coating of barnyard funk; damp earth, wet hay. The beer finishes very dry and tart with long lingering notes of lemon juice and peel, pineapple, apricot, leather and a buttery, vanilla tone from the barrels.   Mouthfeel:(4.5) Medium bodied, with moderate to high carbonation.   Overall: (4.5) Beatification is Russian River's 100% spontaneously fermented sour that is made in homage to some of the great Lambic producer's of Belgium; Cantillion, Drie Fontenien, etc. The finished product is extremely complex and highly recommended.",0.6931620008677063,4.5,0.9821
Darkstar November,"With the spice of rye and the savory sweetness of molasses, the mad scientists at Bottle Logic come up with a nonlogical ale that doesn't make any sense outside of wowing the palate with utter indulgence.  Pitch black and quickly thwarting any meaningful foam, the stout quickly looks like tar sitting in the glass, but with slight tawny bronze edged and legging. Decadence ensues with the very first scent of dark chocolate, whisky, espresso and molasses. Just as the booze tingles the nose with a tangy peppery sensation, its lavishly malted taste glides onto the middle palate with a dense cakey taste and texture.  Along the middle palate, the beer's reckless malt sweetness latches tightly onto each and every tastebud and endures the session easily. Meanwhile the complex flavors of bittersweet chocolate, black walnut, rich espresso and slightly burnt brownies give the session a pastry-like taste and texture. Molasses brings a kiss of butterscotch along with savory, complex and robust charm that melds seamlessly with the oaken character of whisky, coconut, caramel and vanilla late on the palate.  Ridiculously full and creamy on the tongue, the beer doesn't need any meaningful carbonation for its silky smooth, velvety and marshmallowy texture. Simmering warmth gives the beer a spicy offset to the density of malt while the grit of rye whisky keeps complex tastes coming late. A long linger of molasses brings the beer to the edge of sherry and port while retaining an imperial stout identity.",0.7098283915689645,4.5,0.9821
Society & Solitude #4,"Wow! Just wow! My favorite Hill Farmstead beer. Possibly my favorite beer of all time. Although, at the time of writing this, I've still yet to have any of the Treehouse IPA's.   Pours a very hazy light golden orange color. Almost looks like sludgy orange juice with a nice fluffy off white head. Smells like oranges and tangerines. Very explosive aroma. Tastes like orange and citrus juice. Also has a candy like or maybe a creamsicle flavor. Crazy good. Almost no bitterness to be found. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy. The other HF IPA's and IIPA's I've had seem restrained. This one is not. The hoppiness is unapologetic. What an awesome brew! Wish I could drink it all the time.",0.6229056577353236,5.0,0.982
Society & Solitude #4,"Ok double galaxy meets double citra here we go.  A- murky ultra HF yellow an excellent off white head of foam. Spider-Man like lacing reaches to the side as the brew completely glows in the glass. The most vibrant look you can ever expect. The body screams DIPA  S- there it is.... Papaya, mango, citrus, pineapple, tropical oasis in a glass! Citra and galaxy accompanied by a prickly pine scent that is combined to create something you can only find from HF. This is what is meant by the terminology tropical bouquet. The scent is viral as it bursts into your nostrils and literally clings there. It's perfect... A utopia of DIPA's if you will  T- a cascade of smooth pineapple and mango glides over the tongue while some fresh waves of grass and mild earthiness dust along. So clean and full of a citric hop bouquet. Waves of prickly pineapples coate, sting, and consume the entire mouth. This is the real deal. Massively clean and constructed to dominate with a shade of bitterness  M- HF creaminess and carbonated flavor blasts the palate. Absolutely wicked.  O- I never thought I could have a beer that topped Double Galaxy. Well... Society and Solitude 4 just tied it! This tropical apocalypse just manifested itself as the best beer I have ever had (tied with DG). Unbelievably clean and full of the best hop profile one can ask for. Shaun Hill is the best brewer in the history of mankind. I'm serious",0.6833286431307121,5.0,0.982
Green,"Snagged Julius and Green at the brewery yesterday. Cracked Green the same day it was brewed, after 2-3 hours in the fridge to chill. Pouring it into a pint glass I immediately catch the rich aroma of hops and fruit, which is remarkably potent. Once in the glass the beer is completely opaque.  The taste of the beer very closely follows the smell. It is rich, incredibly flavorful, complex and yet smooth as can be. Unlike Julius, which I found to be a tad subdued for my liking, Green packs an intense burst of hops that fills your mouth with each sip and then fades without any bitterness whatsoever. It is truly remarkable.  Green is as good or better than anything I have previously drank. I have nothing to criticize, except that I cannot buy it at my local beer store. Find it and enjoy.",0.6673554215651751,5.0,0.982
Darkstar November,"This is the 2018 edition. Had on tap at the source.  L: Pours pitch black. Chestnut ring around the edge of glass. Viscous looking with minimal residual lacing.  S: Molasses is abundant on the nose, followed by bourbon. Notes of black licorice, dark fruits, caramel, toffee and malts also detectible. Smells complex and fantastic.  T: Molasses-forward. I love that I pick up the rye character on the flavor, adding an additional depth to the complexity. Finish is bourbon heat with lingering malt/molasses flavor. Moderate bitterness with the perfect pinch of sweetness to round it out.  F: The most disappointing aspect. Somewhat thin and light in bodied. Carbonation was appropriate but it didn't have the weight I love in other BL offerings.  O: A damn good brew. Masks the abv well and I would definitely try again. I am glad to have tried.

Chocolate Rain,"I tried this 2013 vintage chilled in a nonic from the 750ml. Enjoyed at the looking forward to spring stout tasting.  The color is dark brown with ruby hues when held to the light with light beige head with fine bead. The smell has a dark sugar and cocoa/fig-like earthy and raisiny aroma with slight alcohol odor. The feel is intense, big bold with rich viscous texture and more alcohol than average yet not over the top for the abv.  The taste is like a raisinette -mostly raisin with some chocolate in the taste which is more on the dark cocoa side with a slight yeast flavor and sweet dark sugar and vinous elements with a slight alcohol flavor that lasts after the swallow with so much residual sugar it leaves my lips sweet and I can taste the intensity as I lick them. This is one of the most intensely rich beers I have ever had -so much sweet qualities with strong alcohol in the taste which is the only drawback for me.",0.6791244650451467,4.25,0.982
Sip Of Sunshine,"From the tall boy can in a Leffe snifter via a brew trade---Thanks Zid! This robust IPA pours a medium bright amber with a nice head if white foam that settles to a thick ring, thin milky layer, and showcases some of the best sudsy/ milky foam I have seen in an IPA. Nose of moderate pine, light mango, moderate pineapple, light peach, and light honey malt touched with caramel malts. Flavors hit the note with a honey and caramel malt backbone that is whipped into shape  with medium heavy pine notes that take the fore over light pineapple and a hint  of apple with a heavy bittering hop flavor. excellent mouth feel; medium light carbonation, medium light mouth feel, and a lightly sweet yet medium strong  pine laden hop finish.   What more would one expect from Vermont?  Excellent!  Cheers!",0.6765278180943044,4.5,0.982

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Double imported Cantillon. 2002 Vintage, with a 2004 printed on the cork. Bottled and imported from Belgium first by Belgian Beer Paradise, then bought in Brazil and sent to America in 2012. Now it's ready to drink in 2013. Let's hope the cork works with me. Coming out of a 750 ml bottle, on to the beer:  The cork is a little mushy, but I am able to put the cork opener into it without having it fall apart. Pull out, pour into a glass, get a muddy brownish pink color with no head on the pour. No worries. The aroma gets me in a good way, plenty acidic with some good doses of raspberries which still remain 9 years later. A rustic barnyard note sits behind all that. Somehow, the aromas are balanced very well.   As one could expect, this one attacks your palate in several ways. It's plenty acidic, which is a given, not just from being a Cantillon, but also the raspberries bring a pleasant acidic that's not so sharp as say, Fou Foune. Yet the raspberries also bring some tart, sour, and sweet flavors which soak into the palate and help this beer going down. It's surprisingly drinkable despite the intense activity and fullness found in the liquid.   Suffice to say, this is a fun and lovely fruit lambic. At a decade old, there's still plenty of life in this bottle, a bottle which I plan to finish on my own tonight.",0.6367578806700255,4.75,0.9819

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"This is one of the prettiest beers to look at. Big foamy head and beautiful yellow-orange gold color, lots of carbonation. Smells very spicy and fruity, slightly fermented fruit, very sweet. Tastes crisp and also very spicy, cloves, and with some subtle fruitiness that isn't as strong as I think some people make it sound. This is a good thing, as I prefer the wheaty, honey drizzled bready flavors over sweet fruit. Feels super crisp and light, very refreshing and drinkable. Perfect for a warm, sunny day. Overall this is a veritable classic, and certainly deserves its acclaim.",0.7196542132580704,4.25,0.9819
Black Tuesday,"2016 Edition. 1 Pint, 9.4oz. 20.3% ABV. Poured into a standard tulip.  Look: Pours jet black, surprisingly high head of light tan, bubbly foam. Smell: Very sweet! Notes of dark fruit, hints of chocolate with a slight booziness. Taste: Incredibly smooth! Like this is 20.3, seriously?? A warm but pleasant warmth, with a body comparable to a barleywine. Many of the tastes found here are of burnt toffee, caramel, malt, and hints of toast.  Feel: Again, so incredibly smooth. A lighter body than expected , with a good amount of carbonation and an expected amount of stickiness.  An incredible addition to my beer repertoire, although different than what I expected. Regardless, an amazing beer worthy of the hype.",0.6863572154592991,4.5,0.9818
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Full vertical provided by myself, Jason, and Sean. We even had the Cuvée Valentijn and two different bottlings from 2005. Served in various tasters.  A - Other than the flat 2006, most had voluminous off-white foam that settled to a thick collar, partial cap, and minimal lace. Hazed golden apricot body that got increasingly murky as the bottles emptied. Surprisingly there were no gushers in this collection.  S - Most of the vintages were heavy on musty barn, green funk, some feet, cheese, hay and grass, lemon, stone fruits, and hints of vanilla and oak. Unlike Cantillon, or even the 3F '03 Oude Geuze we sampled side-by-side, these are fairly restrained in acetobacter and sourness. The '02 was incredibly dusty and leathery. A few had a vaguely moldy note.  T - Taste is slightly more sour, with lemons, stone fruits, and a perceptible pale malt and wheat backdrop. There's some tart appleskins, hay, leather, and grass. Only light kiss of malt sweetness and vanilla in the periphery.  M - Spritzy and light in body, but smooth on the palate. Very dry and lightly tannic finish. Clean and refreshing.  D - I think we put down over a gallon of gueze last night. Wish we got this on draft, as it'd be a superb session brew.  Warning - the 2006 vintage was very weird. No carbonation, cloying sweetness, and not at all like the bottle mentioned in drabmuh's review. It's almost as if the yeast and bacteria went dormant. If you have a 2006 with foil overwrap and a synthetic cork, you may want to sit on it for a few more years in the hopes that it develops. The rest of these are superb and can be consumed now.  In order I liked 2002, 2007 (CV), 2005 (February), 2004, 2003, and 2005 (December), and I disliked 2006. The Oude Geuze '03 was a totally different beast, with lots of lactic sourness and less funk, even though it was bottled only a month before the Oude Geuze Vintage '03. Batch variation? Cellar conditions? Who knows?  In any case, a thoroughly enjoyable experiment that is well worth repeating in the future.",0.6679623129574951,4.5,0.9818
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2007 vintage...very awesome. Beer is PINK and hazy and forms a nice pink head with moderate to high carbonation. The head falls away leaving no lacing on the glass (its not expected to). Looks great.  Aroma is sour and tart with some acetic notes and strong raspberry character. One of the best smelling beers I've ever had. Classic Cantillon smell.  Beer is very tart and not as acetic as I thought it was going to be, this is probably a good thing but the acetic character would likely grow over time slightly. There is nice raspberry flavors and good fruit tartness at the back. Some lactic notes and a slightly tannic quality overall as well. Nice carbonation in the mouth and highly drinkable. This could be one of my favorite Cantillons so far.",0.6766385094493549,4.0,0.9818

Blanc De Blancs,"Thanks to Harrison8 for this one. Blend 2. 12oz bottle poured into 12oz tulip. Poured a cloudy straw yellow color with a head of tight, white bubbles that were dissipating quickly as the beer poured. In fact, there was no head left even as I finished the pour. Obviously, there was no lacing. But, the sound of the effervescence from the carbonation was amazing. i could hear the beer from arms length.  The aroma was a pleasantly confusing mixture of grains, yeast, funk, some floral notes (hops?), grapes, and maybe some oak? Wutever, there was plenty of goodness going on.  On the tongue, similar scenario: so much going on, it's hard to describe. Every sip gives a different perspective. some very nice tartness.  The body was light and crisp, with a very dry finish.  Drinkability was awesome. i couldn't decide if I wanted sip it, or slam it. If I had two bottles, I woulda done both.  Overall, a great beer. A must try if you get the chance.",0.6552068027415747,4.75,0.9818
Double Orange Starfish,"There is no date on the bottom of the can or the label. Edit: I checked the other cans in the 4-pack and a couple of them are all smudged and on the edges of the can. One legibly states ""YOU CAN'T TOUCH THIS 03/01/17 10:55:23""  Appearance: The body of the beer is a medium-light shade of orange with a tint of brown and it is completely opaque. It looks a lot like grapefruit juice (not the ruby red kind). The white head is short and creamy textured.  Aroma: It has a very light grapefruit aroma with a bit of lime. The beer has a very restrained aroma.  Taste: Lime comes to the palate first and it is followed by some grapefruit flavor and a bit of a grainy flavor. That grain flavor starts to fade the more I drink the beer and it is overtaken by more of the grapefruit-like flavor. The aftertaste has just a touch of a caramel sweetness and a bit of a grain flour taste.  Mouthfeel: It is smooth and it has a very thick mouthfeel. Good bitterness. It is a good drinking beer.  Overall: It is a good beer but the aroma is lacking. It's not a beer I would pick up regularly but I would enjoy it every once and a while. It fits in nicely with other more citrus focused Double IPA's. The beer also has a lot of particulate matter (looks like a lot of hop particles) which collects towards the bottom and is pretty thick, so as a warning I would treat it like most naturally carbonated beers and leave a couple of ounces in the bottom of the can when drinking.",0.6900755778519599,3.5,0.9818
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Poured 5/17/17 from a 32oz growler that was filled at the brewery on 5/15/17, into a mug glass.  A: The beer is a very cloudy light gold color, with a short off-white head that fades quickly and leaves a thin lace on the glass.  S: The aroma contains very fruity citrus (tangerine & orange), floral and dank hops and caramelized malts.  T: The taste starts out sweet with strong fruity flavors of tangerine, orange and other citrus fruits. Then a strong floral hops bitterness quickly follows. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings a very good balance. The after-taste is hoppy and slightly sweet.  M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.  O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent IPA to drink for a long time.",0.7072964198795393,4.75,0.9818
Haze,"Poured from a 750ml growler filled 3/19/16 into a 12 ounce tulip. The look is cloudy and opaque. It looks like pineapple juice but a little darker and more orange. Small, white head, which dissipated quickly, leaving moderate lacing. The smell is strong oranges - almost smells like orange juice - with a hoppiness coming through underneath. The mouthfeel is very smooth with medium carbonation. The taste is strong citrus - orange, and some grapefruit - but the hop presence is much stronger than I expected from the smell. In no way is any one flavor overpowering. This beer is incredibly balanced with no hint of alcohol. Overall, this beer is fantastic and very easy to drink. I completely understand the hype on the beer, and Tree House, if all their IPAs follow the quality of this one. Every taste gives me a little hint of different flavors. I'll definitely look for more from them, given the chance.",0.6842630949754187,4.5,0.9817
Green,On draft one of the best beers I’ve ever had.   Beautiful perfect haze  The easiest and most flavorful beer I’ve ever had. Crazy creamy and easy to drink  Perfection  Edit-2019: This is the best beer I've ever had. I was finally able to grab a case of this! Perfection in a glass.,0.6354015288085779,5.0,0.9817
Sip Of Sunshine,"Pours a translucent, golden amber with a nice frothy white head. The clarity of the beer is astounding, given the prevalence of hazy/turbid IPAs these days. Lacing is strong, lasts down the side of my Cowboys glass. Here's to a better season next year.   Tropical fruit, mango and star fruit, and a malt-provided sweetness that melds well with the hop aroma. Tons of complexity that comes together to create something greater than the sum of its parts.   Wow. Really tropical up front, very fruity, followed by a slight bubblegum that races across the sides of the tongue, followed by a mixture of dank pine and more fruitiness, but this time its more grapefruit and orange rind than tropical.   Mouthfeel is medium, nicely carbonated, a thin coat of resin left behind on the tongue. There's a nice softness to it, as well.  Really fantastic coming out of a can dated 12/19. I have had this previously, albeit a bit older, and the freshness of this can lets beer shine more as the brewers probably want. I understand why this holds a high standing in the pantheon of northeast IPAs.",0.6887925407186085,4.5,0.9817
Green,"Damn good, wow! Green is a truly remarkable beer. Right from the beginning of the pour the sinfully decadent aroma hit me right in the face. Going in for the sip and everything from the nose follows through with the flavor. Just a glorious hop explosion that is some of the finest nectar the world has to offer coats the palate and rides out gracefully with the malt and yeast backbone. This may overtake haze as my favorite treehouse beer and is easily the best regular American IPA I have ever had, by a wide margin.",0.6557524817028549,5.0,0.9817
Black Tuesday,"Considering the Hype on this beer, I had to get a hold of ONE. Scored on the raffle this year, and comp 3 bottles.  Bottle poured in a snifter glass  A. Poured deep rich black with a hue of amber/brown, little to no head cream in color  S. Toasted charred wood with a hint of bourbon note, light vanilla and caramel in addition bold malt, chocolate, and molasses, which i think hides the most 18% alcohol well yet tingle the nostril.   T. Had a nice well balance base of chocolate, molasses, and slight licorice. In front was an underwhelming taste of bourbon, but a prominent deep yet not overpowering hint of oak and vanilla that I thought was lovely. On the back, there was a nice touch of charred wood similar to Smoking Wood which didn't pack a strong punch, but linger with a hint of alcohol sweetness and dissipated slowly.   Mouth feel was fairly balance, but to my taste was a little on the heavy side which can be overwhelming if you're drinking 12-16oz. lovely velvet texture that coats the mouth and smooth  O. Great overall beer, well balance smooth deep roasted chocolate and rich malt. I can see the hype of the beer because for 18% ABV I mention little alcohol presence, but I felt it lacks something, and personally I don't know what that is. To me everything seem like it was blended amazingly well that it was almost near perfection, yet fell a little short and incomplete. It needed that curve ball that tells you DAMN this is one hell of a beer. NO SHOCK VALUE  Will see if my opinion changes after a year in my cellar   Personal side note Will I buy it again? Of COURSE; Will I buy 3 bottles? NO (wish they served a 2-4oz taster on tap, smh); Will I join the reserve society to get a hold of this bottle? No",0.651493470227246,4.25,0.9817
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Really glad to have gotten some of this, so I figured I'd give a review a fair shot.  This beer is one of those barrel aged beers that doesn't try to do too much. It's barrel + stout and nothing else and it does an excellent job at it.  Bottled ten days ago and its a bit hoppier than I like my stouts, but nothing like the hoppiness of Yeti beers/variants. The barrel character really smooths out the taste. Closest cousin might be Dark Horse Barrel Aged Plead, but Plead is a tad sweeter, at least that's what my palette tells me today. It also could just be the bitterness masking it.  Mouth feel is great, not too thin or thick. Nose is fine. Wouldn't call it anything special. The best thing that I've done with this beer is let it warm. My first drink was at 50, and that was way too cold. Definitely needs to sit at room temp for a while.  If you are a big fan of the non adjunct/flavored format (I hesitate to say basic, because of the connotation) of big BA stouts, then this is a must try. However, if you prefer the cinnamon + bacon + coconut + coffee + vanilla + cat piss or one of the thousand other ridiculous things they put in beer these days, you may find yourself a bit underwhelmed considering what this beer is trading for.  Cheers!",0.5974132199182004,4.5,0.9817
Peche 'n Brett,"Best by 01/2020 (guess I'm a bit hasty)  Look - Pours a lovely, foggy burnt orange with a nice off white head. Good distribution, nice retention. Excellent clinging. 4.75 paws.  Smell - Holy moly, you can't put your nose within a foot of the glass without smelling the peaches and cream aromas. Once your in there it's all peach, like canned peaches in syrup, likely from the pear juice. So fresh and vibrant, wonderful. 5 paws.  Taste - The peaches are more subdued than on the nose, but are most definitely there. It finishes amazingly dry, a bit of a wonder they were able to retain so much peach flavor and aroma without making the beer cloyingly sweet. A bit of yogurt funk, bitter hop undertones, and lingering bitterness. Subtle peppery spice, pear comes through on the finish. 4.5 paws.  Feel - Medium to full bodied, slightly viscous and grainy. Little carbonation. 4.5 paws.  Overall - A tremendously enjoyable beer, I would be very curious to see how it ages. I'm sure the peach aroma would fade, but the brett more developed brett character could add many layers of complexity. 4.75 paws.",0.6826169625651158,4.75,0.9816
Beatification,"135th Review Bottle to snifter Vintage: Batch 2  From notes. I opened this bottle at bspringer's birthday celebration. An epic night for sure to celebrate his golden day of birth!  A: Bright sunshine. No head on medium pour - just a few bubbles.  S: Burnt hay, green apple, barnyard, funk, oak, lemon zest and hint of spice.  T: Beautiful balance of sour, tart, and sweet. Loads of funk up-front with a soft balance of citrus fruit and hay towards the back. Quite they dry finish, but simply perfect!  M: Light body with zero carbonation.  O: This beer is truly a work of art! So crisp, to-the-point, and just awesome. Definitely worth seeking out and making a point to try. I look forward to trying other batches at some point in the future and am stoked that Vinnie & Co. at Russian River are continuing to produce this beer.",0.6481294721011396,4.5,0.9816
Peche 'n Brett,"A — Pours an orangey hazy color into the glass, there is a puffy white head that settles out and leaves a spot or two of lacing behind.  S — Smells of fresh peaches and light funky brett. Really peach forward and fresh, just ridiculous how fresh and juicy this smells. This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a hazy burnt orange color with a one and a half finger big fluffy white head. After it finally dissipated (boy that took forever, almost like watching paint dry), light messy lacing stuck all around the glass. The smell started off with sweet juicy peaches. Funky brett plays a nice balance to lead into light tart citrus underneath. The taste was basically the same bringing in a nice sour element for added complexity. Subtle yeastiness shows its presence nicely. Semi-sweet to sour aftertaste runs into the finish. The mouthfeel was about light to medium bodied with a really nice crisp sweet sessionability about it. Carbonation feels good. Sour notes hit my tongue nicely. Overall, what a wonderful saison with the sour and tart feels in it. I'd have this again. This is top notch stuff here.",0.6843171179003826,4.75,0.9816

Chocolate Rain,"Reviewed from notes as JLindros and I split the bottle as part of our RS membership. Review #1000!  A - Holy shit!!! Thin mocha head atop a blackish brown hued pour. Outstanding with so much lovely legs!  S - TONS of chocolate and bourbon! Big, big vanilla comes through as it warms with nice light malt too. So much chocolate and bourbon. Like a Kentucky candy bar.  T - ¡¡¡¡¡¡ZZZOOOMMMGGG!!!!111 Liquid chocolate bars tempered with vanilla and bourbon. Rich, quality ingredients as well. Sweet zombie Jesus! So, so phenomenal with outstanding barrel notes, absurd amounts of silky chocolate. I really don't know how to put this into words. Its a silken chocolate gusher candy filled with bourbon and vanilla explosions. Unreal.  M - Mouthfeel is silk in my mouth. 19.5%...go F yourself! This can't be higher than 9%! I simply dont believe it, shanangins! Its thick and silky and almost coats the mouth. Its like a Geology field trip to Berkshire county all over again testing particle (grain) size on my tongue. Is this silt? Clay? No...its a colloid!!  O - This is a velour fog in my mouth covered in a velour bedspread, all of which is tucked into a too small velour uniform.

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"375mL bottle into a wine glass no bottling dates   Thanks to pearlstreetbrewingco for sending this one over in a trade.   A: Pours opaque black, small film of fizzy light mocha colored head that doesn’t cover the entire surface. Head dissipates very quickly, almost like a soda pop fizziness. Leaves only a few small patches of lacing. 4  S: Aroma is absolutely wonderful. Huge cinnamon and cocoa give it a big sweetness. Its got a graham cracker-esque and is a bit nutty. Subtle peppery heat. I got almost no bourbon barrel characters on the nose, but its still delectable. Killer aroma. 4.75  T: Taste is very good, but not nearly as fantastic as the aroma. The peppery heat is very big, I’ve had many of these highly rated cocoa/cinnamon/peppery stouts and this one is definitely amongst the hottest. I do think it detracts a bit from the other flavors. There not nearly the cinnamon and chocolate kick that the aroma implied, although there are semi-sweet cocoa and faint cinnamon notes on the finish. Some roasted characters as well. Again, bourbon barrel characters are barely noticeable. Its quite tasty, but a bit of a let down from the nose. 4.25   M/D: Mouthfeel is a bit harsh with the peppery heat and carbonation on the higher end for the style; its definitely got a bite to it. ABV is noticeable but its not bad. Drinkability is ok. 4  O: Very nice beer. Not amongst my favorite cocoa/cinnamon/peppery stouts, but quite a treat nonetheless, that I would happily enjoy any time. 4.25",0.6710783367672877,4.25,0.9815

Society & Solitude #4,"This review is a based on culmination of notes taken from when I had the beer fresh on draft (at Positive Pie) and from a three day old growler filled at Hill Farmstead Brewery.   A: Poured a deep golden color with an apricot-orange tinted hue with about a finger and a half of white head. The head receded into suds and a thick rim around the walls of the glass.   S: The aroma on the beer reveals hints of orange, grapefruit, and tangerines. The beer holds a very ""clean"" smell. One of the better smelling DIPAs I have head (reminds me of Abner).   T: This is what an IPA should taste like; bright sweet citrus quality engulfs my palate (notes of sweet orange and sugar sprinkled grapefruit) upfront. Out the back is mild sweetness that is over taking by a lingering bitterness.   M: Light/Soft carbonation and a medium mouthfeel.   O: A very well crafted IPA. The aroma is an excellent foreword to the taste. The taste is extremely balanced and full of flavor. On par, if not better than Abner (and I loved Abner).",0.6782319256557549,5.0,0.9815

Mastermind,"can. Dated 10/9/2014 at the bottom. Poured into a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass 10/21/2014. Should be better than it was the last time I had it, when it was about 6 weeks old..  A- Hazy golden-yellow body. Very opaque as typical of unfiltered IPAs. One finger fluffy white head, lots of lacing persists in rings. [4.25]  S- Resinous grapefruit, orange, even a bit of nectarine. A bit of sharp lime as well. Nice caramel malt backbone for a bit of balance. Very aromatic and strong. Can't put my finger on it, but it reminds me of one of Hill Farmstead's Society & Solitude beers. [4.5]  F- Sweet grapefruit and lime flavours mixed in with crackers and caramel. Some tangerine/orange in the finish. Very nice balance of aromatic hops, bittering hops and the malt backbone. [4.5]  M- Medium bodied, soft and nicely carbonated. A bit thinner than the other big names in Vermont, but that's not saying a whole lot. Very smooth, drinkable and soft feel. [4.25]  O- Very good DIPA, especially this fresh. Would highly recommend asking for this one as an addition to your next big hop box from Vermont. [4.5]  Final score: 4.46",0.7065257613853297,4.5,0.9814
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Courtesy of a generous trader served at a small tasting by an equally generous host into a tulip glass. This review is for the 2010 batch.  A: Pours nearly black with a motor oil quality with no head to speak of. This is a thick beer that looks quite syrupy and leaves nice legs on the inside of the glass. This was served along with Vanilla Bean Dark Lord and both looked pretty much identical.  S: The oak is really showcased in this and it is really nicely done. Notes of chocolate, molasses, roasted malts, vanilla, and booze.  T: The oak yet again is quite forward and coats the based beer beautifully and is never overpowering. Chocolate appears along with roasted malts, vanilla, and just a hint of alcohol.   M: Full-bodied and extremely thick with just a hint of carbonation. Nothing to complain about here.  D: If it weren't for the extreme richness of this Imperial Stout, I feel that I could drink this all day long.  Overall I must say that beer is absolutely fantastic and I am still shocked that I was able to try this! My Highest Recommendation.",0.6720667295475223,4.0,0.9814
Black Tuesday,"2014 version. Poured into a brandy style snifter.   Pours fairly black with brownish edges when held to the light, fat tan head that sticks around for a few sips with no lacing, but amazing legs like you would find with a fine wine. Aroma is vinous - cabernet, barrel, dark fruit, bakers chocolate, vanilla, coconut - almost like a German chocolate cake soaked in bourbon - phenomenal! Aroma carries over into flavor - very wine-like, a lot going on but all in perfect harmony.......tons of bourbon, but not over the top. This beer is hot, make no doubt about it, but at nearly 20% it's to be expected - the sweetness of the stout works so well with the booziness in this one - again, such a great balance, medium bodied with a dry finish.",0.6509248671203169,4.75,0.9814
Juicy,"Poured from the bottle into a Hill Farmstead stemware glass. Gushes a bit on opening  Milky white top, classic HF milky and tight bubbles make the pour and cap. Always leaves a nice 2-3mm puck. Body color is a dull peach orange, and opaque quite hazy.  Bouquet hits hot and sharp. Big brett funk, mixing with large aromatic peaches and fruit. Mellows out with a nice to aptly described heat and tropical juicy fruit action. Lots of pineapple, and yellow tropic sensations. More of a punch tropic than an actual beer, just that hint of classic big funk brings you back. Smells amazing. A few drops spill on my hands, and my fingers smell like liquid bread, just incredible.  What an impressive palate. Fruit punch action, and tropical pineapple abounds. Huge juice finish with large peppery sensing spice. Bread and toasty sourdough explode in the aftertaste all over. A good controlled burst of heat, but nothing boozy. Incredibly.. truly.. juicy palate, mouth coating and full, but light and not thick. Lemon, pineapples, peaches oh my.. throw in some farmhouse big bold goodness and it's mouthwatering.  I am not one for tropical notes, I am even less one of a fan for pineapple flavors, but this is just unreal. Borderline blurring drink. Great saison, great Hill Farmstead stuff. Stupidly drinkable...

Schaerbeekse Kriek,"750ml $16.99 Sam's Marcey  Bottled 3/22/06  Drie Fonteinen's Schaerbeekse Kriek pours the color of cherry juice with a murkiness that's impossible to see through. A fizzy pink head violently formed with snap, crackle, and pops and ended up quickly fizzles out to no head at all. The color of this kriek is superbly rich looking and there are a few streams of slow moving carbonation creeping to the surface.  Each time my beak enters the glass the tartness makes my nose hair curl. The cherries are noticeable in the background and are fairly faint. Dusty wildflower like funkiness adds to the noticeable sourness and a firm, balanced layer of dry, brittle woodiness (oak) forms a solid foundation. With a little warming and a swirl the dark cherries leap from the bottle.  Ahhh, a nice cheek puckering sourness starts things off and pushes all the way through the flavor. There's a great acidity as it rolls over the tongue with notes of the dry woodiness throughout. The cherries bob and weave which adds a great compliment instead of taking over. The finish is bone dry and allows the sourness to linger. As this warms the cherries added really come into their own. This is an excellent kriek.  There's a lively carbonation that's prickly on the tongue but the body still somehow has a creamy texture, as creamy as it can be for as light a bodied brew as this is. The dryness is intense and makes this brew infinitely interesting.  The drinkability is out of this world easy. The puckering ability and dryness make sip after sip needed. As soon as I swallow one drink I need another. This lambic is so frizzy and refreshing it's a sheer joy to drink.  I can't recommend this lambic enough and it's actually one I pick up fairly often, for a lambic anyway. This is my favorite kriek and I really can't get enough of drinking this stuff.

Beatification,"Bottle (2008/Batch 003)  Thanks for opening this with me, schmoopsbeer!  (Aged for 3+ years)  Hazy golden and yellow with orange highlights and a pillowy, finger and a half high, nearly white head, that leaves the glass messy with sheets of lace.  The aroma is far more funky than I would have presumed along with with huge amounts of sour acidity rushing up from the glass as well. The funk comes in waves of barnyard, hay, and leather, while the sourness has strong apple, pear, and lemon accents. Strong, aggressive, and fantastic aroma. The Brett and the sourness combine incredibly well.  The flavor is just as amazing and even more complex, with the Brett, barnyard, horse blanket, hay notes coming through very strongly, right alongside the big, tart lemon sourness making one's jowls quiver. Complete, funky, sour, delicious, drinkable--all words I'd use to describe this bottle.  Medium bodied with high carbonation. A treat to drink.

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"4 ozish pour in a plastic cup at Brickskeller 3F tasting. I interpreted this to be the 2010 release of the 2009 DL aged in whiskey barrels, not the 2009 Oak Aged Dark Lord. Either way...  Pours an extremely sludgy, viscous syrup like dark brown, near black with a non-existent head and no signs of carbonation. So yea, appearance is pretty much as expected for style, but nothing exciting. Aroma is hot and abrasive, assaulting you while the glass is still on the table. Immediately hits you with bourbon and oak. After letting acclimating to the booze and burn, other notes from the base DL are apparent, including chocolate, coffee and more oak. Very sweet, raw and complex aroma. Mouthfeel is very thick and chewy, silky and long lasting on the palate, near perfect. Flavors follow similar pattern to the nose; overall extremely sweet and it takes a moment to get past the oak and bourbon to pick out the subtleties of the original dark lord, and it that its primarily chocolatey. This isn't a 13% ABV beer that you can said hides its alcohol well either as there is a noticeable burn associated with each sip. This was an unexpected to treat to try, but overall I was left feeling like this in an instance of an amazing beer + more amazingness (barrel aging) != doubly amazingness. Overall some of the complexity is sapped out of this by the dominance of the boozy and oak flavors.",0.6690234755922361,3.5,0.9813
Mastermind,"Look: A hazy golden straw with burst of orange through out. Reminds me of Nelson from alpine.   Smell: Smacks you in the face with huge pineapple, peach, apricot, and green apple. Everytime I smell it a different vibrant fruit note smacks my nostrils! After the bright citrus come a slight malt and a ting of booze to show the big body. I could spray my whole house with a febreeze made with this!   Taste: Big vibrant peach and pineapple notes on the attack followed by a touch of piney hops, with another burst of peach that lingers as the malted body creeps forward then a bitter hop shows with a slight booze. More fruity hops on the finish. Fantastic.  Mouthfeel: Bright and vibrant at first then the bitter hop brings about a medium body with a slight booze heat. Solid representation of the style.   Overall: Another fantastic Vermont DIPA. It doesn't quite hit heady but it's definitely not one to miss while on Vermont! A great beer that is sadly over shadowed that you don't have to give your first born to obtain. I simply walked into a local grocery store and they had a case.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Backlog:  Look: Poured incredibly heavy, and had a certain weight to it as it filled my tasting snifter. Minimal head, jet black.  Smell: Like nothing I had ever smelt before: intense roasted coffee with just a hint of pepper, dark chocolate, and nuances of maple. Oh yeah, and BOURBON. Really complex. Taste: Tons of coffee on the tongue, with (what I consider) a perfect carb that just tickles the tongue. Lingering sweetness after the drink, then the amazing bourbon aftertaste that leaves you wanting more.  Feel: Incredibly coating, almost oily. The taste lingered and developed for about 15 seconds after a sip. Once again, a fantastic carb on this one.  Overall: Easily one of the best beers I've ever had the pleasure of trying.

Having gotten accustomed to beer of this ilk being a somewhat cloudy orange, I was surprised as how clear and pale it was, more yellow than anything else. But the taste put aside any fears of this being a lightweight. It was awesome, following the nose but going beyond that.

Just rounded acidity that plays off the raspberry flavour and aroma. Interesting lemon note. Low barnyard flavours but the fruitiness really makes this a winner.  Medium-light body with moderately-high carbonation. Super.  An excellent beer in the finest Cantillon style. The Lou Pepe range truly is the pinnacle of what they produce.

Taste - Lot of fruit and licorice up front on this one. Chocolate isn't as pronounced as it was on the nose, instead I pick up a lot of caramel with a hint of vanilla.  Feel - Mouthfeel is nice. I was expecting it to be a bit thin base on the pour and color as it came out of the bottle. Smooth on the mouthfeel and just enough there to allow you to mull it over a bit. Would love it to be thicker, but nice where it's at.  Overall: Nice BA stout. Can tell the booze is there compared to some other high abv stouts, but it is well done.

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"On tap at Dark Lord Day 2007-- appearance is slightly damaged by the plastic cup, but I'll try not to hold that against the beer.  The appearance is basically an imperial stout with the knobs turned up to eleven, a mixture of equal parts espresso, roof tar, and castor oil. The head is a dark brown whisp that still manages to leave a little lace on the plastic cup. Bubbles are otherwise nonexistent.  The aroma is coffee, probably the best coffee I've ever smelled in a beer. All the usual suspects are there, too: bourbon, vanilla, maple syrup, molasses, dark malts, oak (wood, really, I don't know if oak smells different from any other wood), and alcohol.   The taste opens up light with just a little maltiness, folllowed by a swell of coffee and dark malts. Coffee flavor grows continuously to the finish, while maple syrup, vanilla, and woody flavors come in. Maple syrup flavor is stronger the taste than in the aroma. Everything in the nose shows up in the flavor profile, with wood, boubon, and alcohol coming in last. The finish lasts for at least a decade. What I can't believe (and contrary to everything I've been told) is how balanced this is. The beer really handles the coffee beans, the bourbon barrels, and the stupidly high alcohol content unbelievably well, with a flavor profile that's complex instead of overwhelming.   The mouthfeel is super-thick and viscous, chewy and oily. A little hot (it is 13% ABV after all), but not at all out of control-- pretty much what I'd expect when I wanted a bourbon-aged imperial stout. Carbonation is totally absent and I like it that way.  Drinkable for a 13%ABV oak-aged imperial stout with coffee beans added to it, which is to say, no, for the love of God, don't try drinking twenty of them.  As far as imps are concerned, I think this is about as good as it gets.",0.6559956725078606,3.5,0.9812
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Bottle enjoyed at the Brasserie after an enlightening and exciting self-tour my first full day in Belgium, served in the traditional wicker basket into Cantillon tumbler.   Rose colored head, very small bubbles, you can *hear* the dissipation on this champagne like beer. Interesting raspberry aroma, not a big fruity nose, but rather delicate, masks the funky horseblanket notes from this 2010 vintage. Taste is certainly on the tart not sour side, pronounced yet not heavy berry notes, enough funk to keep your interest, nice balance with the raspberries. Mouthfeel on the light side, delicate, huge effervescent mouthfeel. Wow. Beer of the Gods. The exemplar of the style.",0.6846514880736971,4.5,0.9812
Society & Solitude #4,"Pours a nice, frothy snow-white head. Retention is good, and very nice long lines of lacing persist. Brew is a pulpy, almost completely opaque light orange color.  Peppery hop notes first greet my nose (similar to NZ hop varietals), carrying tropical and light citrus notes as well. There is a sweet but understated malt presence; very much there, but not allowing itself to upstage the hops.  Flavor indeed follows the nose: very soft and subtle tropical fruits, peppery spice, and a long, muted citrus peel finish. Just a tiny hint of dankness at the end. Malt balance throughout is soft, creamy, and superb; very light biscuit and bread. Brew is intensely bitter, but incredibly approachable despite.  Long, long finish; very lively, with no sting; minimal foaming; juicy. I think medium is right about on for feel, with a huge, juicy, sticky lingering finish. The bitterness really cleanses your mouth on the finish, leaving you begging the next sip. Absolutely no hint of alcohol.  This reminds me of all the rare, sought-after new-hop-varietal big DIPAs made on the West coast, but with the soft, creamy mouthfeel that, to me, makes HF special. Fruity and peppery hops are showcased, somehow both bold and upfront, yet subtle and balanced with the malts.  Yet another superb beer. My favorite S&S? I'm thinking no, but absolutely delicious, nonetheless.",0.7246188094684635,4.5,0.9811
Nelson,Green Flash bottle best by 21 Mar 2016  A: poured into an IPA glass to a hazed light orange with a dense one finger tan head that retains well and leaves great lacing  S: smells extremely dank with notes of resinous hops with some citrusy notes and rye spice with some malt sweetness T: taste is grapefruit and resinous pine with some light tropical fruit and grapefruit rind with some light caramel sweetness and spicy rye. Swallow is a nice blast of oily citrusy hops and grapefruit juice with some lingering spice M: medium in body with soft and slightly prickly carbonation and a huge oily fiinish from the hops O: Dank and resinous West Coast goodness in a bottle. Probably a benchmark for the style and easily one of the best I've ever had. If you see this and like IPAs you need to buy it.,0.662202325495899,4.75,0.9811
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"12/23/11 bottle date. Ten year expiry. Poured from a 750mL bottle into a 3F fountain tumbler glass at t brug beertje.  Pours a maroon hazy body with a pink head that reduces moderate rate to leave a ring of retention.  Aromas are heavy cherry and lots of funk - cherry jam and old basement, sharp lactic. Just fantastic.  Taste is heavy on the cherries with a very balanced tartness, oak, yeast, funk, with a dry but flavorful berry follow through, finishing tart and fruity with light oak. Mouthfeel is medium with low carbonation and rich cherries.  Just fantastic- great for those who love heavy cherry flavor with a good amount of tartness and funk.",0.6735148951383584,4.5,0.9811
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Vintage 2008.  Appearance: Pours a clear ruby color with tons of pink head. Probably 6"" of head forms after a 1oz pour, that has incredible retention. Very high carbonation in this bottle.  Smell: Smells of slightly sweet, but mostly sour and tart raspberries. Some bretty funk, sharp grass scents, mustiness, and oak follows.   Taste: Sour raspberries and lemony tartness up front, followed by funk, mustiness, and general sourness. Very oaky as well. A hint of sweetness to offset, but mostly just sour.  Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied with very high carbonation, great mouthfeel and spot on for the style. Overall, a great fruit beer. Very sour all in all, but complex at the same time. Will definitely look to get ahold of another bottle of this.",0.6901844338827169,4.5,0.9811
Swish,"A – 16 oz. can poured into a tulip. Typical BB style - very, very hazy giving an appearance of pineapple juice. Don’t be turned off…there’s much more to this beer than the look. Slight head upon pour which sags. Minor lacing. S – Citrus, pineapple, mango notes. Slight pine, but not as much as the fruit tones. Same with the malt; very little. T – Tropical fruits galore – tangerine, grapefruit, mango and pineapple. The pine comes through next, doesn’t overshadow, but definitely balances the fruits. Not much bitterness – just a well-balanced finish. Certainly doesn’t taste like an 8%. M – Low carbonation, but it works. Very creamy feeling with a dry finish. O – Classically great DIPA from BB that’s easy to drink. Sip after sip, this beer just keeps getting better.",0.6720554679276519,4.75,0.9811
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2010 LP Framboise - Poured from a 750ml bottle  A: Deep pink/red with a light pink head  S: Some dry tart funk and jammy berries, a little bit of yeast  T: I'm tasting 2 very different and pronounced components of this beer both separately and at once. On one hand, you can taste all the qualities of a delicious Cantillon labmic - funky barnyard, grass, with a pretty heavy sourness. One the other hand you can taste super fresh raspberries, maybe the most natural raspberry flavor I've ever encountered in a beer. Together they are phenomenal.  M: Slightly dry, good carb  O: I was very very impressed by this beer! Really fantastic framboise from Cantillon.",0.6667569368010954,4.75,0.981
Sip Of Sunshine,"Package date 2/7/18, received today courtesy of my brother-in-law. Poured into a snifter glass.   Beautiful looking beer, surprisingly clear, color of peach and apricot. Smell of tropical and citrus fruit, not overpowering.   Taste is remarkable - citrus immediately noticeable up front (tangerine), quickly followed by a welcome level of bitterness, with lovely carbonation tickling the tongue throughout the taste and finish.   Great mouthfeel and finish, with the carbonation lingering as the bitterness slowly fades away. Very good lacing is a plus.   Wow!",0.6758420177739116,4.5,0.981
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"A fruit beer executed to near perfection. With the taste of raspberry locked intact, the supporting ale celebrates the berry's bright flavor, its zesty acidity, and its crisp and refreshing taste in ideal fashion; and does so without backing down either.  Delightfully mauve-pink in color, the lightly carbonated ale carries a vibrant tawny appearance and simply glistens in the glass. The bright acidity of raspberry, rose wine, cork and burlap offers the nose a racy fruit scent that's contrasted by equal parts earth and rusticity.  As the beer hits the tongue, the palate is taken back by the beer's acute acidity that plays out above the modest lingering sweetness of fructose and wafer-thin malt. Slim on hops, the slight malt starch supports the beer's impressive sourness and its delicate brine without much interference in taste. Without being overly vinegar, or of lime, or of barnyard funk or game, the sourness is potent but elegant and refined.  Its light body is both softened with carbonation but is also given a sprite effervescent that springs from the tongue like brut champagne. Acidity strips the thirst from the palate and ushers in a high rate of refreshment and drinkability that outweighs its intense raspberry sourness. With an afterglow of fruit, wheat, cork and white pepper.",0.7179700700209923,4.5,0.981
Beatification,"Served from bottle into a snifter glass. The bottle was bought at RR, and I had a bottle while there, but I am currently drinking it at home.  A: A slightly hazy (but not completely opaque) yellow/golden. Light sediment on the bottom.  S: Sharp oakiness, vanilla, sourness. Maybe grapes, as well.  T: Lots of oak and vanilla, and very sour. Apricots and floral notes, definitely grapes. Very delicious. The fruity and floral flavors, especially, come out after the beer warms up above cellar temperature. Very clean finish, with no lingering aftertaste (except maybe a certain subtle and pleasant one).  M: Low on carbonation, but very acidic / sour.  O: An excellent beer. Almost as good as American sour beers get. However, at the price point (even directly from RR, which only offers 375 mL bottles), it's not worth quite the hype that it gets. Just keep in mind that - if you can find them - Cantillon and 3F gueuzes are actually cheaper per volume. Heck, a Cuvee Renee is 1/3 the price and is comparable quality (though some may disagree)! If you get the chance, try this beer. Just don't lose an arm and a leg for it. It is not a spiritual experience.",0.6636341735794865,5.0,0.981
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"4/28/2010 vintage 750ml into an over sized wine glass. Allowed to warm up to room temperature.   A - Deep red body, very clear and juice like. I gave it an aggressive pour for the second glass and I got an off white/light pink head that fizzled away in seconds. Pouring the swirled dregs yields a cloudy dark pink/red liquid that looks like a raspberry smoothie.   S - Sweet cherries followed by some brett funk. The cherry is very potent but sweet with hints of vanilla and cinnamon. Just very light and faint spices. The finish is oaky and sour.  T - Sour cherries followed by oak and brett funk. Very smooth and refreshing flavor. I can pick out some of that vanilla and cinnamon. Some lemony lactic action going as well. Tart and crisp carbonation.   O - A fantastic kriek. It has a lot of complex sweetness to balance out the sour and tart flavors. I enjoyed it much more than the standard oude kriek, but the price tag is really difficult to swallow. Still glad I grabbed a bottle though.",0.6729477217001851,4.5,0.981
Enjoy By IPA,"Rating 7/4/16  I used to love these, but they have really gone downhill, with 10/31/14 being the last amazing one.  This one comes off as all over the place, when i think the aim was ""complex"". It is very hoppy, very layered...good enough mouthfeel. Little boozy. Little chewy. I think in 2016 this is only a slightly above average double ipa. I do appreciate this release, and happy stone continues to do it. They are never ""bad"" and always interesting. Im just not sure it needs 27 hops   Edit- i noticed someone else said better from bottle than poured, i agree. My grade from bottle would be solid 4/5",0.6245565197673362,3.75,0.9809

Nelson,"Pours a hazy golden color with a 2 finger width foamy head. Head retention is very good. Lacing is excellent. Has a nice, fresh, juicy citrus aroma with some piney resin at the end. I wish there was cologne that smells like this! Taste is a big, juicy citrus bomb. Nice piney resin at the end. Moderate astringency. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. So glad this beer came to Texas and hope we get it in a 6 pack soon. This is great!!",0.6584549776640188,4.75,0.9809
Society & Solitude #4,"On-draught @ Torst in Brooklyn at $13 per 14oz pour.  APPEARANCE: Frothy off-white creamy head atop a hazy orange body. Retention is good - about 10 minutes. 3-4cm of head. Leaves nice even coating on the sides of the glass as it recedes.  AROMA: Resinous and floral, with blossoming citrus. Pale malts even out the hops.   Average aromatic intensity.  TASTE: Bends a bit into the new world hop tropical camp, evoking orange creamsicle, tangerine zest, and even a bit of pineapple - not a flavour I'm a fan of in a beer. The mango and papaya are nice. Resinous and floral enough to satisfy, but the prominent tropical fruit flavour isn't really up my alley.   Slightly imbalanced, but the pale malts do a good job fighting the hop bitterness. I'm not dazzled by the hop profile, but it's nice enough.  TEXTURE: Slightly scratchy and dry in the third act and finish, but otherwise smooth and wet for the most part. A bit overcarbonated. No booziness or heat here.  OVERALL: Not a dazzling imperial IPA like its reputation suggests (I hoped for more flavour), but certainly an enjoyable one. I wouldn't buy it again at this price, but I'm glad I got to try it. Drinkability is on par with the ABV.  Low B (3.55) / GOOD",0.6862249741657717,3.25,0.9808
Aaron,"2014 bottle - thanks Eric for the opportunity. L: Dark walnut, red mahogany, and espresso hues with a thin 2mm sandy head with ample retention S: Raisins, figs, and a subtle hint of the barrel T: Chewy, thick oatmeal raisin cookies with a slight cinnamon and vanilla flavor and holiday spices that is embraced and enhanced with a pronounced bourbon finish...incredibly complex range from start to finish F: Medium viscosity and low carbonation  O: Absolutely delicious barleywine from my first pour to my last. The barrel aging adds a nice complementary note to a flavorful and complex base beer. While this has had approximately two years of aging there was still a little heat on it, but that didn't detract from the flavor profile at all. Very enjoyable and ranks up there with Great, MOAS, Sucaba and ADWTD in my opinion as one of the best barleywines in the country. Lastly, if Jeffo and Alieniloquium, two of the notoriously toughest raters of top beers I've seen, gave this a >4.4 rating - you know it has to be the real deal. Based on HF's tweet that the next batch was going into barrels in April 2015, I'll definitely be on the lookout for this one again!",0.6883287130333556,4.75,0.9808
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"A: Tapped into a small goblet; red in color, hardly any head  S: Very fruity, identifiably raspberry, some malt  T: Highly acidic, sour and tart, delicious. This is an excellent lambic style beer that starts tart and fruity, goes to sour, and is dry in the finish. No sweetness in the profile at all.  M: Low carbonation, but this was probably the result of our pour coming from the last in the keg. It's quite persistent and refreshing. A lovely beer.  D: A highly drinkable beer, if you can find it. Great to share.  We had this beer at the bar in Binny's - South Loop, Chicago. As noted, it was the last of the keg, but it was still excellent.",0.6745106282165341,4.5,0.9808
Aaron,"So wow, honestly one the finest BA Barleywines I have every had.... Poured into a 13 oz Game Of Thrones Glass aged for 2 years in bourbon barrels bottled in the last two months. Pours a gorgeous chestnut with a 2 plus finger off white head that leaves a few thin wisps of lace. 4.75  Smell starts with Oaked woody bourbon, chestnut, vanilla, toffee, caramel, dates, hard cider, and a little more booze that tickles and warms the nose. 4.5  Taste follows bold vanilla bourbon, caramel, toffee, dark fruit, nutty, biscuity grain, and again the warming booze shows up and warms me belly! 4.5  Mouthfeel is rather large, creamy with gentle carbonation, slightly dry in the finish, and I assume this is around 11.5 or 12% ABV, but the bottle doesn’t list, dipper for sure but because of its complexity pretty easy sipping. 4.5  Overall one of if not the greatest BA Barleywine I have had the pleasure of drinking, wowza and cheers! 4.5",0.6243494969363936,4.5,0.9808
Enjoy By IPA,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Mostly clear golden-orange body with excellent two finger-thick head retention and lacing. Head is foamy, sudsy, gorgeous tan.  Aroma is very dank and fluorescent. Pine, honey, and graham cracker, along with other malts, are most of the smell. Other notes of guava, mango, grapefruit, and other citrus.  Piney hops, sweet honey, citrus juice, and grapefruit dominate the palette. Much like the aroma, although I taste papaya and pineapple as well. The hops are bitter and firm, yet the malty sweetness also competes for the front. Graham cracker provides and acts as a medium. Finely balanced. Heavenly and pillowy smoothness in the mouth.   Great beer.",0.6758262280379776,4.5,0.9808
Blanc De Blancs,"A- Pours a bright, medium straw golden in color. A small, one finger head forms and dissipates quickly down to a trace of bubbles around the edges of the glass. The body of the beer is nearly entirely clear. The lacing is minimal with the lack of a prominent head.  S- Starts off with a mild to somewhat assertive white grape fruitiness on the nose. Just a touch of crisp tartness is present in the scent, but the chardonels really shine through here. The scent displays a little bit of grapey sweetness, but not a whole lot. My overall impression of the smell is that of a slightly tart, off-dry chardonel, that has just a touch of funky dryness at the very end.  T- Starts off by assaulting the tongue with fairly aggressive punch of juicy sour flavor. The grape fruit flavors take a back seat to the overall sour flavor, although the tartness is derived out of the fruit. In the middle of the drink, the sourness becomes somewhat acidic and very reminiscent of a War Heads candy. After the peak of the sour flavor, a touch of funkiness creeps in and gives more of a grainy flavor underneath the tartness. Dryness from the barrel is detectable at the end of the drink, although the prominent flavor is still juicy and somewhat fruity tartness.  M- This beer is very true to the style and feels pretty much like a champagne. The only difference between a champagne and this beer is the perceived level of thickness because this beer feels fairly thick on the tongue. This is more of a sipper due to the harsh sour flavors in the taste profile.  Overall, this was way different than I expected. I was expecting more of a wine-like drinking experience given the name, ingredients, and style. With that being said, this is still a tremendous beer. If you are a sour fan, this offers a great, juicy sourness in addition to some great complexity from the yeast and barrel aging.",0.7135383098759371,4.5,0.9808
Sip Of Sunshine,"A pint can dated 02/06/17 received in a generous box of beer sent by BA jhavs. I'm pouring it in a 13oz. tulip for the review.   Look- Pours a transparent radiant brass color leaving a thick finger of creamy white foam that slowly settles revealing moderate lacing.   Smell- Grapefruit, pine, mild passion fruit and spicy floral esters. A hint of butyl and cheesy yeast is hiding in the back.   Taste- Dank and weedy with grapefruit, passion fruit, pine, fresh rubber and spicy floral notes.   Feel- Resiny thick but very crisp and clean with a bitter dry finish.   Overall- Giant fruity/floral hop smell and taste in a great looking, easy drinking 8% beer. And it's not hazy! This is some seriously great nectar that is appropriately named.

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Bottle (2012)  Thanks for opening this with me, MarkIntihar!  Nearly black, though very heavy and substantial looking in the glass. Shiny and oily, with a small brown head that leaves dots of stick.  Rich, inviting, monstrous aroma of bourbon (vanilla, oak, maple, alcohol hint), chocolates, and roast. This combines marvelously well. As this warms, there's just a hint of an off vegetable-like note, but it's certainly not distracting, especially because it tastes so good.  Any flaw found in the aroma is completley hidden in the flavor. Rich, layered notes of vanilla, bourbon barrel, molasses, chocolates, and roast combine for an incredilby drinkable, though incredibly significant, substantial barrel-aged RIS.  Full in body, thick, heavy, luscious.  One of the finest beers I've had.",0.6882197227075706,5.0,0.9808
Coconut B-Bomb,"Cut the bottle in half with an ancient, jewel encrusted katana with a diamond-tipped blade and then sipped slowly, cautiously, dangerously from the sheared glass.  That’s how unreal this beer is - I should’ve drank it like this. Instead I probably disrespected its greatness by pouring it into a conventional wine glass and drinking it like a peon.  Black pour with a thin cardboard-colored head that frothed then faded away. Light swirl left on the surface.  I was ready for a coconut-punch-in-the-face aroma but what I found instead was a blend of roasted malt, dark rich chocolate, char, booze, oak and toasted coconut. The coconut is strong but not overpowering; it actually complements the barrel-aged flavor incredibly well.  Taste is right there with the aroma with an added touch of molasses and light vanilla thrown into the mix. The coconut just lingers in the palate creating a semi-seeet finish that complements the heavy stout beneath.  Thick, viscous and so smooth. An indulgent treat in every way without coming across as liquid pastry or manufactured. Amazing brew.",0.6717801711383949,4.5,0.9808
Sure Bet,"22 oz. bottle, with Batch #573 - 574 printed on the label. The latest DIPA creation from the masters at Pipeworks; expectations are ridiculous for this one considering it's current high ratings.   Poured into a Duvel tulip glass.  A - It pours a deliciously murky, juicy, golden orange body with two fingers of soapy frothy white head with excellent staying power for the high abv. This beer seriously looks like a nice glass of juice, or a beer with juice added to it. Lots of thin spotty lacing. Looks excellent, if there was ever an IPA to earn a 5 for appearance, this one is it.  S - The aroma follows in the footsteps of many other Pipeworks DIPA's, but this one might be just a tad bit juicier than usual. This thing literally reeks of tropical mango puree, oranges, pineapples, grapefruits, & pine. About as fresh, juicy, & fruity as you can get it.  T - Taste follows the nose with loads of hop bitterness - grapefruit, orange, pineapple, pine, and tons and tons of authentic tropical mango puree. As with the nose, the honey is noticeable, but it fades more into the malt profile.  M - The feel is fruity, juicy, & bitter. Medium bodied with excellent carbonation. This thing is literally as easy-drinking as a glass of juice. Extremely piney & bitter finish. Mildly warming alcohol presence, but at 9.50% abv, the alcohol is extremely well masked.  Overall, this is by far one of the best DIPA's that Pipeworks has ever produced, and that is coming out of a line-up of literally hundreds of excellent beers. Keep up the good work, guys.

Peche 'n Brett,"Pours a cloudy kind of peach colored mixture with yellow beer. Nice 3/4"" white head. Aroma was delicious and as advertised: peach and brett! Phenomenal head retention.   Taste, wow, nice and light bodied, yet delivering a substantial amount of brett dryness, funk, oak and peaches. Easy to see why this is so appreciated. Alternates between creamy peach and dry saison body mouthfeel.   How does it hide that big abv? Amazingly done. Everything blends together well without any aspect dominating. Does everything well, carbonation spot on. I wish I had more, would bang again, and probably buy every time I saw it. Got this one at Belmont Station.",0.6817087307285071,4.5,0.9807

The smell is extremely enticing.  The taste is an explosion of orange citrus and pungent pine hops. An amazing tasting brew for sure. I wish I could have had this straight from the tap.  Medium bodied with a perfect amount of carbonation. Very easy drinking if you can handle hop bombs. Drying citrusy pine aftertaste.  Overall, this is a top notch IPA. Can't thank jlindros enough for the trade. The perfect brew for IPA day without a doubt.",0.6650621630312801,4.5,0.9807
Thicket,"Pours a light reddish brown body with slight pink hues, half finger white head with surprisingly good retention time, nice lacing. Smells of tart lactic acidity, blackberry puree. Mild grainy malt sweetness in the background, but make no mistake, the acidity and the blackberry are the stars here. Although, the blackberry is certainly playing second fiddle to the lacto and acetic acid. Flavour is surprisingly less sour than expected, e.g. La Fosse, and the blackberries kick in towards the end. For the most part, it's oak, a bit of hay, a lot of lactic and acetic acid contributing a strong sense of sourness. The blackberries start to come into their own halfway in, and leave you with a mild jammy flavour at the end. The tartness never recedes but is rather constant. Still, it's a tasty beer and is far easier to drink than La Fosse. Overall, a very nice blackberry wild, but it lacks a good bit of complexity for the most part. It's acidic with a moderate blackberry presence, that's pretty much all she wrote.",0.6790962946329605,4.25,0.9807
Todd The Axe Man,"This beer has been on my 'bucketlist' for quite some time. Finally distributing out to CO. Look - great amount of thick dense white foam. The head sticks around for a bit, but quickly reduces down to a thin ring of bubbles around the outside of the glass.  Smell - quite a bit of pine and some sweet mango / slight orange Taste - only a slight amount of pine but the mango orange really blasts in. Not very bitter up front - sweetens up nicely during the fruity outburst, but then dries out considerably towards the end. I'm left with some slightly woodsy/charred wood aftertaste Feel - decent medium body. Flattens halfway through and uninteresting on the tongue. Overall - VERY GOOD IPA. I have had a lot of IPAs lately that were just MEH. This is above and beyond the typical IPA. Highly recommend this one. Glad I finally picked up some Surly. Now on to the other 3 that get distributed out here.",0.6605095659132051,4.75,0.9806
Green,"Smell: Melon, mandarin oranges, pineapple, mango, bubblegum, a hint of malt, super juicy. It smells amazing!  Taste: Follows the nose upfront it's a tropical juice explosion melon, pineapple, nectarine. In the mid plate you get mango, orange, tangerine, a hint of crackery malt, juicy fruit bubblegum. In the finish you get a moderate grapefruit bitterness. It balances it out a bit but this is a Juice Bomb!  Feel: Medium full body, extremely creamy, soft and pillowy on the tongue. It's an amazing mouthfeel.  Overall: Out of all the treehouse I've had this is the best. Super juicy and creamy. It's really amazing. If you like juice bombs you need to get treehouse.

Fudge, coconut, caramel, molasses, stone fruit, vanilla, and big, fusile alcohol.   M. Very boozy and very sweet which is the only complaint here. Rich and decadent.   O. Worthy of the hype.

Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Bottled 28-04-2010  A: Pours a beautiful sunset red-orange with no head to speak of. Not even bubbles coat the top  S: Funk, tart cherries, oak, and yeast all mingle together to make quite an impressive smell for a sour fruit lambic  T: The barnyard funk hits first, but is quickly overtaken by notes of oak and tart cherries. Neither slam hard, but together make an amazing, slightly complex beer. No sweetness present to balance the sour out, but it isn't really necessary as the oak and cherries do the job  M: Light-medium body with moderate carbonation  O: The only thing I can seriously slam this on is the price tag, although the style can vaguely justify it. This beer does an amazing job balancing everything out, especially considering there isn't really that sweetness that you get in some lambics. Definitely seek this out if you can afford it",0.6726285172870501,4.5,0.9805
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Handbottle shared graciously by Chris. It was MUCH better than I remember it being when I tried it at DLD 08  Jet black, no head with dark brown highlights. Not as sludgy as the regular Dark Lord. A solid looking beer. Holy fucking fuck, what a nose! Chocolate chip cookies with bourbon come right to mind. Just massive, intensely good. A ton of vanilla with a relatively low booze character, with bourbon noticeable. Not hot in the least, the vanilla character is actually quite tastefully done. Mildly raisiny with cocoa powder and chocolate fudge. Just over the top. The palate isn't as exceptional, but opens with all the fantastic chocolate complexity with cocoa, dark chocolate and fudge. Plenty sweet with caramel, burnt sugar and an incredible accent of bourbon. The oak aging is most noticeable in the vanilla character of this beer, along with a mildly boozy character. Coffee isn't noticeable, though there's enough molasses and licorice to make an effort at countering the chocolate character. Mild dark fruit character is present with raisins soaked in sugar syrup. An incredibly long finish with a bit of booze, a lot of vanilla, mild roast and some chocolate. Thick and HUGE, this big beer has low carbonation and has a perfect body. My belief is reaffirmed, and I'm almost tempted to go to DLD next year and session this and the VB DL. Awesome stuff.",0.652618538361442,4.5,0.9805
Mastermind,"Poured a beautifully bright and only slightly cloudy yellow with a full head of nice white foam. Aromas and flavors are bursting with pineapple qualities: it truly tastes like biting into a fresh, sweet tropical pineapple while on the beach of an island paradise. For a beer that doesn't have any added fruits or juices, this is the most pineapple flavor I've ever encountered in a brew; it's not cloying or too sweet though. There's some bitterness on the back end of the creamy and lightly effervescent mouthfeel. Just wonderful.",0.6849973388476128,4.75,0.9805
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2008 Vintage courtesy of KickInTheChalice.  Pours a deep, dark, beautiful red. Darker than the Kriek. There's a hint of white foam that fades into a ring over time. Perfection. I'll be using that term a lot when discussing this beer.  Smells incredible, like fresh raspberries. There's a tiny hint of lemon tartness, and a touch of funk, but the raspberries dominate the nose. Unbelievable.  Taste is equally perfect. Fresh squeezed raspberries assault the palate. It's tart, but not overwhelmingly so. Funk is negligable.  Feel is delightful, light crisp, well carbonated.  Overall - an outstanding beer. Top notch.",0.7046299023951742,5.0,0.9805
Scaled Up,Made the trek to Trillium n Treehouse last week and will def do it again. Picked up 4 brews from Trillium n all were stellar including this one. There isn't one thing about this brew that will blow you away - its not a Treehouse style juice/hop bomb but as you drink it you'll appreciate just how well its done. Super smooth and drinkable. Nice flavor that has long legs. You really need to drink a few of these to truly realize what a great brew it is. Well done.,0.593225545956047,4.75,0.9805
Beatification,"Batch 005. Thanks to Mista for this delicacy.   A: straw colored pour, fairly clear, with a thin head and decent lacing covering half of the top and refreshing from what looks like heavy carbonation.   S: slightly sweet, very tart, fruity - I get lemon and something more tropical I can't identify as well as some white grapes.   T: very tart, good lemon flavor, some sweetness or malt but I can't tell it's so wonderfully sour. There is a slight green apple tartness, but it takes a back seat to the lemon. Can taste some vinous notes too.   M: medium carbonation, medium-light body, and teeth-etching sourness.   O: very delicious beer. Wish it were easier and cheaper for RR to make.",0.6864369998995249,4.5,0.9805
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"My 2015 Halloween beer! 12.7 oz. bottle into a Duvel glass. Pours a very dark, oily brown and settles absoloutely pitch black in the glass. About a finger of dense, mocha-colored foam resulted from an aggressive pour; dwindled down to a thick lacing after about a minute. Definite bourbon notes on the aroma along with hints of maple syrup, baker's chocolate, roasted malts, and expresso. An intense, slightly abrasive aroma, but also quite sweet. The taste follows the smell note for note, initially presenting a huge bourbony profile followed by modest notes of chocolate, maple syrup, and sweet malt. While heavy on the bourbon, this beer is actually fairly complex once you get into it. Initially a little watery in composition, this beer thickens as it warms on the palate if you give it a chance. The result by the finish is a very smooth, drinkable bourbon-aged treat that, while delicious, begs to be cellared. I held on to this for a month, and couldn't resist it any longer. I'll be making the drive up to Akron the next time this is released to stock up.",0.6688789961156418,4.25,0.9804
Second Fiddle,"It's getting harder to rate IPAs these days because good IPAs are getting more plentiful and easier to find. The taste profiles are also catching up to the point where it's difficult to distinguish the better ones. To me, a few IPAs stand out and this stands up well against Heady Topper or Lawson's Sip of Sunshine.  It has a very pronounced orange taste ... one that comes on stronger when it kicks in. There is a bit of pine flavor/resin which is not as pronounced as in Lawson's or Heady Topper. It's a smooth drinking beer for sure. There is a slight bitterness to it balanced out by the citrusy juice. While I wouldn't necessarily call this a juicy IPA, it seems to blend the best qualities of East and West coast IPAs into one incredibly tasty beer.  I had it with lunch at The Chatham Bars Inn poured cold from a can into a pint glass. I was a bit surprised at seeing it there of all places and paid twelve bucks for the pleasure of tasting it. Now that I have, I will be on the lookout. This is better than anything Treehouse makes in my opinion and I could fill a fridge with it and not get sick of it.",0.6442886184477298,4.75,0.9804
Oude Geuze Vintage,"The culmination of my visit to Moeder Lambic in Brussels was a 750ml bottle of this gorgeous gueuze. Costing a whopping, but understandable €35, this 9-year old vintage was served with appropriate pomp and ceremony in a classic Belgian Gueuze basket. Lot number on the bottle said 13/04/2002.  Pours a deep golden colour, orange hued in places, with a frothy head of escaping bubbles. Lace sticks statically around the glass, but is otherwise rather still. The extra depth and darkness to the colour I put down to age. It looks good.  Nose is, oh god, just phenomenal. So classic, but melded and blended. That classic rubbery gueuze funk, along with tart fruit, apple skin, latex, vanilla, oak, and even a sweeter berry-like aroma. Aged characters like wine cork come through as well. There's so much too this, and it's immensely complex, but it's all so well integrated. You just don't get a better gueuze nose.  Taste is similar. All classic flavours of course, but all with a common purpose. Sharp fruit, grapeskin, wood, sawdust, oak, tannins. All these characters and more stay and dance on the palate leaving it complex, but long. It doesn't use the full breadth of the palate, but it must explore just about every element of the ""gueuze"" palate.  And age? What age? Apart from the integration and the mellowness of the characters' combination, this is as clean and crisp as ever. I can see this easily lasting another 10 years.  (But it's great now, too...)",0.7131872089896794,4.5,0.9804
Vicinity,"A - drinking from the can, I'm giving this one a 4.5 because the cans awesome. I'm sure if you pour it, you get to see it in all of its hazy glory but I just don't feel like pouring into a glass right now.  S - big peach, papaya, passion fruit, pine, grapefruit, smells like a great ne ipa T - big peach, papaya, dank hops, pine resin, ganja, light garlic onion, grapefruit, overly ripe fruits, adds more resin tones in the taste M - light to medium pillowy mouthfeel, bitter, aftertaste is mostly grapefruit pith, then pine, tropical fruits in the background, alcohol is covered. I'm starting to see how early dry hopping creates that interaction between hops and yeast that makes these beers so soft to drink.  O - I have to go with a 5 on this one. It's basically perfect. Great beer. I really couldn't ask for anything more. Honestly, I should just give the appearance a 5 too but I'll leave it at my first instinct.",0.6514885917622807,5.0,0.9804
Sure Bet,"Pours a turbid orange color with a finger of an off-white head. Looks like mango juice and something that would come out of the New England area.  Aroma is insane. Gigantic amounts of mango juice from the puree. Also get some grapefruit, good amount of orange, peach, pineapple, dankness, and light pine from the hops. Really no malt detected. The honey makes the aroma super juicy. Wow.  Taste follows the nose nicely. Get tons of mango juice, orange juice, dankness, slight peach, pineapple, and grapefruit. Finish brings a nice dryness, with a big dose of pine resin and orange peel bitterness. The honey sweetness keeps everything in check and makes the beer drink more like 7% than 9.5% abv. The juicy mango is the showcase, but the other flavors from the hops and the honey sweetness makes this one complex.  Medium body. Smoothly carbonated and super creamy. The creaminess makes this reminiscent of a fruit smoothie. Sticky and oily finish.  For me, it doesn't get much better than this. All of Pipeworks fruited DIPA's are great, but this one stands tall above the rest. If you enjoy mangos and hops, this is your beer.",0.657979107012358,4.75,0.9804
Enjoy By IPA,4/20/2017 version on tap at the Winking Lizard in Columbus Ohio. Served in a tulip glass. Brilliant Amber color and wonderful smell. Taste is like a strong IPA that just keeps going.

Peche 'n Brett,"pours a hazy yellow/orange, with a nice thick white head. The smell is LOADED with peach. You can smell it as soon as you pop open the bottle. Also a bit of funk in there. Sweet smelling. The taste is like the nose, but not as extreme. A nice subtle peach flavor, with a nice tart finish. Not overly tart though. A nice bit of farmhouse funk in there also.

Each sip opened up different flavors: Caramel, toffee, chocolate, cherry, raisin, honey, oak, maple syrup, brown sugar, marshmallow. Not sure on ABV, but it drinks like it is 8% - smooth and insanely drinkable for the style. Best barleywine ever consumed - easily 10 best beers of all-time",0.6790197727003621,5.0,0.9803
Juicy,"Big thanks goes out to 67couple for sharing this one at a past Random Sunday Tasting! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a dark hazy yellow-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, orange, fruit, sour, funk, earth, and wood. The flavor was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, fruit hop, wood, funk, earth, subtle sour, and orange zest. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was pretty good brew. I had heard lots of really good things about this one as it has quite a bit of hype going along with it. I am usually fairly skeptical when it comes to hyped beers, so this one wasn’t any different. Granted what I found was actually quite good and had a fairly good balance to it. This kept my palate refreshed and interested throughout the glass. I really wish that this one came in a larger format bottle so a larger pour could be enjoyed, but that is the nature of the beast I suppose. Definitely worth your time trying at least once if you get the chance, but I wouldn’t trade my soul to do so in my honest opinion.",0.6690091756513149,4.0,0.9803
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),I compare this one to Oskar Blue's Ten-Fidy but in a perfected way.

Very worth it.,0.6695985173800492,5.0,0.9802
Black Tuesday,"The Original. Pours black at night. Smells strong, but the flavors on this are spot on. Bourbon soaked raisin sweetness is the best I can do for a simple description. In my opinion, the best part about this beer is the velvety feel! It coats your entire mouth and stays there for a while. If you are looking to try any of the ""days"" from The Bruery, I would suggest going with this one first.  Edit: 2016 is straight fire! Loved it!",0.6238479242137824,5.0,0.9802

Long, bittersweet finish with lingering vanilla and dark chocolate. Tasty.  M: Not too thick, not too thin. Moderate carbonation.  O: Excellent beer, but not as memorable as it might have been.

Really great, hopefully I can score myself a bottle sometime soon!",0.6230243194970879,4.5,0.9801
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Pours entirely black with a sturdy khaki colored head, slowly fading to a slim ring of lacing.  The aromas intensity on this is insane - liquid dark chocolate hits the nostrils in a rather unprepared way, enhanced by roast and a subtle toffee sweetness, which leads to well nuanced, wooden bourbon aroma. There is an interesting glimpse of matured hops, which surprisingly enough adds to the prominent chocolate onslaugt, giving a light, herbal edge to the heavier, oily and decadent ingredients.   Has a perfectly smooth and creamy mouthfeel, complimenting to the huge body of the beer in a marvellous way. Turns almost a little chewy in the finish, without loosing its whipped cream softness at all.  Tastes of milk chocolate, which steadily turns more bitter and roasty, until it ends up as a potent example of dark chocolate with lots of roast and an opposite oily silkness, carrying a note of licorice. Bourbon joins in after the swallow, intruduced by a short herbal leaf note, adding a well placed warming dryness, spicy and sweet, rounded off by an earthy, oaken barrel. Finishes with brownie dough, almonds and a light smoke note among an even more profound chocolate foundation.  Incredibly tasty and well brewed, with just a well pronounced note of the bourbon barrel, which adds an oily, spicy decadence to the already huge body of the beer.",0.6958290692134949,4.75,0.9801
Society & Solitude #4,"Thanks to jhavs for this one. canned on 3/12/18, drink by date of 4/23/18. Hmm, only good for 5 weeks? Seems sorta sketchy. 12oz can poured into 12oz tulip. Poured a solid orange color with about 1/4 inch of white head that had low retention, but good lacing.  The aroma was fantastic, right from the crack of the can. A huge blast of citrusy hops. No real grain/malt presence.  This is one of the rare beers for me where the flavor doesn't live up to the scent. The hops were muted compared to the nose. Still no grain.  The body was thin, as seems to be typical for this style, and had a tart, dry finish.  Drinkability was good, the beer went down easily, and the flavors lingered long enough (a rare thing in this style, in my experience) that you didn't need to immediately grab another sip. Overall, a pretty nice brew, worth trying if you can.",0.6646895926412744,3.75,0.98

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"750ml, 2009 sticker, bottled in 2011. Into an oversized red wine glass.   A: Pours a gorgeous burgundy with a pink head that foams up to about half an inch and quickly fades away. Lively carbonation moves through the glass. Absolutely gorgeous, the color of raspberries.   S: Funky and sour with an absolutely huge raspberry aroma as well. Smells like crushed raspberries and oak barrel. Lots of funk and lacto sourness. Trademark Cantillon sour in the nose with a ton of raspberries as well. It does not get better than this, not at all.   T: Again, massive sourness and a ton of raspberries. Lots of funk and barnyard that follows over nicely from the nose. Intensely sour. Oaky and fruity. Fresh, ripe raspberries contribute to the pucker factor. Absolutely delicious.   M: Surprising amount of body, lively carbonation, incredibly puckering and dry. Tons of thick spit from the lacto. Spot on here.

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"11 Oz Bottle poured into glass Look - Partially clear but a little hazy deep yellow almost like gatorade. Very thick foam head leaves lacing on glass Smell - Strong mix of cloves and banana puree. A wisp of nutmeg, cinnamon, garlic, and some wheat.  Taste - Similar to the aroma, some vanilla notes added but the yeast really makes an appearance. Smooth and fresh taste. Carbonation is medium. The spices aren't too dominating which is nice. Everything is balanced, not too sweet either. On the light side but it is a wheat beer so that is to be expected, very easy drinking.   If you are new to these styles of beer, remember to swish the bottle around when you get towards the end of the pour so that the yeast is able to come out. Kicks up the flavor a notch. This is an excellent beer as the rating suggests. Mostly a summer beer because of the light-ish body. Would like to try it on tap but for the bottle version, I will give it an A-",0.6649613068860311,4.25,0.9798
Beatification,"Batch 5, poured into HF Goblet 7-17-13 at 45-50 degrees. Reviewed over the course of an hour.   A- Pours a copper orange color with a fluffy white head that appears to be churning from the vigorous carbonation, almost as if it were boiling. Fairly cloudy appearance. The head falls quickly leaving a ring around the edge of the glass, and minimal lacing.   S- I could smell how sour this thing was as soon as I popped the cork. Upon closer inspection, there are orange, lemon and apricot notes blended in with wet dirt, barnyard. and an amazing smelling yeast character that rounds it all out. It smells incredibly inviting.  T- Very sour right up front, dominated by lemon character. As the lemon fades, layers of funky barnyard, yeasty goodness, and a very enjoyable oak presence take over. The oak dries out the finish and leaves you wanting more of the fruit and funk character from the beginning.   M- Nice prickly carbonation is right on for style. This beer certainly has a mouth feel of it's own, that being an insane level of mouth puckering, sweat inducing sourness. The oak dries out everything at the end, yet isn't overpowering to the point where you feel like you need a sip of water to get rid of the cottonmouth. It is getting pretty close to that though...  O- Wow- I knew this would be good, but I didn't expect it to be this good. This beer is the definition of a beautifully crafted wile ale. Do whatever you can to get this beer, it is amazing.",0.6666206834181078,4.5,0.9798
Haze,"Sampling my first Tree House beer. Excited to check out the hype and experience the brewery. Have some cans of other examples waiting for me. Pouring the can cold into a snifter, the beer is a cloudy orange juice color with no light passing through my glass. A bleached white creamy head of 2 cm rests on the surface of my glass and remains as a sturdy surface layer throughout the sampling. The foam leaves dense lattice on the sides of my glass after each sip. Aroma is lots of fruit with some peach and apricot mixing with grapefruit and some orange as well. A little bit of rindy pith scents but otherwise fairly sweet and fruity on the nose. The first sip reveals a light body with very tingly carbonation and a smooth texture. The beer drinks very easy and is physically no challenge to consume. The flavor is all hops with lots of fruit notes throughout the sampling. I get hits of peach and grapefruit and then the middle is pithy citrus rind and slightly bitter flavor. This gives way quickly to a very orange flavor that is fairly sweet and lingers citrus on my palate. I do get sort of bready and creamsicle flavored burps occasionally but I dont get any detection of the 8.2% on the can.  Very drinkable brew and definitely depicting juice characteristic throughout the stages of sampling. Definitely worth trying if NE IPA/NE DIPA is your thing, but also pretty enjoyable for anyone.",0.6952246239504436,4.25,0.9797

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Original Review 1-12-2019 Picked up three singles Thanksgiving day 2018 from the Craft Beer Quick Stop for $7.49 each. From batch 23038 which was bottled on 10-16-18. Beer poured black as night with a nice tan head that is leaving lacing behind - 4.0.  Nose is cocoa, roasted malts, and bourbon-4.5.  Taste is a wonderful combination of roasted malts, cocoa, light vanilla, and bourbon. Alcohol heat with initial sips-4.75.  Mouthfeel is full bodied, perfectly smooth, creamy with awesome viscosity-5.0.   P.S. 1-12-19: Having a 2018 regular Expo Stout for beer #2 - it is definitely much more roasty and hoppy than the BBA version but it is all good! Overall this is an awesome brew, even at a young age - 4.75. The abv is very well hidden. I think I will have the other two bottles over 2019 to see how well it ages!",0.6133955749189363,4.75,0.9797
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Appearance is a lovely apple cider-like orange with no head. No bubbles. Smell is perfect - best smelling sour I've ever had. Smells like horse fart, hay, and wet golden retriever. Unbelievable. Taste is also great - bitter and harsh lemons that are so strong that I think my soft palate is swelling. It's thin, light, and refreshing.   Huge thanks to TOG (the original glazeman) for far and away the best sour I've ever had. This 2006 gem was everything and more that I could have ever expected.",0.6383215143864038,4.5,0.9797

Sip Of Sunshine,"A near perfectly clear yellow golden to light amber hue completely blanketed by a foamy white head. Excellent retention and lacing.  Smell is a smorgasbord of intoxicating aromas. Everything from lemon, orange, and grapefruit to gooseberry, mango, and sweet onion.  Flavors of tangerine, lemon, and lime are complimented wonderfully by sappy pine.  A smooth crisp start leans into a bit of a velvety /prickly sensation, ending with a sharp and lasting bitterness. The 8% promise is masked very well in this sticky, well carbonated concoction.  Overall, this is my jam. It's complexities are familiar, it's bitterness is unforgiving. In a world of confusing IPA's, this one stands out true. A modern day classic so to speak.

Enjoy By IPA,"I saw this on a menu yesterday in Birmingham while at work and immediately stopped by to try it for the first time on my way home. Served in a sniffer. Look is pale amber in color with about 3/4"" of head. Pungent odor of hops and hops and hops with slight citrus quaffed around the hops. The imagery of hops soaked in a pool of zesty seltzer water came to mind. Taste seems to be a never ending profile of hops that flows in waves throughout. Complex indeed but so incredibly smooth and refreshing. Truthfully with the ABV and varieties used I anticipated it to be overbearing but in typical stone fashion, it was not. Incredibly smooth and balanced throughout and had a wonderful mouth feel that coated so well. I am extremely impressed by this IPA and encourage anyone to get one while its good.",0.7018420566876851,4.75,0.9797
Peche 'n Brett,"This beer is exactly what it says it is.  Reviewers that are looking for a very tart wild ale will think that this doesn't live up the hype, but this beer never claims that. This is a saison with brett, crammed into an oak barrel and then fermented with peaches and then pear juice.   The nose is perfectly fragrant with peaches and brett.  The fruit comes through perfectly and plays harmoniously with the brett.   This beer is so delicate, that you have to close your eyes while you sip so that your senses are opened to the mastery that this liquid is.   To me, this beer is perfect because I can read a fucking label.",0.6429810964231293,5.0,0.9797
Haze,"This was poured into a tulip. The appearance lived up to it’s name, definitely orange haziness colored with a finger’s worth of white foamy head that leveled off at a nice pace. Sly thin lacing forms around the sides evenly. The aroma starts off with a bright and juicy orange juice, pulpy with big bitter balancing rind-like qualities. Sweet onion dankiness slides in for an extra ferocity of the aroma. The flavor brings it all together bittersweet with a spectacular orange juice to sweet onion aftertaste. Excellent sweet to danky finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium in body with a smooth sweet to bitter feel rolling over my tongue. Nothing clings, just feels absolutely awesome as it hits my tongue. Overall, hot damn, what an absolutely amazing DIPA. I would definitely have again.",0.6856399988375627,4.75,0.9796
Peche 'n Brett,"A beautiful and delicious beer, full of peach taste and especially aroma. It's an amplified version of Seizoen Bretta which is already one of my favorite beers. The brett dryness and fruity taste are perfectly balanced. What's especially wild is that the beer's appearance is opaque and pulpy from all the peach bits floating around in it. Just don't expect a ridiculously strong and sweet peach juice taste, as this is still certainly a brett beer that just happens to have peach as one of its main ingredients. It's all in perfect balance here, and they clearly hit what they were going for. And this really doesn't taste like 10%, I could drink it all day. Crisp, fizzy, fruity, funky, just delicious.",0.6936645560346636,4.75,0.9796
Todd The Axe Man,"Poured from a tallboy into a shaker pint, the beer is a slightly hazed, caramel-copper coloring, with a flurry of carbonation bubbling through the body, feeding a foamy, clingy, light, off-white head. Aromas of wet hops characteristics like sticky pine pitch, pepper spice, and moss, with a tangy caramel backbone, and solid citrus notes of grapefruit, orange, and lemon. Heavy, robust aromas coming off of this one. Flavors are dank and sticky forward, a blast of wet, green characteristics like pine needles, moss, and wet grass. Solid richly sweet backbone, with highlights of grapefruit tartness, orange rind sweet, and lemon zest. This has a ton of flavor, dynamic and balanced throughout on a rich, slick, oily body. The aftertaste is more of the sticky and resinous hops characteristics, with the citrus blend sliding into a supporting role. The finish is slick, bitter, and dry, with a lingering resinous character. Great beer.",0.7001094937754181,4.5,0.9796
Aaron,"Big thanks to Ineedabeerhere (thanks Joe) for the chance to try this amazing beer. Pours slightly darker than mahogany with no head,just a soapy slick. Nose is booze and sugary with some toffee notes. Taste is amazing! Everything an English Barleywine should be - sugary figs and maple syrup. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an almost still carbonation. This is just an amazing barleywine, one of the best, if not the best I've had to date.",0.6347754748337809,4.75,0.9796
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Served at the 2006 Dark Lord release party. $6 per serving - priceless!  Dark that is espected from a monster stout. Fine golden head rest above the darkness of the glass.  Aromal of oak barrel that complements the espresso, dark roasted barleys, chocolate, dark fruit nothing in the Three Floyds pub rivals this aroma.  Taste of decadent dark chocolate espresso malt with prunes, figs and caramel/chocolate-covered-cherries.   Mouthfeel is prototypical - the oak permeates all and seems to clean up the intense flavors. Alcohol is unnoticable in a sea of aromas and flavors. Perilously drinkable.  The pre- release Imperial Stouts offered up by those making the pilgrimage were a nice prelude but quickly fade from memory with the arrival of this at the booth. An excellent meal from the whole roasted hog added to the experience.  My complements to Nick Floyd and his crew for all their efforts in bringing another excellent vintage of the Dark Lord. Hope to return soon. Enjoy the bottle of Cherry Stout from Missouri!",0.6569564377791959,5.0,0.9796
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"12.7 ounce bottle, 2017 vintage. Served in a Jackie O's snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head. Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing. I like the aroma a lot, the brew smells like bourbon, vanilla, cinnamon, chocolate, nuts, and some oak. For the most part I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but the chili pepper spiciness kicks in along with some coffee and sugariness. The chili pepper flavor gets stronger as the brew warms up more, and the lingering spicy finish also gets stronger the longer I drink this. With that being said, the spiciness isn't close to being overpowering. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's slick and smooth with a good amount of carbonation. I thought this was really good, don't pass this one up if you come across a bottle! Jackie O's did a great job with this one. $11.99 a bottle.",0.6373270523981137,4.5,0.9796

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),(Served in a short plastic cup)  A- This beer has an inky black body that stains the side of the cup after each sip the head is a thin cinnamon brown that turns to a small ring around the edge pretty quickly.   S- The powerful smell of oak and coffee roasted malt come through even as I lift the cup of the table. The complex smell is very smooth and blended but notes of bourbon and coffee come through with faint molasses and a hint of vanilla.   T- This slightly sweet black malt has flavors similar to the smell with bourbon and vanilla coming through with a nice wood flavor. The soft taste of coffee beans comes through at the finish.   M- This beer has a full creamy mouthfeel with no alcohol warmth or astringency.   D- This is what Dark Lord has been missing. I like DL for its big punch in the face flavor but the aged in oak DL is blended all those flavors an added some more mysterious layers. This was truly an amazing beer.  Thanks to Diesel for buying this round.,0.6587954680378687,5.0,0.9795
Haze,"Pours a bright yellow, clouded color with a one finger broad white head.  Smells of a tropical mix of grapefruit, passion fruit and fresh squeezed lime pulp. Offers a tropical sweetness on the nose, without a hint of malts but a plethora of well diversed hops instead.  Has a medium, smooth and soft mouthfeel with a long lasting fruitiness and just a dry note during the aftertaste of the beer.  Tastes of lime pulp, dried oranges and papaya, with a crackery maltiness underneath. Has a light effervescence onwards from its mid palate, together with riper turning fruits. Finishes calm, well nuanced on the still fruity hops, which add a little bit of sweetness, creating a papaya, passion fruit impression.  Very hop forward in a tropical ne ipa way, well nuanced with an astonishing depth, resulting seemingly solely from the hops themselves.",0.7140927496950887,4.25,0.9795
Black Tuesday,"2012 vintage (19.2%) served into a snifter.  Aroma – I pick up massive bourbon and alcohol. I'm having trouble picking up much else. If I closed my eyes, I'd swear it was an actual glass of bourbon I smell.  Appearance – A quickly dissipating head, opaque, a bit murky. This beer is actually leaving fingers on the sides of my glass.  Mouth feel – full, but not as thick as I was expecting, medium carbonation, coating the inside of my mouth, warming as I swallow. I think my tongue is a bit numb like it is being anesthetized.  Taste – I pick up ""the usual suspects"" for an imperial stout – dark fruits (plum, cherry, raspberry), vanilla, cocoa, fudge, caramel. Aspects of the taste reminded me of the goo you get from the inside of a chocolate covered cherry. There is also wonderful bourbon / oak flavors along with a touch of leather (in a non-sexual way). I pick up some hops, but the beer finishes with a candy sweet aftertaste.   Overall – there are controversies about this type of imperial stout, but I absolutely loved it. I split this bottle with my wife and we took approximately 90 minutes to finish it. The experience was worth every minute of that 90. We drank a toast to Kevo2007 (the wonderful BA who sent me this bottle), the FedEx driver who delivered the package, the brewer at The Bruery who created this beer, and everyone else in between.",0.6344881212829928,4.75,0.9795
Juicy,"Bottle poured into my snifter.   A: Pours a hazy, golden color with a small white head.  S: Smells funky! Lots of pineapple and wine barrel notes as well.  T: Wow, this tastes amazing. Reminds me of Mimosa but with tropical flavors instead of citrus. Lots of grapefruit, pineapple flavors followed by nice tartness. M: Carbonation is spot on. Very nice. It feels juicy, with nice refreshing tartness. Clean finish.  O: I can't decide which is my number one but this just earned a top spot in my HF list, up there with Mimosa and Damon. Reminds me a lot of Mimosa, which is definitely a good thing.",0.6445877319634388,4.5,0.9795
Sip Of Sunshine,"Thanks to my brother in law who got this and a handful of other gems for me on his latest northeast excursion.Pours a clear rich golden with a half finger white head that leaves 'blotches' of broken lace behind as it settles.Pineapple sweetness and mango fruitiness stand out most in the nose,maybe a little sweet onion as well,fruit on top of fruit.Pineapple and orange flavors with a sticky, sugary element to it with a great smoothness.Although there is a decent amount of sweetness there isn't a big malt bill to the beer,it's just sweet hop juice.Just awesome.",0.6407846526149203,4.25,0.9795

Scaled Up,"Picked up a growler at the new Canton facility. Heard the first batch of Scaled Up was good but didn't have the house characteristics (read: super wet dank haze) Trillium is known for. After trying a sample of the second batch, I knew this was a different beer. Poured like OJ concentrate with a nice pillowy head. Smelled amazing, like boozy fruit juice. Taste was that of a classic New England IPA....juice blanket. Perfect carbonation. My only gripe would be the booziness and my lack of self control.",0.6268271056956383,4.0,0.9794
Scaled Up,"L - murky brownish orange with a floofy head that quickly and loudly dissipates. Pop Rocks.   S - sweet grape candy. Candied lemon pith and a wet earthiness, much like fresh rain. Guava.   T - grape must and grapefruit. Spicy and tangy, yet smoothed out by elegant flavors of white wine, orange vanilla, and peach. Some nice pineapple bite spackled with pepper. Ripe wild berries and a strong herbal bitterness to finish.   F - far too drinkable with just the right amount of creaminess. Relatively low in carb for a Trillium canned beer, but still kinda disjointed in that it foams up a bit too much and is overtly prickly.   O - the Nelson is the hero in this beer. Mellows out all the flavors, and there are a lot of them, with a gentle, yet invigorating, vinous character. Great blend of harmonious flavors.",0.6844083030792946,4.5,0.9794
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Bottle  Best Damn Sour Fest Bootlegger San Diego, CA  Dark ruby and red with pink edges and a thin pink head. Leaves small spots and thin webs of lacing down the glass.   An incredible combination consisting of incredibly powerful, stinging sourness, plump and juicy cherries, and earthy oak. Everything is in balance yet powerful, all at once. Perfect.  The flavor too is just phenomenal. The cherries are vibrant and tart, the sourness is consistent and strong from sip to swallow. This is lip puckering stuff here! Phenomenal.  Medium bodied with high carbonation.  A truly special beer. One of my favorites.",0.6919089671023143,4.5,0.9794
Caffè Americano,"Pours as black as ink with a 1-2 finger thick brown head that was packed with tiny bubbles, dissipating slowly and leaving minimal spotty lacing. It was surprising to see such little head retention.  Smells of fresh ground coffee, roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate, faint vanilla, cold press coffee, smoked malts, charred wood or campfire smoke, cocoa powder, cream and hazelnut coffee. It's so complex it almost seems barrel aged. Really nice delivery of all things coffee, this is a pleasure to breath in.  Flavor is as good as the nose with fresh ground coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, roasted coffee beans, espresso, cold pressed coffee, smoked malts/grains, charred wood, campfire smoke, hazelnut coffee, cocoa powder, cream and the additions of toffee, molasses, dark fruits, roasted nuts, milk chocolate, and Raisinetes. The bitterness from the coffee prevents it from being too sweet, but it does resemble bakers chocolate as it finishes. Super complex and very malty, but the coffee and chocolate bring in fruity notes, roastiness and a slight herbal tart pucker.   Coffee lovers should seek this out as it never lets it foot off the coffee pedal. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but it has that cold espresso feel and hides the ABV completely so it doesn't have to be a slow sipper. Glad I got 2 bottles of this as it was overall an excellent beer.",0.6237570675335342,4.75,0.9794
Scaled Up,"I'm from CT, relatively close to NEBCO, so I've been fortunate to have the hoppy stuff those guys crank out for as long as I can remember.   Trillium had become a consistent stop on trips up to Boston, and brews like this are why. I know Julius gets a ton of hype, and it's a great beer, but to me Scaled Up does the best, most balanced juice bomb I've tasted.  Scaled Up is right in line with Julius & Sip of Sunshine,with some additional tropical hop dankness the other two don't seem to present as much.  As with most Trillium brews I've had, drink this one fresh. I try to within a week to week and a half of acquiring. Maybe it's just me, but I feel like the maltiness really comes out in a relatively short amount of time with trilliums hop bombs.  I mean,my god, think about how many great breweries are putting out just super tasty hoppy stuff in the northeast right now. Trillium is right up there.",0.6079970543399389,4.75,0.9793
Black Tuesday,"The Bruery - Black Tuesday, poured into a Lawson's tulip.  Look - Pours a thin viscosity brown and settles black with minimal head. Not much lacing.  Smell - Chocolate malts and bourbon. Smells delish.  Taste - Rich chocolate followed by a nice bourbon warmth. Sweet oak vanilla finish.  Mouthfeel - Full bodied with medium carbonation.

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Complete vertical (01 - 09 based on sticker) shared by Mr. Bubbler on his b-day. The following is a comparison and rating is based on the average score of all:  A: Ranged from 3.5 to 4.5. Pours a pinkish red (older) to reddish pink (younger) all with a pink head which varied from almost nothing (02 and 03) to quite foamy (07). Lace was generally trace.  N: Ranged from 3.5 to 4.5. Varied from a vibrant bright fruit (09) to just slightly (03) notable. Younger bottles were much less funky and musty compared to the older ones which were more wild and earthy.  T: Range from 4.0 to 5.0. Plenty of basic moldy, chessy funk in all. Tartness more evident in older bottles. Some lemon present in 06. Intense sourness in 02. Surprise was 01 still fruity.  M: Range from 3.5 to 4.5. Semi-moderate body consistent across all bottles. Carbonation varied from foamy to nearly nothing. Tart to very sour and puckering. Cheesy, musty, dusty, earthy dry finish not so varied but older bottles generally tasted ""older"".  O: Range from 4.0 to 5.0. Highlights included the fresh fruit of the 09, the intense sourness of the 02, and the still wonderful 01. Very fortunate to have been a part of this event.

Schaerbeekse Kriek,"A: A somewhat hazy deep red and amber color, the head is kind of small, but its got a thin ring of lace around the glass, and stay throughout my sipping...  S: A very very good oak character, not an overpowering bit of oak, but smooth, and mellow, then the Kriek or cherry smell comes in, this isn't artificial at all, and you can tell. It finishes semi-tart in the nose, quite enticing for the taste...  T: What a beer, sour sour cherry flavor, tHe cherry is real, and reminds you of ripe red cherries, just overwhelming! Oak fills out the flavor as it leaves your mouth somewhat pucker but also looking for more...  M: This is perfectly carbonated, perfectly bodied, and begs to be had in moderation...  D: A great sour pucker!",0.673478927340962,5.0,0.9792
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"12 oz bottle dated 10/16/18 poured into Ommegang snifter.   Deep rich blacks meet a half finger of steady beige head leaving sparse clouds of lacing behind. Nice and shiny.   The aroma from the bottle is INTOXICATING. Rich tobacco, toast, and leather meet cured, aged, bourbon soaked wood in the best way possible. It should be a cologne. From the glass is similar but less concentrated and more plum and chocolate are apparent. I'm gonna side with the bottle on this one and give it a 4.75 for smell.   The flavor is not nearly as fantastic as the nose gives off, but make no mistake it's still competent. The most dominant note is smoke. Some plum, red grape, and brown leather pop up with slight flecks of caramel, licorice, maple toast, oak, and earthy vanilla. The smoke still remains, and maple toast continues on through the finish.   Feel is sticky and viscous, with a hot finish. Moderate carbonation.   Overall, all things considered with price and rarity being a factor, I feel there are much better beers to be had for the effort and price. BCBS being an easy choice (though I'm not directly comparing this beer to it). The smell is just phenomenal on this, but the rest of it leaves a lot to be desired. A good beer to try once, unless you really feel you want to commit to a $30/4 pack.   Edit : Age does this one good. About 2 years works perfect (just had a 2017).",0.6469759670442699,4.25,0.9792
Scaled Up,"By far one of my favorite hazy IPA's from Trill. I feel like i say that every time i try a new one. This one is a beautiful yellow amberish hue with tons of haze. It has an amazing aroma coming from the dry hopping and hops combo which they killed. Citrusy, dank, notes of mango, grapefruit, subtle sweetness but also malty enough to balance great with the hops creating an almost perfect mouthfeel. Love you Trillium!",0.6738167161506705,4.75,0.9792

Almost not carbonated we can see few bubbles floating trough the glass but not a lot.   S- Tropical fruit, citrus fruit. Also get peach and mango in nose wich I find really nice!  M- Intense hoppiness of course mixed with the citrus fruit previously smelt. Mid mouth taste go into an alcool-sugar ( mango, peach ) mix wich make a complex and perfect balance between the bitterness. The aftertaste stay in mouth a long time wich is appreciable.

The scariest moment was the smell ,expecting the worst after seeing the shape the cork was in I immediately knew it was fine with one sniff ...taste and mouthfeel are the reason this beer is so sought after wow Tart raspberries with a full mouthfeel and wonderful funk ....one of the best beers I've had in recent memory",0.6122208409191432,4.75,0.9791
Todd The Axe Man,"Poured from a 16oz can into glass. Bottom of can is stamped 'CANNED ON 08/31/17 F3970 10:02'. Mostly hazy, darker orange body, some dark 'floaties', one finger white head settles to thin cap, some lacing. Aroma is fruity citrus hops. Taste has citrus and piney hops. Sweet and bitter, well balanced. Medium, satisfying mouth feel. Quite stinging on tongue. Slurp-able. This pour may be a little past prime but still is a very flavorful and true to style Minnesota style IPA. Try to find as fresh as possible to get true effect from flavor full hops and strong malt back bone. For those who like IPA's, this is as close to ""candy"" (a true treat) as any.",0.6766480966871405,4.5,0.979
Madagascar,"Pour is black and thicker than I was expecting based on others' reviews with little to no head. Definitely lots of bourbon and vanilla notes, with dark chocolate in the background; I can almost get a bit of cognac too which is surprising. The taste is sweet and smokey. I was expecting more vanilla, but chocolate is more dominant here with vanilla playing a supporting role. The barrel complements all of the flavors nicely to create a complex dessert of a beer. As others have noted, it is a bit thin with more carbonation than the head would imply, but it makes it pretty smooth and drinkable rather than sitting heavy.   Overall, it's probably the best beer of this style. If it were more readily available, I'd drink a ton of it, but it's something I can get by with drinking 1-2 bottles of a year.",0.6820540891001893,4.5,0.979
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Pours a pitch black with a dark tan/mocha head.  Aroma starts off with lots of chocolate followed by some vanilla, cinnamon, hint of pepper, touch of bourbon and oak too. Smells really good!  Taste is actually dominated by the heat from the habanero first and then goes in a rich, fudge-like dark chocolate, sweet vanilla, some nutty notes, caramel/toffee sweetness, finishes with a bit of oak and cinnamon too. Definitely a bourbon presence, but not as much as most Jackie O's BA beers.  Full bodied, creamy, almost chewy mouthfeel, hard to tell where the bourbon heat begins/ends and the habanero heat begins/ends, but this is still pretty smooth.  Big, dark, complex. Just an amazing beer and one of the best Jackie O's has put out! Stellar stuff!!",0.6535792790718566,5.0,0.979
Oude Geuze Vintage,"2002 Vintage (red label), sampled July 2010  Pours with an enormous white head, looks great for being 8 years old, a lightly hazed orange-amber-peach, a bit darker than I expected.  Smell: Perfect, tart and funky, tart and sour apples and grapes, elements of oak, sweat, damp stone, leather, and farmhouse / horse blanket.   Taste: Nice mild acidity, a perfect complement to the funk. Tart and funky as I said above, sour apples and grape with hints of oak, sweat, damp stone, leather and farmhouse / horse blanket. Also a white wine / sauvignon blanc element. Perhaps the most refined tasting Gueuze I have encountered. The taste is much less funky than the nose.  Mouthfeel: Creamy with a nice prickly mouthfeel; impressive for the age; very dry  Drinkability: Amazing, this is one of the best Gueuzes I have ever tasted.",0.6688259910777363,5.0,0.9789
Darkstar November,"Bottle  Deep brown to black in color and opaque. No head on the pour but a minor minor ring forms when sitting. Nice lacing on a sip.  Nose is strongly molasses and booze, a bit of chocolate, and a bit of oak.  Taste is molasses sweetness and smoke, bourbon, oak, rye spice, and a bit of black coffee.  Mouthful is medium to heavy and smooth with a bite. Carbonation is low. Finish is semi sweet.  A very nice beer. Very drinkable - better cold imo. Warming brings out the booze. A bit aggressive but otherwise very very nice.",0.6606715819356064,4.5,0.9789
Aaron,"Batch 2 (2016).  A: Pours a deep amber with some brown highlights. A ring of off white head dissipates quickly. No lacing.   S: Plum, cherry, and raisin in the forefront with light toffee, chocolate, and sherry. A whisp of oak and bourbon are fairly well integrated, and a bit of alcohol peaks through.   T: Follows the nose with fruit-forward flavor (plum, raisin, cherry), very light toffee and barrel presence (a little too light). A medium sweetness lingers on the finish, maybe a bit sweeter than ideal but not terribly out of place for the style.   M: Full bodied, thick, with medium-light carbonation. Very mild alcohol heat, it’s surprising how easy this drinks given the ABV.  O: A delicious treat. The barrel and caramel flavors take a back seat to the fruit, which is fine but I wish they were a little more prominent.",0.6806813776108672,4.75,0.9789
Green,"UPDATED REVIEW: Canned 7/12, consumed 7/17.  A: More than any other beer I’ve ever had, this beer pours like freshly squeezed orange juice. Incredibly turbid and vibrant in the glass. Puffy head of tiny bubbles sticks around for a while, leaving a thick lacing up the glass.  S: Straight up perfectly ripe, sugary sweet citrus fruit. Orange, tangerine, pineapple, peach. Subtle notes of freshly cut herbs. Doughy, sugary white bread. Ripe banana. Bubble gum. Insanely tropical and appetizing.   T: Tropical fruit explosion. Right off the bat, Green hits you with some powerful hop flavors. The Tree House tasting notes are spot on—I definitely get the orange sorbet and pineapple. Some peach and yellow grapefruit as well. It’s initially extremely juicy without much sweetness, which allows you to really hone in on the explosion of flavor. The tropical burst transitions into the typical Tree House sweet bready yeast. Finishes with perfect level of bitterness over herbaceous notes of pine.  M: Unbelievably creamy and drinkable for a 7.5% beer. Tropical fruity flavors coat the mouth before being overtaken by a medium bitterness that accompanies the rich, piney, herbaceous aftertaste.   O: This is my second time having Green, and I can definitively say that it is my favorite IPA (from a list that includes Julius…). The initial tropical burst is perfectly complemented by the soft, doughy mouthfeel that follows. The transition to a substantially bitter, resinous, almost vegetal herby finish is one of the most unique and enjoyable aspects of this beer. I could drink this everyday. Totally deserving of my first 5/5.",0.7098937081640722,5.0,0.9789
Haze,"Picked up this morning at the brewery s not even a Day old.  Poured into a treehous tulip.  Look: beautiful trademark treehouse look, as the name says, hazy. One finger bright white head. Beautiful opaque light yellow orange, looks like juice.   Smell: bursting with ripe peach, pineapple, mangos, papaya and every tropical fruit imaginable.   Taste: so floral, Big mango, big pineapple, peach pulp. Absolutely killed the flavor of this one two thumbs up.   Mouthfeel: again classic treehouse beautiful little bubbles rush over every centimeter of your palate and infuse the tropical flavors right into your taste buds. Creamy and oily.  Overall: other then green my favorite regular offering from treehouse, so complex with so many different fruits coming to mind. Absolutely love this beer and put it up there with my favorite .

Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"12 fl oz bottle sealed with pressure cap.  poured into Spiegelau tulip.  Appearance: opaque black body. Medium brown head that pour two fingers tall at cellar temperature. Head has nice staying power and remains a thick cap for almost the entire drink. Plenty of creamy sticky lacing left behind as the head slowly recedes.  Smell: Fresh roasted coffee beans with a big bold earthy and smokey aroma. Lots of oak barrel. Light bourbon notes. Hint of cocoa nibs.  Taste: This is a coffee forward stout with a light bourbon finish. The coffee still tastes very fresh just like the aroma smells. Dark chocolate, molasses, and tobacco. Strong oak presence in the middle. Finish has a hint of oak and then the bourbon shows up. The bourbon is slightly spicy with caramel and brown sugar notes. Roasty fresh brewed coffee lingers on for minutes after each sip.  Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low carbonation that is adequate. Beer drinks light despite its huge bold flavors. Not boozy at all. Very well balanced.   Overall: The coffee beans in this stout remind me a lot of Intelligensia Espresso used for crafting bourbon county coffee stout. This beer is really enjoyable because it is a coffee bomb with huge flavors that are very well balanced. This is a great Jackie O's offering!",0.6675452361721163,4.5,0.9788
Haze,"Of the half dozen or so Tree House offerings that I have had, I still think that this is my overall favorite. It looks beautiful in the glass, as do most all of their beers - appears as a hazy, golden pineapple with a bit of white head that leaves a very nice lacing as the beer goes down. Nose consists of tropical fruit and citrus along with notes of peach. Taste is similar but mixed with a touch of dank hops. That note of peach comes through in the taste as well and there are hints of pepper towards that finished that make me assume there's some Amarillo hops to this one, which is likely why I'm such a fan of this beer. Feel is as expected - smooth and slightly creamy. Overall, this is an excellent beer that I wish I could get consistently and IMO, the best of their ""regular"" offerings.",0.6697276447189443,4.75,0.9788
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2006 Vintage. Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tasting glass.  Appearance: The cloudy color is instantly recognizable as the only color raspberries can be. A nice soft white froth gently recedes to a ring around the edge along with a few wisps of lace.  Smell: The raspberry in the aroma is quite sour. There are some light malt notes, and some good funk in there, but at this point it is mostly sour.  Taste: The raspberry flavor in this beer is just brilliant. With five or so years in the bottle, the flavor has become balanced between tart and funky.   Mouthfeel: I suspect that over time the body has dried out and lightened up a bit as the beer continued to develop. At this stage the body is on the light side of medium, with medium strength fizzy carbonation. Somewhat acidic, but not overly so.   Overall: I am a sucker for good raspberry sours, and this is probably my favorite one at this point. Simply fantastic, I would like to always have this in my fridge, and my future beer purchases will probably reflect that desire.",0.6972412675524412,5.0,0.9788
Black Tuesday,"Had to adjust my rating here. The fact that this is a really good beer is completely overshadowed by a pretentious, conceited brewery with rude employees. Unfortunate, but that kind of pretentious nonsense is repulsive to me. Lots of great beers out there, enjoy it if you want, then move on...it is not all it is made to be. Overpriced...   Enjoyed a bottle of this with my brother on 19 April 12. We chilled the beer for a while, but probably cooled it down a little more than we should have. I prefer some of these bigger stouts with a slight chill, and sometimes close to or right at room temperature. This beer started out really strong on alcohol...the alcohol almost overpowered the flavor and taste of the beer. We probably took about 25-30 minutes to go through the bottle, and by the time it warmed up closer to room temp it was getting really, really good. The last sips were the best. I have another bottle of BT and will be drinking it a lot closer to room temp (60 degrees or so).  A: pitch black S: Licorice, alcohol, figs, molasses  T: See above, at cooler temps alcohol smothers underlying flavors, takes away from the beer M: silky smooth, very thick O: really nice...can't wait to enjoy another!!",0.5906082032231962,4.5,0.9788
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Cantillon Lou Pepe Framboise is perhaps the most classic and refined beer I've ever tried - but it has the colour of a Swedish Berry candy, the glossiness of nail polish, and looks flamboyant enough to be singing a Liza Minnelli tune. Even its head is hot pink.  This has a smell reminiscent of a dank, musty basement - the fruitiest, most perfumed and agreeable wet basement you'll ever come across. There's a strong whiff of oak wood but most of all there's the wild yeasts and trademark bacteria of the Senne Valley. It's a scent unique to Brussels and, more specifically, one that can instantly be traced back to Cantillon.  Jean Van Roy - pick your generation - is a prolific father; others have carried on his sour, wild yeast and barrel-aging lineage, but Lou Pepe Framboise reminds us ""who's your daddy"". Nothing is this distinctly funky, obviously fermented *and* friendly. The extra dosage of fruit doesn't distract from the sour Lambic but increases the subtle flavour present in the Rosé De Gambrinus.   One is always kept aware of the old oak barrels in which this beer is aged (minimum of two years in Lou Pepe's case). As is virtually always the case with every Fruit Lambic Cantillon brews, the contents of the wood are as apparent as (or arguably more than) the fruit. This thing has a shot of lemon juice with every mouthful; very sour but also, in a huge way, very refreshing.   Of all the dozens of Lambics I've reviewed on my home (North American) turf, none have recaptured and recalled the charm, character and cuisine of Belgium - at least those elements that I've always taken away from it - better than Lou Pepe Framboise. Each trip to Brussels is relived with every sip. It is a dazzling beer and easily one of the more memorable ones I've tried.",0.6242843359999318,5.0,0.9788
Scaled Up,"750ml bottle served in a tulip. Pours a dub orange with a slight haze to the clarity and a half-inch, frothy, bright white head. Great nose - bright citrus fruit notes, rind and a hint of spice. Taste consistent with nose - tangerines, rind and a kiss of an earthy/herbal quality to add some complexity. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with a pleasant, even carbonation and a kiss of acidity. Overall, another solid DIPA from Trillium. Not my favorite simply because they have so many outstanding offering; however, really fresh and quaffable.",0.7162907864465261,4.0,0.9788
Beatification,"Bottle poured into a snifter.  Look: Straw colored, slight haze, more in the second glass, I assume from a bit of the sediment sneaking out. A bit fizzy with a foamy head. The bubbles pop fast and settles into a small ring around the glass.  Smell: Citrus zest, tartness, earthy oak, a bit of dank funk.  Taste: Quite tart, hint of crisp white wine, sour lemon juice, sour but not puckering or unpleasant. The earthiness from the oak cleans everything up and balances the flavors nicely.  Feel: Light bodied, active carbonation, effervescent.  Overall: Blissful, clean flavors for something that should be hard to taste clean. Dry, tart, earthy and inviting all at the same time.",0.694158686282175,4.5,0.9788
Nectarine Premiere,"Look- Nice orange color, my guess would be it was a nectarine sour just from looking at it poured in a glass.  Smell- This was the best part, the nose on this is perfect, super funk nectarine, almost smells like its going to sweet when you taste it.  Taste- Sour nectarine with that classic de garde funk  Feel- Super funky lasts from beginning to end, pretty bubbly.",0.6334974137920351,4.75,0.9788
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"750ml bottle poured into a Plan Bee Taster.  A~ yellowy orange with a tiny head and no lacing.  S~ tons of white wine funk! lots of lemon/lime up front followed by bretty hay and dank juicy hops... whoa!!  T~ more delicate here. more white wine funk followed by more lemon/lime. very slight bitterness from the hops which also adds a orange peel/lemon zest kind of feel and slight white pepper on the end. delicious!  M~ smooth with nice carb. the brett coats the tongue which makes it kind of clawing but it doesn't bother me! just helps to keep the flavor in (and around) your mouth hahaha!  O~ seriously one of the best barrel aged offerings from HF, up there with Art and Ann in my opinion! if it wasn't for the mouthfeel this would probably be perfect in my book! everything i look for in a crazy saison! don't sleep on this... or do! i'll take more =]",0.6278447506575443,4.75,0.9787
Oude Geuze Vintage,"2002 vintage, 750ml bottle with a red label.  Hazy with a sunset-amber hue. High levels of carbonation feed a solid, sustaining head.  This beer reeks of damp wood and dusty basement. Very musty, the richness of the oak enhances the funk and lemon and orange-like acidity.  Oaky, earthy and tannic, a nice firm sourness is expertly balanced by the wood. Highly carbonated, almost champagne-like in mouthfeel, this is complex yet refreshing. Sourness is purely lactic, there's not a trace of vinegar. It finishes with big tannins, hay, earth and lemon rind. This is an outstanding vintage of an already great gueuze.  05 vintage: Citrusy tropical fruit backed by musty funk and oak. Moderately tannic, less so than the 02 and 07 vintages. The tropical fruit character makes this very unique. Might be my favorite of the 3 I've tried.  07 vintage: Strongly tannic with moderate sourness and funk. I was very impressed with this vintage, and it should continue to improve with age.",0.7025880481221283,5.0,0.9787
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"2017 bottle courtesy of @FlintB back in NBS BIF #007.  Side by side with a 2013 bottle of the basic Expedition.  Pour is immediately evident that there's some differences. Dark brown head gathers and sits in a cloudbank across the middle (compared to a pale desaturated brown for the basic). A gentle swirl brings all the fuzzy mocha brown head back to coat the top. Thick obsidian body absorbs all light coming it's direction.   Nose is more mellow than I'd expected. Some light spice and faint cocoa, and a fair amount of molasses and some roast. Doesn't smell like alcohol per se, but as I withdraw I can feel the evaporating ether withering in my nostril.  Taste is smoothe chocolate and coffee and toffee and some wood and is just really rich and delicious.   Holy shit this may be the smoothest most velvety perfectly soft and viscous drink I've ever imbibed. And while it doesn't taste low-ABV by any means, the 12.8 is dangerously easy to forget about. This may be the best mouthfeel I've ever encountered in a beer.   Man, thanks Brian for sending this my direction. I will now be forever on the lookout for this in addition to the basic Expedition from these guys.",0.6495189394452162,4.75,0.9787
Aaron,"Poured into a snifter.  Surprisingly fizzy head and sound from the pour. The head forms a half finger thick, gaseous and fairly quick to dissipate. It's khaki-colored. The body is a deep brown, I hate to say, but think dooky, and continuous carbonation is visible. 4.25  First thoughts on the aroma are a boozy raisin or pannetone. Bread, raisin and booze. Hints of caramel. Rum raisin bread pudding (I had to google this to connect what I was thinking) is an excellent descriptor. 4.25  Palate follows the nose to a T. Funny thing is I think I like the taste more than the aroma although I can't say why given how closely they resemble one another. It's interesting to me how much this brew resembles some of the dessert wines I'm familiar with from the Latin American world and Spain. Raisiny, dark caramel notes, and a taste of booze that is agreeable and fits. 4.25  Although I've mentioned booze a couple of times, this brew is not in any way hot. It's about as smooth as can be. Creamy, medium-bodied, and lightly yeasty mid- to end-palate. The finish is semi-dry. 4.5  It's kind of rare nowadays to find a barleywine that hasn't been gobbled up by barrels and their corresponding flavors, so that makes this particular brew extra enjoyable. It's a gem for sure.",0.6773947787463248,4.25,0.9787
Fort Point Pale Ale,"Finally got to the brewery when they had this! 16 oz. can dated 8/27/19, poured into Aslin glass.  L: Hazy golden with just a hint of orange. 1.5F soapy head with scant lacing and a ring.  S: Peach-orange with just a hint of earth and pine. Nice and clean.  T: Very much mirrors the nose. Not sure how flavors can be both bold and soft, but they've done it. What I like is the developing flavor profile from peach to citrus to ripe tropical to pine/earth. And in a pale ale!  F: Moderate side of light-body, but smooth like a Christopher Cross song. Light to moderate carbonation. Very easy drinking. Construction and balance are superior.  O: Probably too much ABV to be called a true sessionable ale, but this is the one you want. Put it right up alongside Julius and it's tough to pick a winner. So why pick? Drink them both.",0.6693783521547799,4.5,0.9787
Dragonsaddle,"L: Pours a dark gold with a nice head that stays around a bit. S: Dank with some citrus. And with some candy in there. Smells very sweet for how much alcohol is packed into here. T: Dank and more dank. This reminds me of heady topper as if it became a triple. The citrus is toned down, but the candy comes through on the taste more than it did on the nose, and moreso than any IPA I've had. But without being sugary or sweek - it complements the dank & juice. It's a really enjoyable drink, and the flavors come out even more as it warms a bit. F - Super smooth, again very much reminds me of heady topper.  O - Amazing beer, really glad to have tried it.",0.6278873696818447,4.75,0.9787
Black Tuesday,"750ml bottle poured into Bruery tulip. Received both in a BIF from 2beerdogs, thanks!  Thought I should start with the OG before moving on to the days of the week variants. Drank at recommended temperature of 55 (give or take). The pour is somewhat disappointing. Brown and cola like, 3/4"" of large bubbles that just fizzed away very quickly. Just about thought this was infected. Thankfully it is not. From my first whiff I get anise, some roast, a ton of bourbon, figs and just a hint of chocolate. Moving on to the taste. First sip was all the raisins. Going back for more produced just a bunch of heat, whiskey, burnt caramel. I'm getting some root beer, Hershey's syrup on the back end, and definitely coconut and marshmallow from the wood. I've tasted old ales and barleywines that have these flavors but without this heat. If I had regular access to this I'd let it sit for a year or two. The booze is strong on this one.  Now to the most disappointing component...for a beer to be this big, I needed a thick, velvet coating of the mouth aspect. Black Tuesday does not have it. And that's going to bring my rating down by a lot.  My overall impressions-Everyone should try this beer. It has cult status in my opinion. I'm very glad to have tried it. Fresh out of the gate, it's too hot to enjoy, it needs time to rest. Since I did open it fresh, it's unique, hot and complex. I enjoyed it over the course of a few hours letting new flavors develop as it warmed.",0.6192643808724546,3.75,0.9786
Chocolate Rain,"Decided to open this one with a few friends during our annual trip to Maine. Batch #2.  A- No carbonation at all really. Pour was slightly thin, similar to BT. Dark brown in color, not as dark as most stouts.  S- Right up front the chocolate hit me, followed by oak, bourbon, vanilla, dark fruit, toffee, and some burnt notes as well. There is a lot of alcohol on the nose as well. The aroma is extremely sweet, but I expected this.  T- A lot of the same notes in the aroma come through in the taste as well. Dark chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla are the main flavors that come out. The aftertaste is all dark chocolate. Chocolate Rain is definitely not as smooth as BT. There is a huge alcohol presence and although it doesn't taste like it's 19.5%, it's still very obvious that it's high. The taste is extremely sweet, maybe even more than BT.  M- Thinner, definitely not creamy at all. No carbonation.  O- This is good, but not great. It's on par with Black Tuesday if you enjoyed that, but it's different. I feel like both of them are constantly rated high because they're great for having such a high ABV, but that doesn't impress me. I'd rather drink a stout that's 12% and tastes better, but that's just me. There are some exceptionally complex flavors in this that made me happy that I tried it, but I wouldn't seek it out again. It's not very smooth at all and just too sweet for my taste.",0.6738951646950235,4.0,0.9786
Thicket,"My 2000th rating! Served at cellar temp, and poured into my HF oversized wine glass.  A- Pours a deep, dark violet with some pink hues around the edges when held to the light. A medium sized light pink head swiftly fizzles away, leaving only a collar, and some fine lacing. Small berry particles can be seen floating near the top.  S- The aroma is fantastic! Sweet blackberry meets lactic tartness and acidity. Blackberry yogurt comes to mind. Some nice oaky notes and sweet red wine add to the complexity. Lastly there is some tart granny smith apple. Delightful!  T- The taste is full of awesome lactic funk and sourness. The tartness is in your face, though not as bracing as Blanc De Blancs or Fuzzy. The sweetness of the berries and mellow oak helps balance out the sour. There is a nice yogurt like flavor as well. Lots of funk going on in the background. This is excellent!  M- It is very dry, almost bracingly sour, medium bodied, and lightly carbonated.  O- This is a fantastic sour that tastes better than the 4.5 I gave it, but not quite a 4.75. This is well worth seeking out!",0.6871274975136304,4.75,0.9786
Coolship Red,"Been hunting this one for years. As Captain Ahab quipped, ""this is what ye have shipped for men! To chase that white whale on both sides of the land, over all sides of the earth!"" Beautiful ruby red pour that glowed in the sunlight, with no head after initial surface carbonation. Smell was the star: deep raspberry both fresh skins and sour insides, beautiful oak full of character, wheat, vanilla, wild flower, wild belgian yeast, apricot, and red wine barrel influences. Taste is way more subtle, but not really any less complex or beautiful, just wanted a little more bite like the belgian lambics do on the finish. Simultaneously vinous, sweet, tart, boozy and funky. Well worth the hunt, but does not compete with the belgian lambics of fame",0.6418330594322255,4.5,0.9786
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"2017 green wax = 4.53  Revisited for draft pour of 2019 vintage at 2019 DLD. pours thick black with no head and very little carbonation to speak of. smell is Dark Lord roast and sweetness with some whiskey sting. i do not get a lot of bourbon on the nose but i never have with the bourbon barrel-aged variants. taste is a toned down, less sweet version of Dark Lord with bourbon barrel-aging notes to back it up. it’s quite amazing. the combination of a year on the regular Dark Lord plus in bourbon barrels to give it that sweet oaky vanilla and caramely bourbon flavors. feel is low carb and thick. Dark Lord was truly meant to stand the test of time in barrels. overall, this is probably my go-to, could-consistently-drink DL variant. less sweet than Handjee, not as adjuncted as loadstar or Rrari or chemtrail. a really good barrel-aged Russian imperial stout.",0.6107532552906416,4.5,0.9785
Green,"I know this is going to sound cliche, but I want to drink this in a tree house...preferably with Dale and Brennan.  Appearance: Thick, golden/orange, hazy, perfect  Nose: Piney, dank, underripe tropical fruit, some sweetness, literally the beer to be consumed in a forest on a summer day  Taste: Do I really need to continue? Okay fine, twist my arm I'll have another sip and keep writing. The taste is initially pineapple and underripe mango (tastes in a very real way--well--green), hops come on strong with that class NE subtle bitterness that just sort of hang out in a nice way, very unlike someone who has overstayed their welcome.  Green and Julius are in a never ending struggle over my beer drenched heart.",0.6458405823473609,5.0,0.9785
Scaled Up,"Grabbed a couple bottles on 12/19/15  First time trying anythin from trillium, so I was hoping the hype was real.  Look: beautiful pour with a cloudy orange creamy looking beer.  Smell: I get peach, little bit of pineapple, a bit of pale malt in the background, but overall a great smelling beer.  Taste: similar to the smell, peach smacks you in the face, in the best way. I get a robust but slight pineapple taste, also a balanced pale malt in the back end.  Feel: My taste buds are to busy taking sip after sip. I get a creamy texture, and also a sticky feeling on the back of my throat. Very addictive beer. Take your time   But overall for my first trillium beer, I'm very impressed, and can't wait to try the other beers I purchased.",0.6484282965581079,4.5,0.9785
Black Tuesday,"Type: 750-ml bottle (25.4 oz.)  Glass: AleSmith Barrel-Aged Reserve snifter glass  From: The Bruery in Placentia, Calif. Price: $25.99 Purchased: N/A; Received on Nov. 8, 2015 Consumed: June 10, 2016 Misc.: Bottled on Aug. 25, 2015; 2015 version (19.9 pct. ABV)  To say that I was excited to have this was the understatement of the century. I can’t think of a beer I’ve wanted to try more than Black Tuesday. A big thanks to Chris for letting me buy one of his bottles. This is going to be good.  Poured a black color with two fingers of fizzy tan head. Serene setting underneath. Decent spotty lacing. Decent retention. (Sight - 3.50)  Smelled sugary milk chocolate, smooth bourbon, toffee, caramel, dry cocoa, chocolate syrup, crayon, licorice, hints of molasses, figs, dark raisins and dark plum. Got boozier each whiff. (Smell - 4.50)  First taste was just awesome, definitely warming all the way down to my gut. Got sugary chocolate syrup, milk chocolate, rich caramel, creamy toffee, smooth bourbon, molasses, black licorice, creamy espresso vanilla and light woody oak. Huge warmth in my throat. Drinks like a port dessert wine or some other complex red wine. This is warm, but not super hot. Definitely drinkable. Amazing. (Taste - 4.75)  Full body. Sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, surprisingly smooth finish. Perfect. (Feel - 5.00)  This was just incredible.

Beatification,"Updated. Last vintage I had was 18 months old. This is just 3. Poured into Lost Abbey Teku.  Appearance is a beautiful golden straw color with a small soapy white head that dissipates to little bodies of bubbles atop the liquid. Effervescent carbonation coming up from the bottom. This seems to look a lighter color than the last batch.  Aroma is heavy grass, lemon, lime, light nectarine, pineapple, and subtle earthy mustiness. Smells grassier and less fruity than the last batch. But beautifully balanced nose.  On the palate, ah yes this Beatification! Once again beautiful balance between sweet, tart, oak, and dry finish. This one has less pucker and is due to its young age. Flavors of lemon peel, Granny Smith apple, green pasture, pineapple, under ripe nectarine, lime pulp, oak, and light Chardonnay.   Mouthfeel is spot on for the style. Light body, spritzy, even pucker through the palate with a slight incline on the finish as the beer drys out.  Overall this is a prime example of the mastery Vinnie possesses. A work of balance, very puckering but not overly so. Less funky than most traditional gueuzes but where it lacks funk it makes up in other nuances that make the beer just as divine if not more unique. Which I believe is the intention.",0.70828721935516,5.0,0.9785
Double Orange Starfish,"Appearance: Pours like an orange smoothie, with the bubble show eventually separating the liquid from the head; two fingers of foam stick above the cloudy orange liquid; excellent stickage that leaves a few shards  Smell: Orange sorbet and vanilla cream  Taste: Creamsicle in a glass, with the orange flavors combining with the cream; through the middle, a moderate bitterness builds but the finish is bright, juicy and slightly dank  Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate carbonation; creamy  Overall: Delicious and refreshing; this beer is a great example of the style  Thanks, ArtAttackEd, for the opportunity",0.6817495730820483,4.5,0.9784
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2009 Vintage. Poured into footed pilsener glass. Paired with Tikka Massala. Reviewed under medium low artificial light. Taken from notes.  Appearance: Pours a hazy ruby brew with Ambar highlights. Forms a fizzy pink head that holds well. Low perceived carbonation.  Aroma: Medium high intensity on the nose. Intense sourness, raspberry and alot of funk: barnyard, leather.  Taste: High intensity on the mouth. Raspberry, citric flavour, some dark fruit manifestation, leather, horse blanket. Just wonderfully bold, intense and complex.  Mouthfeel: Very tart and acidic. Medium body. Relatively low carbonation. Very dry. Love the challenging yet elegant and balanced palate.  Overall: This is just a fantastic classic lambic, a model to others of the style, a world beater in its category. The only reason it didn't get straight 5's throughout is the due to the ponderance given to personal taste.  Additional notes: Paired great with the Indian food, as the acidity cut through the creamy richness of the food and as the fruit and rustic character dealt great with the spicy, floral character of the food.",0.7427634272321703,4.5,0.9784
Chocolate Rain,"Bottle shared by Pixieskid to ruin our palates after an awesome sour tasting! Bottle from batch #3. A: Very dark, black pour, with creamy mocha head, which falls into a thin collar around the glass. S: Nose is on chocolate, vanilla, molasses, also toffee and wood. Not too much alcohol given the ABV. T: Palate is rich and very expressive, on chocolate, vanilla and bourbon. There are also underlying notes of toffee, some sweetness, and some fruitiness with figs and plums in the background. The finish is quite alcoholic, really warming in the back of the throat, a bit disturbing actually. M: Velvety, oily, a little bit sticky, and also warming mouthfeel. O: The flavor profile of this beer is great, rich and dense. There is however a bit too much alcohol in this to be truly perfect. Thanks for sharing Brandon!",0.6753958268257827,4.25,0.9784
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Shared at CBS by an unknown BA. 2003 Bottle.  Appearance – Appears a ruddy dark pink color as it pouts into a tulip. Half a finger of light red fizzy head dissipates quickly leaving slight lacing.  Smell – Quite pungent – heavy funk and raspberry tartness, acidity, earthiness, and more funk. My mouth waters in anticipation.  Taste – Holy pucker. I’m not sure why this beer, over the other two Cantillons I enjoyed at CBS, had such a high pucker factor. Despite the age, still a wonderful tart raspberry flavor. Heavy funk, slight earthiness, sour acidity, and hints of woodiness.  Mouthfeel – Medium bodied, sprightly carbonation, finishes extremely dry.   Overall – Unbelievable. One of the best Cantillon’s I’ve had. I really don’t know what made this beer develop as it did but I now want to go buy a ton of this and sit on them for years to hope they become as they did here. I will admit, despite it only being 5% abv, I don’t know if I could finish a bottle of this myself because it was so tart and acidic. But wow, very impressed with this one.",0.6709250722218741,4.5,0.9784
Peche 'n Brett,"A: Giant white head rocketing up to 4 fingers and calms down to a solid 2 fingers with a rocky thick foam clinging to the glass in islands. True to the name the brew is golden peach in colour clouded with what I can only hope is deliciousness.   S: Sweet juicy peach with a close follow up of that familiar bret funk, sour and lactic acid . Tartness of citrus fruits and fresh sweetness with a very subtle whiff of oak.  T: Tart and tangy peach juice with white pepper, fresh lemon juice and lactic acid. Brett shows at the finish like a sucker on the tongue, dry tart and crisp. As it warms the peaches begin to fade slightly while the brett comes to the forefront.   M: Snappy carbonation up front with a dry, crisp finish.  O: This is a fantastic beer that perfectly matches the acidity, dryness and funk of the brett with the freshness of peaches and it reminiscent of matching cheese and fruit. While this beer was difficult to find it was definitely worth the effort.",0.6879100048720577,4.5,0.9784
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Got this one from stfun37. Brought this down to San Diego last week and shared it with HopHead84 and dyan. I think this exceeded all of our expectations.  Sludgy opaque black, no head forms from the pour - this is pretty much still. Plenty thick, but not as viscous as the regular Dark Lord, which can only be a good thing.  Huge aroma of chocolate, fudge, chocolate cake, chocolate syrup, vanilla and caramel. Inhaling anywhere near the vicinity of a glass of this is like walking into a chocolatier. Unbelievably sweet and decadent. Oak and bourbon are noticeable, but the chocolate/caramel/vanilla trifecta is dominant.  The taste is brimming with rich chocolate and vanilla, molasses, licorice and oaky tannins. Bourbon is there too, well-integrated and balanced with the base beer. The body is thick and viscous, carbonation non-existent. The finish is mildly tannic, roasty and semi-dry, coffee lingering on the palate.  It's amazing what a little -bal aging will do to a beer. While I'm not at all a fan of the regular Dark Lord, this iteration of it is incredible.",0.6650546873680299,4.0,0.9784

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"You can go trade your kidney for barrel aged cake or abraxas but just know there's a beer as good as them still sitting at the brewery a week after its release. Fantastic beer from start to finish infintely superior to its non barreled form. Every flavor has its moment it shines alone without becoming overbearing and still manages to be completely cohesive. Huge milk chocolate along with toasted nuts, cinnamon, vanilla, heavy cream with a suble oaky char beneath it all. Spice grows with every sip until reaching a perfectly tollerable plateau. Nonsensically good.",0.6704217652646514,4.75,0.9783
Darkstar November,"A 2016 bottle  It is a viscous, glossy black beer with a moderate sized tan head. It is very thick and frothy though, with great retention.   It smells fantastic. Carmalized brown sugar, wood, charred grains and milk chocolate, and a bit of spice.   It tastes like sweet milk chocolate, sweet molasses that borders on maple syrup, a very well integrated bourbon flavor with some oak and a little bit of spicy rye comes through in the end.   The body is decadent. Bourbon County level. It is so velvety and smooth with a fluffy fullness that is so easily consumable.   My only knock at all on this one is that it is very rich. Just a bit more rye or barrel to cut through it wouldn't hurt. A phenomenal beer though.",0.6658208788550211,4.75,0.9783
Black Tuesday,"2014 bottle poured from fridge into Bruery tulip. More carbonation than I was expecting. Pours black.   Smell - Strong bourbon, caramel, licorice, vanilla, sweet alcohol. It smells strong.   Taste - Immediate sweetness, and then the alcohol comes through, although it doesn't seem like almost 20% alcohol. Much of the smell comes through on the taste - lots of caramel, bourbon, and vanilla. Quite an experience! This is truly an amazing beer.   Overall, this is one of the best beers out there. Not what I would call a typical BA imperial stout - it's clearly in a class of its own.",0.6298339754481184,4.5,0.9783
Coolship Red,"Cracked at fridge temp and the gorgeous smell immediately escaped the bottle. Pours a beautiful reddish pink with very little head (despite an aggressive pour). Nose is dominated by raspberry. Also getting really nice notes of vanilla, funk, oak, and raisin. Taste is mouth puckering sour upfront. Wow! Tart, sour, raspberry, tree, oak, vanilla, yeast, and maybe a bit of sherry. The taste lingers on the aftertaste for quite some time. Such a gorgeous mouthfeel - somewhat dry. Overall, this is an outstanding beer. One of my favorites of this style from an American brewery.",0.6498261501499135,4.5,0.9783
Space Trace,"A: Pours black, but had hazy oily finish on top... Ended up with stout snot in 3rd pour from glass.  S: Chocolate and Bourbon in the nose--no coconut detected. Beautiful smelling beer, one of top BA Stouts smells in my opinion.  T: Really, really good but not great. Chocolate comes through first and bourbon hits next with the coconut sweetening the bourbon slightly. Almost tasted like a coconut sweetened BCS.   M: I am not sure where everyone else is calling this thick... seemed like in the mouth to me. Still solid beer but nothing on order of other big stouts.   O: Smell rivals BAA (that is a HUGE compliment), but the taste is only mildly better than BCS and oily appearance with snot took this down a notch for me. Not bad, but will try other BL stouts to see if I believe the hype a bit more.",0.592438204961896,4.5,0.9783
Green,"The beer pours a pale orange/golden color with a two finger pillowy head that is tenacious. The beer looks thick and creamy. It clings stubbornly to the glass on each sip all the way to the bottom.  The aroma is outstanding. It is a cornucopia of tropical and citrus fruits, yet there is some malt presence holding it all together. It's got tangerine and orange, grapefruit, mango, pineapple, definite melon (very pleasant note), bready and noticeable malt, ever so slightly peppery spice, mango, earthy and a bit of a floral top note. Excellent smelling brew.  The taste follows - it's a lot going on, but nothing in combat. All those tropical and citrus fruit notes are playing well in the sandbox, anchored by the presence of a bread-like malt flavor and a noticeable earthiness. The melon floats in from time to time and adds a refreshing note. It's been a while, but there's what I believe to be a dankness to it similar to hop's cousin... There is just enough bitterness to notice - maybe a touch of a resinous taste. There is also a ""kick"" to the citrus flavors that are more oil or rind like than the fruit itself. The stronger oily/rind flavors are not overpowering, which would certainly ruin this beer.  The feel did change for me as the beer warmed up. Initially it was soft and full, nice creamy feel, minimal carbonation. After a few sips, it started to feel a bit on the watery side. Not exactly thin, but it started out luxuriously soft and lucious and for me it seemed to fall off just a little bit. No sign of the alcohol, a slight spiciness after the swallow lingers and tingles just a bit.  Overall, this is an excellent beer and probably the best of the NEIPA I have tried. I have experienced the same sensation with mouthfeel with other beers in this style - not sure whether it is supposed to be that way or if it's just me. Regardless, this beer is recommended.",0.6950987406392081,4.25,0.9783
Vicinity,"Currently #185 in the Top 250 beers list. My first Trillium beer...I'm rather excited.  CAN: Acquired at Trillium. 1 pint formt with a minimalist white label and a standard pull-tab.   8% ABV. ""Double IPA.""  Served cold and fresh into a nonical pint glass.  HEAD: ~1cm in height. Off-white colour. Not as dense or thick as would be ideal. ~8 minute head retention. Leaves no lacing as it recedes.  BODY: Turbid dull orange. Haziness is obvious. I see no yeast/lees within. Nontransparent as a result of its turbidity. Lacks the vibrance and life I'd expect in a world-class imperial IPA, but it's certainly enticing in a general sense without looking unique or special. I do have to wonder if filtration would render it more attractive (I reckon it would).  Appears well-carbonated.  AROMA: Tropical fruit is the main note I'm getting. Guava, passionfruit, citrus zest, mango, subdued pineapple, tang. The New World (Galaxy, it seems) hop aroma edges out the more classic hop aromatics for dominance. Not piney, grapefruity, oily, resinous, or overtly bitter.  Suggests a fruity imperial IPA with no trace of hop bitterness or alcohol. Not the India Odwalla Ale aroma I've come to anticipate in wilfully turbid IPAs, which is a plus. Doesn't seem yogurty or milk sugar-redolent (also a plus).  Aromatic intensity is moderate. I detect no off-notes. Lacks overt yeasty or malty notes (save for generic pilsner malt/wheat sweetness).  TASTE & TEXTURE: Mysteriously light on the palate, tending almost a bit thin in spite of its medium-bodied presence on the palate. Has a very brief flavour duration as well.  Juicy? Sure, but not full-on India Odwalla Ale thankfully. Mango, citrus zest, pineapple, pale malt sweetness, orange pulp. Somewhat shallow, actually, lacking the hop pungency and depth of hop flavour one would expect in a world class imperial IPA.  What it does well is disguise its ABV devilishly well. Hop bitterness isn't present at all, but the erasure thereof seems to come with the tradeoff of losing hop pungency (my main issue with this Johnny-come-lately turbid {I}IPA trend).  Well balanced generally speaking, but not dialed in to ideal harmony. Not the most complex imperial IPA out there either, but it's not simple - just wanting in terms of intricacy.  Has a pulpy yet thin feel on the palate. Could have a fresher juicier taste. Frankly, I think the hop profile could be better. Well-carbonated. Somewhat refreshing. Not oily, gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, harsh, rough, or scratchy.  OVERALL: I'm not sold on the nascent imperial IPA trend, but this is one of the better executed expressions of the style I've had recently. It flirts dangerously close with India Odwalla Ale territory given its juice-like flavour profile, and were it slightly boozier it would invite comparisons to a well-made Screwdriver, but I enjoy it for what it is even if it's nowhere close to world class level in my book. Not a beer I'd stand in line for or spend $16+ a 4 500ml pack for, but to each her/his own.  B- (3.40) / WORTHY",0.7078517640139893,3.5,0.9782
Enjoy By IPA,"After having this beer on tap (today!), I believe this is easily the best IPA I've had so far. It looks awesome in the glass, with a nice, dark golden orange color and a creamy head. The smell is very tropical with citrus and pineapple right off the bat; the most wonderful hop aroma I've smelled so far. The taste is exactly what you get in the nose, and the hop bitterness hits you in the front of the tongue but doesnt follow through to the back(which is nice), and the flavors invite you to sip some more (which I did!) The feel is very smooth, not really heavy but not too light at the same time, very easy drinking for the 9.4%, which I couldn't even tell was there. Overall, I'm glad that this was the first Stone beer I've tried, because we do indeed have Stone beers in Texas stores, yet I was afraid to try them. This is what a go-to double IPA should strive to be like. I'll definitely drink this again!",0.6319085386273212,4.75,0.9782
Beatification,"Thanks to bugdoc for this one. '12 vintage poured from bottle to over-sized Mikkeller wine glass:  Pours a beautiful orange/honey gold with carbonation clinging to every corner of the glass. A lively two fingers of starch white head doesn't last as long as I'd expect. Could be the glass though. Still perfect lacing though.  The nose is intense, complex. Obvious funky honey and lemongrass. A deeper kind of sour, not as bright as its brothers and sisters. A great smelling beer.  Wow. Massive on the tongue. Pushing a Warhead level of sour punch. The sour intensity mellows considerably as the beer warms. Grapefruit, rich esters, orange peel/orange juice, syrupy lemonade, truly a gigantic beer. I'm blown away by how much flavor is crammed in here.  The sour side of the beer keeps drinkability rather low but its silky smooth mouthfeel is redeeming.   Overall, very glad to have had the opportunity to try this one. Sour beers are quite foreign to me and gems like these make me excited to try more.",0.6694101143850403,4.5,0.9782
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"2/20/18. Exactly 1 month old can date. Nice dark amber-honey color with a creamy head of 2 fingers.   Very lovely fruity aromas, completely full of plump juicy mango, tangerine, cantaloupe, orange, nectarine, and soft hints of vanilla.  A nice crackery-bready malt (in equal proportions) starts off the base layer of this beer, building on sharp pine and lemon rinds, darting off to juicy mango, tangerine, white wine, pepper, and a finish of green grape. The cracker and rind are left buzzing behind on the palate while the fruits soak in nicely.   Feel is crisp and clean, with a nice undercurrent of creaminess that just floats this beer nicely.  Overall, DDH Sleeper Street is one you definitely should NOT sleep on. Very tasty profile, impressive beer overall.",0.6974729053057612,4.25,0.9782
Oude Geuze Vintage,"I love 3F, and feel no other lambic producer comes close to their quality and complexity of gueuze.   The OGVs I have had fall short of A&T, but are decidedly more interesting than regular Oude gueuze (even older vintages of regular Oude gueuze).  I have had OGV '07 (oxidized and flat due to artificial cork), '08 (huge funk and fruit), '12 (brisk acidity and wonderful mouthfeel - may become the best of the bunch with time).   All are world class with significant funk and complexity. Wish they weren't so hard to obtain!",0.6585303449787052,5.0,0.9782
Beatification,"Poured from a 375ml bottle  A: Slightly hazy yellow, some thin white bubbles on the surface  S: Very reminiscent of actual lambic - a very upfront brett funk, hay, wheat, I think I'm getting some of that infamous horse blanket. There's something in the funkiness aroma that you wouldn't expect to like but it is so intriguing and undeniably complex and enjoyable  T: Wow, a little more sour than your average sour. The mouth puckering aspect in the taste of this beer alone is a wild ride. Huge sour flavor with a big intensity at the very beginning that is felt by my tongue, cheeks and roof of my mouth. The intensity dies down but lingers in the background while you notice the sweet floral, hay like qualities of the malt balancing perfectly with the funk.  M: Just slightly dry, works with the flavors perfectly  O: I was not the least bit disapointed by this beer with the high hopes that I had for it. The sour aspect of this beer is very unique for an American beer.",0.6804982874908947,4.75,0.9782
Coolship Red,"Poured gently from a 375ml bottle (dated 23Feb15) into a tulip. LOOK: Pours with a quarter finger's worth of white foam that dies to a line within the whole time of 5 seconds. Rising bubbles are small in size and high in quantity. Coral red (look it up) in color with a moderate amount of cloudiness. Lacing is thin and hardly there. SMELL: Has strong aromas of raspberries, sour yeast, and oak that entangle with mild aromas of tobacco, hay, wheat, and earthy yeast. This honestly smells like an American Wild Ale more than a fruited lambic. TASTE: Initial taste is of strong flavors of raspberry and very strong sour yeast. Strong oak flavor and mild flavors of hay enter right after. Mild earthy yeast and tobacco flavors finish off this amazing symphony on my tongue. FEEL: Light-bodied and moderately carbonated. Goes down somewhat rough. Finishes very dry. Sourness from the brew agitates the tongue.",0.6844756559561873,4.5,0.9781

Amazing how there is so much fruit in the smell and taste and yet there is none. There are sours that are brewed with fruit that taste less fruity than this.  Medium carbonation, great balance between the sweet and sour, and perfect amounts of each. Dry tart finish. Session worthy.

Enjoy By IPA,"Reviewing the Fourth of July 2016. On tap: pours a clear, honey-golden body with a bright white head with good retention. Aromas are lively and potent: huge hops are predominantly citrusy with a healthy dose of pine, and tropical fruit notes like pineapple and papaya feature strongly as well. On the palate initially sugary and pineapple juicy before an electric jolt of hippiness rattles the mid-palate. Finishes with a nice fruit-salad like quality, with some hop oil lingering to remind you of the beat down delivered by the bitterness. A fantastic beer.",0.7056257600837781,4.5,0.9781
Peche 'n Brett,"Hazy gold-amber with a large, airy white foam leaving a layer of chunky lace and settling quickly to a bubbly matt and round collar.  Smell certainly showcases brett, which is slightly funky of nutty cheese, but in a nice, measured and balanced way, allowing room for spicy oak and nice, fresh peach and green apple brightness.  Taste is very peachy--as though it is candied, or like a bright and juicy, freshly made pie filling before being cooked--with pear, spice from the oak and slightly funk cheese.  Lightly sour and balanced, this has a nice froth, medium body, and a semi-dry, crisp finish.",0.7093844715654434,4.25,0.9781
Sang Noir,"2012 project. Slight gusher into oversized tulips. Real dark with light brown thick ring. Amazing nose with layers of complexity. Bright tart cherry, berries, red grape, oak, and strong sherry notes. Strong acidity up front with tart cherry and sweet figs then strong maltiness with dark caramel malts shining. Finishes with a drying tannic note. Medium bodied and medium high carb. Sharp acidity and tannins are the only drawback in the mouthful. Really nice to split a bottle of this and really enjoy the nuances.",0.7164300499063551,4.5,0.9781
Sang Noir,"Reviewed from notes from 5/5/13.  A- Pours a dark brown with ruby hues and a small off-white head.  S- The aroma is funky and sour. White grapes, tart cherries, fresh apple cider, and tart granny smith apples are all prevalent in the aroma. (My buddy who was drinking this with me jokingly said after smelling this ""It smells like Jesus after he bathed in the Jordan.""! Possibly the funniest thing I've ever heard in reference to the aroma of a beer!)  T- The flavor is nearly identical to the aroma with the super tart cherry and granny smith coming through as the primary flavors, and finishing with the apple cider and a dry, super sour finish.  M- The mouthfeel is near perfect for a sour, being light to medium bodied and moderate to high carbonation.  O- This is probably a top 2 sour for me to date! Absolutely superb, and hard to find flaws in unless you can't handle really tart/sour beers!",0.655083293773701,4.75,0.9781

Caffè Americano,"As liqueur like as it gets, big, deep, memorable. wins on depth and feel. Fun to taste off others in this case at Rattle N Hum vs Delireum and Framinghammer.  a) Ink well. s) A bit too sweet and faint and much more caramel, chocolate and cream - than coffee.  t) But it blossoms in the mouth: vanilla, caramel, milk and dark roast, kaluha, walnut, chocolate and a whole shelf full of mixed chocolate bon bons.  f) Lands on the tongue with silken feel, velvet weighted, satisfying, think but not cloying.  o) Have to laugh at how viscous.

Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Bottle purchased by me at a long-forgotten location. Dated March 22, 2006. Served in a Struise cervoise.  A - A half-finger of white foam settles to some wisps and a thick collar, leaving behind a few stray splotches of lace. Hazy dark red with a touch of orange to it.  S - Aroma is stellar. Massive amounts of delicious Schaerbeekse cherries, some light vanilla, lactic acidity, mushroom and earthy funk, and a touch of acidity as the beer warms up. I'm shocked by how present the fruit is after five and a half years. This was comparable with Dirty Horse for best-smelling cherry beers I've encountered.  T - The taste isn't quite on the same transcendent plane as the aroma, but it's still quite excellent, marrying tart cherry with earthy funk, some dry oak, a bit of leathery brett, green apple skins, and some musty attic. It's got that great aged lambic character to it, but the intense fruitiness has mellowed out leaving mostly acidity and tartness behind.  M - Medium body, with a dry and tannic finish, and a sticky juice-like character. Carbonation was lower than I anticipated - this could have used a touch more spritz to it. I'm wondering if the synthetic cork contributed to the modest amount of bubbles.  D - If this weren't so expensive I'd buy it regularly. That being said it's similar in price to Lou Pepe Kriek, arguably superior, and is much easier to find (until people wise up and start hoarding, of course). I'm curious if I'll ever have the patience to let this sit on my shelf for five years again.",0.6717680392526564,4.5,0.978

Schaerbeekse Kriek,"600th review on BA Bottle to Flute 750 Ml C/C & Foil Wrapped Bottled 4/28/10  When it doubt pinky out. Split with GuruDel  App- When the beer pours its a muted red/pink/purple color. A lovely head actually forms. Nice to see a carbontated $35 bottle of beer. A one finger quick to disspate head on it.  Smell- When a brewery puts a certain ingredient on the label I expect certain things. This did not let me down on the nose at all. Very cherry aromatics with the sour, funk, tart and sweet.  Taste- As I mentioned with the above comment. I expect certain flavors to shin more than others and this did in spades. It was cherry, tart, funk and a little vinegar like to it. Just very well done and tasty.  Mouth- Light bodied, high carbed, tingly cherry, vinegar and sour on the aftertaste.  Drink- I wanted to go big for #600 and I have seen this at two bars and I never pulled the trigger due to $, so when a friend of mine had this at his shop I had to pounce on it. So glad I did.

Beatification,"Batch 005. Ginormous thanks to MrKennedy for sharing. Reviewed from notes.  Hazed light orange with a modest white head that falls smartly to a film.  Simply glorious blend of tangy, bright, sherbety and earthy characteristics, manifesting as lemon warheads, oaked white grapes and miscellaneous sour citrus.  Follows the nose, swamping the sense with a rich vein of bright acidity. Brings back childhood memories of Vitamin C tablets, coupled with strong notes of green capsicum. Properly sour.  Medium bodied, with mild but also spritely carbonation leading to a vibrant, puckering, zesty dry finish.  Amazing. ""Tangy"" has never seemed a more apt adjective. Had high expectations and was not at all disappointed.

Peche 'n Brett,"Split with angrybabboon.  Appearance: Hazy bright golden orange. Head is bright-white and creamy with an initial dense and fluffy cap. Drops to a small wisp of a cap with sticky sheets and notches of lacing. Moderate carbonation on the pour. Super bright.  Smell: Straight up peach juice. Obliterated and macerated peach puree. Hyper fresh and fruity. Carries a deep funkiness throughout with big pushes of grass, dirt, and old wooden beams. Slightly musty with a soft lactic element building through the back. A touch of soap. Some tangerine and super soft malt. Some cracker and biscuity white bread. A touch of honey as well.  Taste: Funky tart peaches. Hay and grass mixed with a damp musty peach of wood slathered in peach puree. Mild lactic acidity brightens it up with each sip. Hints at nectarine and maybe even tangerine. Warming lets out a little wild honey character with a soft floral backing. Fluffy yeast with peach flesh. All of the peach. The finish comes off with a touch of soap and lingering woody bitterness. A solid push of pale malt. Slight biscuity malt sweetness rounds the whole thing out. Super ripe peach on the initial sip. Super deep brett character. Old barn and stone supports. Funky Tart edge builds a little as it warms hinting at something almost citric but falls back to lactic before getting there. Ever so slightly bandaidy.  Mouthfeel: The initial sip carries a medium body with a moderate carbonation. Finishes impressively dry given the juicy peach character. Moderate to high astringency.  Overall: When peach fuzz is made of bacteria.  The name is the most apt description I've read in forever. It's all peaches and brett. The brett runs the gamut and starts throwing some deep earth notes. It's solid, amazing even, but didn't quite match my expectations (damn you hype machine).",0.6852029577145132,4.5,0.9779

Presented in a clear plastic cup which, just like my friend Phatz, transferred into my snifter glass. Appeared a pitch black color with about a finger of tan head. Smells of wood, rich roasted malts, bittersweet cocoa, dark coffee, and vanilla oak. Tastes of very smooth bourbon - rich and boozy(in a very good way), dark chocolate, strong coffee and vanilla. Completely coats the mouth with each sip. Thick and oily. I could sip on this excellent beer all day.",0.6429896557998579,5.0,0.9778

Two random litte patches of light tan bubbles linger on the surface, other than that there are little signs of carbonation.  S: Booze and chocolate mostly with bourbon and oak being second. I could smell this one the second the seal from the cap broke.  T: Lots of boozey flavor but no burn! Its intense but well balanced out by the chocolate, more of a milky sweeter chocolate, and bourbon. Hints of vanilla and maybe a bit of caramel in the background.  M: Very very thick, maybe the thickest beer I've had up to this point. Its pretty amazing!  O: Seems like this beer is a huge hit or huge miss for a lot of people and I have to say it was a huge hit for me. Its not as sweet as I expected and the alcohol is actually far less detectable than I had anticipated even though it plays a pretty big role in both aroma and flavor.

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Weihenstephaner Hefe-Weissbier - 5.4% ABV - 14 IBUs  Date: Code 1128  Appearance: Cloudy yellow in color with an expected three fingers of fluffy white head, and a good amount of carbonation rising up.  Aroma: The nose is largely a huge ripe banana aroma but the typical yeast and some subtle spices are also present.  Taste: The taste follows the nose quite closely with a lot of banana, yeast, perhaps a little orange, and tinges of spice before coming back around to banana for the finish. This one feels light for a wheat based beer, with a very creamy mouthfeel that is reminiscent of a NE IPA. As expected, there is some sweetness here but there is just enough hop character to keep it in check. This is a very well rounded and accurate example of what a traditional hefe-weisse beer should be.  Biased comments: This one has held up well for its age, although I must say that after so many thick, chewy, and high ABV craft beers, this one does almost feel watery. However, the fantastic mix of bananas and yeast help to give it a good boost in my opinion. But, the wateriness, the carb, and caloric content for what you are getting, a relatively low ABV beer, is really the only thing that prevents this one from being on permeant rotation in my fridge.",0.6950989364043257,3.5,0.9778
Chocolate Rain,"My 900th review, and I am so stoked to finally try this beer. The beer is dark brown/black with a one finger tan head and good retention considering the high ABV. The head is creamy and foamy and left a little lace on the glass.   N: Rich chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, wood, espresso, roasted malt notes, biscuit, yeasty, citrus, molasses, brown sugar, floral, resin, and earthy notes.   T: Huge dark chocolate flavors, vanilla, rich espresso, lots of roasted malts notes, biscuit, yeast, citrus, molasses, resin, earthy, and some floral,  M: Creamy, chewy, sticky, warming, and full body.   O: Oh my goodness the chocolate flavor is huge and the vanilla just makes a nice accompaniment to this beer. I definitely got the warming from the alcohol, but could not tell it was this big of a monster. Absolutely a fantastic beer hands down one of my Top Ten. I want to get a couple bottles of this and age it for quite a while, I bet 5 years it would be awesome.",0.6432288129117963,4.75,0.9778
Coconut B-Bomb,"Poured a black Stout like color with a pancake batter head that disappeared quickly. The aroma was of fragrant toasted coconut with cocoa powder and slight dark fruit. Then upon taking a sip, it was like drinking both a stout and Barleywine - very chocolately with the notes of dark fruit covered in chocolate. At room temperature the toasted coconut became far more noticeable and delicious. Absolutely no hop presence, overall very makty and sweet. The bourbon was rich at the finish - alcoholic with a slight cherry finish. The mouthfeel was thick and full bodied like an imperial stout. Overall a very balanced and a true imperial Winter Warmer! While it's the only B-Bomb I tried, I find this a top of the line winter warmer style beer!",0.68155134162881,4.5,0.9778
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"A 2002 vintage shared generously yesterday by Richard.  A: The pour is almost red rose in color with almost no head despite a fairly vigorous pour.  S: The raspberries have certainly begun to fade, but they are still very noticeable. The fruit provides a slight sweetness to the nose which nicely offsets the very acidic and tart aromas.  T: This beer is extremely acidic and doesn't have quite the fruitiness left to balance this out (but this is what you expect from Cantillon). The oak is not all that present, but there is certainly a dryness from both the wood and the fruit.  M: Due to the lack of carbonation, the beer is quite slick and smooth on the palate. The high acidity and overall tannic quality of the beer gives a very dry finish.  D: I would like to try this beer again, perhaps in a fresher state. This is certainly a very nice lambic, even with a fading fruit character.",0.7162983051937636,4.0,0.9777
Todd The Axe Man,"Look: Rich orange, yellow, tan gold.  Smell: wet fruit. Moist to the point where it makes me think of a Belgian, but without the taste at all. ""Dank"" not in the way that people normally refer to IPAs that smell like weed, but dank in that it just smells wet. But not in a bad way, like a dog.   Taste: Mango, pepper, water, tannins.   feel: Taste is sweet, but cloyingly dry. Lip-smackingly dry. Feel does not line up with taste.   Overall: I was super excited to try this; store owner said it was the first time Surly was available in NYC. it was...fine.",0.6139804390446847,3.5,0.9777
Coconut B-Bomb,"Sweet coconut, chocolate, and ethanol. Boozy flavor, coconut, barrel, sugar, strong ale. I expected a little more from this given the hype but at the same time I also thought ""Fremont is just as good or better than Firestone Walker when it comes to barrel-aged beers"". This is pretty good.  2018 edition update:  Delicious.",0.6114749542692333,4.25,0.9777
Peche 'n Brett,"750ml bottle into tulip. Second release, best by 01/2019.  A: As with every other bottle of Logsdon I’ve opened, this was a gusher. Or at least it would have been had I not bled some foam off the cap. Anyway, this beer pours a hazy dirty orange color with a fluffy and thick bright white head that faded into a very fuzzy and thick film and collar. A sheet of thick lace was left down the glass.  S: Huge juicy notes of fresh peach mix beautifully with earthy, peppery and musty notes of brett and damp oak. Both sweet and juicy, dry and spicy.  T: Earthy, yeasty and spicy flavors of brett with musty, dry and woody notes of oak. The finish is slightly funky and slightly bitter. I get a touch of acidic lemon, pear, and stinky cheese as well. The peach is there but not as juicy as the nose. There are flavors of peach pits and other stone fruits in the finish and aftertaste, as well as buttery oak and gritty tannins. Peach is sweet at times, but the oaked saision and brett balance most of it out.  M: Medium-full body, airy fluffy and soft carbonation, with a drying, lightly bitter, and fluffy mouthfeel. Drinks very well. Double digit alcohol is masked extremely well. O: One of the better saisons I’ve had. Fruity, funky, spicy, earthy, buttery and dry. I can see why this is so highly regarded. Having never had this aged, I’d still say drink fresh. The brett would develop further, but at the cost of the peach. Wish I had more. Cheers.",0.6853291447621475,4.75,0.9776
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"From notes on 9/10/15. Was able to buy a 2012 Lou Pepe Framboise for on premise consumption only at Cantillon. Heck of a deal at 14 euro. Must say wow, this is easily the best Lambic/sour beer I’ve had. Big sweet berry smell. Had a huge barnyard aroma that I like too. Tons of tart delicious raspberry flavor. Just one freakin awesome beer.",0.5852484376983759,5.0,0.9776
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"From bottle. Super cloudy pale orange. Trace amounts of fine white suspension. Decent head, good lacing. Super vibrant fruit hops on the nose. Some biscuity malt as well. Strong citrus taste with a nice bitter peel. Nice resiny feel. Coats the throat. Good thickness.",0.6880827115078545,4.25,0.9776
Coconut B-Bomb,"22oz waxed bottle poured into 14oz teku. poured a solid very dark brown color, maybe a hint of red at the edges, with 3/4 inch of light brown head that had very good retention and decent lacing.  Lots of sweet, fresh coconut at the front of the nose, with earthy malts and a bit of heat in the background.  Same on the tongue; lots of coconut, good base beer, and a some heat on the finish.  The body was smooth, full, even, coated the tongue well, and had enough carbonation to keep things lively.  Drinkability was very nice indeed. I would happily drink more. Overall, an extremely well done brew. Worth your time if you see it.",0.6626047396861509,4.0,0.9776
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Look: Cloudy but clear (Does that make any sense? You can see through it, but like any hefe it's not ""crsytal clear"") ale the color of pale straw. Proper head of dense white bubbles that sit atop the ale for a peoper amount of time.   Smell: Pineapple, banana, wheat. Some notes of pepper and spice, but the fruity esters dominate in a lovely way.   Taste: Banana and bubble gum. What you'd expect of a hefe.  Feel: Very clean and smooth on the palate.  Overall: Easily one of the best of the style I've ever had. I would offer this up to anyone looking for a proper representation of the style.",0.7141046468337504,4.75,0.9776
Nelson,"Pours a very light, pale yellow color, with a thin layer of white head. Looks like cloudy apple or grapefruit juice. The smell is very fruity and bright, with citrus & slight mango aromas.  The taste is tart & well balanced with the slightly peppery rye flavor. The hoppiness is very nice, strong but not overpowering. There are notes of tropical fruits, but not much malt. The alcohol is well-masked.  The carbonation is moderate, with mild body. Smooth & well-balanced. This is a delicious IPA. Easy to drink, tart, fruity, bright and very tasty. I highly recommend it & will seek it out again.",0.7240649090698449,4.5,0.9775
Black Tuesday,"Opened a 2012 - 19.2% Black Tuesday on 1/4/2014 shared among 3 people.  Aroma: Amazingly complex aroma. Initially it smells a bit boozy but also has a good amount of chocolate and oak with a bit of vanilla at the end.   Appearance: Motor-oil black, pours thick with just a touch of head if you pour correctly. If you pour carefully anticipating head, you won't get any. Alcohol legs on the glass.  Flavor: A bit of alcohol heat, but that is to be expected. Oaky, chocolatey, coffee, vanilla, molasses, a confusingly slight hint of something almost fruity that I couldn't quite pinpoint. If I tried it again, i'm sure I would pick up on something new that I overlooked, there's so many different things going on in this beer.  Mouthfeel: Light-Moderate carbonation with a full body. Sweet, warm, and slick.  Overall: I enjoyed this beer tremendously, the variety of complex flavors make this a unique and delicious beer. It's got about as much flavor as I would think you could possibly get from a beer with an ABV this high. I've drank 10% stouts (almost half as strong) that have tasted boozier than this beer, and that to me is an amazingly well done job.",0.6989543421565739,4.75,0.9775
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Pours a meat black with a finger of mocha head. Smells of chocolate, vanilla, caramel, roasty malts, slight barrel presence. Taste follows, dark fudgy chocolate, vanilla, roasty malts. Medium body with good carb levels. Warming alcohol presence initially but finishes pretty smooth. Overall an excellent BA stout, the fact that it is pretty easily available makes it even better.",0.6848624638852345,4.5,0.9774
Sang Noir,"Poured from a formerly corked and caged 750 ml bottle into a Cascade Brewing Barrel House branded snifter/short-stemmed tulip  Pours a murky burgundy-tinged mahogany capped by a light beige one and half finger head. Excellent retention and significant lacing. Oak, light lactic sour, wisps of general dark fruitiness and berry-like accents. Opens with both sour and sweet cherries, plums, and cranberries. Very light brown sugar and molasses join in. Pleasant oaky accents throughout. Finishes with juicy cherry tart and sour, continued pleasant oak, and just a tiny hint of underlying bourbon notes. Lighter side of medium bodied; smooth with moderate carbonation. It's hard to find a brewery in the U.S. putting out better sours than Cascade and Sang Noir is one of their best. Truly exceptional.",0.6747302246913591,4.5,0.9774
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier," bottle. 12/13/17 bottle date. Appearance: Cloudy Light golden with a thick frothy white head and nice lacing. Aroma: Strong eaters of banana and clove yeast, with a hint of lemon and wheat maltiness Taste: Rich, sweet wheat maltiness, strong fruit esters of pear and banana, finished with some clove spice and a light bitterness Mouthfeel: Moderate bodied with a nice creaminess from the wheat, and a high carbonation. Finish: Banana and pear eaters dominate the finish and linger long after the swallow Overall: World class hefe with an amazing yeast character that transforms the beer. Fruity esters of banana and pear dominate the aroma all the way through the taste and finish. Pinch of clove spice creates balance, and high wheat protein character adds a luscious creaminess to the body and creates an amazing frothy foam head. High carbonation accentuates everything.",0.7082264775256373,4.5,0.9774
Second Fiddle,Was given one by a friend. Loved it. Another friend had one of my all time favorites Sip of Sunshine with him. This was every bit as enjoyable. Both same price. I can’t favor one over the other. They are 2 of my top 3 NEIPA. The other being Focal Banger. Heady Toppers little brother. HT is number 4 for me. I live in Central VT and have easy access to all of them. Second Fiddle will be my go to beer of choice because it’s new to me,0.5045284850715515,4.75,0.9774
Chocolate Rain,"Bottle shared by largadeer. Thanks, Beer Jesus. From notes.   A: Pours a pitch black with no edge translucence. Very viscous, leggy (nice!). It has a small mocha-colored head.   S: Rich, burnt caramel, chocolate, vanilla, molasses, raisins, bourbon. Some coffee, and of course, booze. As with many other Bruery beers, this is dessert in a bottle. Extremely rich.   T: The taste is rich, as well, but it's not cloying. It comes off as a liqueur; the heavy body delivers burnt caramel, bourbon-soaked raisins, molasses, vanilla, coffee. It's tannic in the finish, which probably helps it feel a little drier than it actually is.   M: I'm not sure who these people are that claim the beer isn't boozy. Of course it's boozy. But it's not quite as hot as I would expect (see some 120 Minute IPA for how to do it wrong). Even the sugar burn I typically get off Bruery beers is muted here. I don't know if that's from the oak suppressing it, but I'm impressed.   O: I like this beer more than Black Tuesday; but I liked the small handbottle of Cherry Chocolate Rain (from cask) even more. I hope that comes around again. I don't think this is really worth $35 or whatever the cost was, but it's a tasty beer.",0.6186782377363499,4.0,0.9774
Enjoy By IPA,Well I finally tried a Stone that I really liked. I think it helped that it was on tap and really fresh. Nice balance with citrus flavors but not much bitterness. I can't remember if it was tangerine but it was excellent nonetheless. The fact that this is a iipa really surprised me because it was extremely easy drinking. I tried it on tap in Champaign IL with my graduate so it was even that much better!,0.6457671630743982,4.25,0.9774
Juicy,"Bottle thanks to ILOVESTOUTS, poured into a Hill Farmstead glass.  Pour: Deep, hazy blood orange. Body is nearly radient with color. A really nice two finger, off white head forms. The head hangs around for a little while, eventually leaving lots of sticky lacing, and a film.   Smell: Funk to start which is then overpowered by a wealth of juicy grapefruits and mangos. Some lemon zest. A deep must throughout the nose. Some white wine and oak at the end.  Taste: Up front is a HUGE burst of grapefruit, passion fruit, grape must, and mangos. A really clean funk accompanies along with a refreshing tartness. The wine barrel presence is quite evident throughout, and provides a distinct oakeyness. A slight bitterness comes out at the end in the form of citrus juice, along with a slightly bready sweetness. The finish is dry with oak.  Mouthfeel: Well, the feel is... juicy. Clean tartness that is not puckering, but very refreshing. Medium bodied. The dry finish is incredibly refreshing. This beer is a sipper, simply because there is SO much going on in taste.  Overall: This is the new best beer I've ever had. I'm not sure this even needs age, because I don't see how it can improve. Perfection.",0.6989869768058732,5.0,0.9773
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Purs a bright pinkish hue. Positively glows when held to the light. Whitish/pinkish foam head that dissipates after about five minutes to a thin white crust.  Smells ... like whole raspberries along with some oaky twigs were pitched whole into this brew. Acidic/vinegar evident in the nose.  Taste is very, very nice. Sour, tart, but with a residual raspberry sweetness. Raspberries are very evident here. Seems to sparkle on the tongue. It's really oaky/tannin-y, and there's definite vinegar/acid running through it, but the fruit takes center stage.  Lively mouthfeel.  Very enjoyable.",0.6732804554049586,4.5,0.9773
Society & Solitude #4,"Poured from a fresh growler (48hrs) into a modified tulip glass. A - Hazy IPA, strawberry blond. Pillowy head and intricate lacing. S - Passion fruit, pine oil, grass. With some warmth, lemon drop and a kiss of heather. T - fragrant fruit, sharp hop snap. Tight oily resin. The citrus and conifer seem at odds. Warmer the citrus fades and the pines win. Actually quite interesting. M - Carbonation is perfect, lemon drop recedes to tight spruce, a dance across the palate. No conflict there. A dry finish hides the alcohol nicely. A slight linger on the tart side, asks for another sip. O - Another fine hop centric brew from Hill Farmstead. The profiling is exceptional. Be ready for a challenge though!.  Cheers all",0.6723239431823125,4.5,0.9773
Green,"Green is growing on me. Originally I did not think much of it, compared to e.g. Julius it seemed to lack character and depth. However, the more I have had it the more I like it. The mouthfeel is amazing, like a pillow. It is a a big hoppy IPA, but most of all SMOOTH!!!! Galaxy is a tricky hop, it smells great, but often results to completely undrinkable beer. Green is actually the first Galaxy beer that I have liked. It is a bit delicate, if you get less than fresh can of green it will taste like a middle of the road New England IPA. I may still change my mind, but at the moment each can of Green has been better than the last.",0.6544836392225652,4.5,0.9773
Chocolate Rain,"Shared tonight with several friends. Pours an inky black without much of a head that musters but dissipates quickly. The aroma from this glass is heavenly. Deep rich caramel and chocolate with hints of brownie batter, roast, vanilla and a fair amount of alcohol. You can tell this is high in abv from the aroma, but it never seems harsh. The flavor follows the aroma but the alcohol is a bit more evident but it really never harsh. Rich chocolate, vanilla, roast, caramel, and molasses flavors melded into a high abv sipper. This would be an excellent brew to sip with a few friends on a cold night with some cigars or brownies. Thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. I/we enjoyed the hell out of this beer tonight, too bad I may never see another bottle of this!",0.6582466731287253,4.5,0.9772
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"A: beautiful red, translucent, decent head that keeps replenishing  S: tart cherry, some sweetness, vinous smell  T: very deliciously sour with tinges of cherry, wine-like flavors, and a huge tart aftertaste.   M: good amount of carbonation keeping it light and refreshing. Could age one and still have some great carbonation. Body is pretty dry and light.   O: beautiful beer, sour and wonderful in all ways. After tasting it, the sourness overwhelms the cherry.",0.6848174885782328,4.5,0.9772
Beatification,"A: Pours a slightly hazed golden color with a slight, fizzy eggshell colored head. The head dissipates almost immediately, but looking down into the glass, there's a steady stream of bubbles rising up from the bottom like a geyser.   S: A fantastic blast of citrus, lemon and funk right off the bat. Lemon zest, a touch of tropical fruit, maybe pineapple, dried apricot, vanilla and some spice mixed with earthy notes and good old horse blanket. Smells awesome.  T: Hits with a big tart, slightly acetic lemony twang that carries through all the way to mid-palate. Some underripe red cherry and lemon candy hit in the middle. Barnyard, wet hay, a touch of leather, vanilla and some oak. Sticks the finish. Intensely tart and lemony with a great lingering dryness. Like every RR sour I've had, the mouthfeel is impeccable. This is world class.",0.6590723553773784,4.75,0.9771
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Pure heaven in a 12oz bottle. Man I love maple beers and this is one of the best. Tastes of barrel, maple syrup, chocolate, fudge, molasses, and a coffee finish. And the aroma matches perfect. This is a the best beer in the world. It is best in every category. If there was a 5+ rating this would be a 10.",0.5767199641911076,5.0,0.9771
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Thanks to Nate for snagging me a bottle during the visit to Hill Farmstead!   Rating # 2400!   750ml bottle sealed with silver pressure cap.  poured into a pair of wine stems.  bottled on June 8th, 2016.  Appearance: Opaque golden yellow body with thick cap of bone white head. Head has good staying power and lots of lacing is left behind on the glass.  Smell: This beer is brett driven with earthy notes and significant Hill Farmstead signature funk. Light white wine presence and damp oak barrel. Lemony hop with a hint of oranges.  Taste: Hops are plentiful in this brew with a lightly tart compliment. Lemon hoppiness and tartness. Hint of orange peel and general has a citrusy character. White grapes and a hint of white wine with light oak character. Lots of brett funk and that signature Hill Farmstead house funk character. This beer lives layered complexity and I really dig how the white wine is present yet it does not overpower the character of the saison and dry hopping.  Mouthfeel: light bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Ample carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel with light dry notes. This is near perfectly blended and bottle conditioned. This beer shows the talent that Shawn Hill possesses. This beer has a flawless mouthfeel for a barrel aged saison.  Overall: Dorothy is fantastic and the wine barrel improves the mouthfeel of the saison significantly. World class barrel aged saison. This beer blows Flora out of the water",0.6730271701084688,4.5,0.9771
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Pours black but not thick with no head. Smells boozy but not sharp. Taste boozy with an underlying bitterness I think is common to their stouts - Cognac Masterpiece had the same flavor. Good mouthfeel - thick, although not chewy, but still thicker than many stouts. Overall very good, but short of great. For my tastes, I wish the beer were a tad (just a tad) sweeter. Two, as other have mentioned, the price point really makes you more critical. Still glad I tried it though.",0.6760773100928513,4.25,0.9771
Black Tuesday,"thanks to mtomlins for this - 2013 edition  Appearance - Dark brown colour with a small size frothy head. There is a low amount of carbonation showing and there is some faint lacing. The head lasted for around 3-4 minutes before it was gone.  Smell - Malts, chocolate, grains, coffee, wood, booze  Taste & Mouth - There is a below average amount of carbonation and I can taste malts, chocolate, and faint coffee. There is also quite a bit of booze and some vanilla and wood.  Overall - One of the booziest beers I have ever had.. but this is not a bad thing. I was expecting this to be cloyingly sweet, but instead it still manages to remain quite drinkable especially given the ABV - not that sweet at all either. Definitely a good bottle to share and worth seeking out.",0.6370146564974678,4.5,0.977
Society & Solitude #4,"Poured from a 12oz can into a tulip glass. About three weeks old, the hop aroma is still incredible. Smell is a good mix of Citra and Galaxy hops with notes of orange pureé/tangerine (floral), pineapple, and some grass/earthy flavors. Taste follows the nose but is not quite as pleasant overall with some interesting bitterness. It is relatively dry with a touch of honeysuckle sweetness. There is great creamy body up front with a refreshing and smooth finish. Mouthfeel is medium-full in body with relatively low carbonation.  Overall, this is an excellent double IPA with great aroma. Although somewhat similar, the flavor is not quite as good/balanced as Abner, Double Galaxy, and Double Nelson but is right behind them. I enjoyed it more than Society & Solitude #3 when tasting at the brewery. With just about all Hill beers, it is high recommended.",0.7186735910439681,4.5,0.977
Sure Bet,"First review written. Not a scientific numbers guy, more of a writer. This one actually inspired me.  Forget overhyped once a year BCBS, because every two weeks or so in the Chicagoland area, the mad geniuses at Pipeworks put out something super great and more limited and thus more ass tough to obtain than BCBS, it seems. I say Let these people run the IL government. Even if they don't solve the pension problem, the creative results should be a freaking blast to experience.  Sure Bet is their latest super limited super great. Behind Square Grouper, my second favorite of what I've tried of them-going on around twenty, they're easily my favorite brewery, so glad they're hometown.  This one isn't as complex and honey forward as it's older brother, the aforementioned Grouper. Much more of the fresh hop bomb I expect from Pipeworks DIPAs.  If you found this, lucky f'ing you. I went by a different Binny's tonight, picked up five different Pipeworks beers, and was still bummed they were out of this one. Sure could do with another dance with Puki the Pukicorn.....",0.5041613724294729,4.5,0.977
Green,"Picked up 2 cases of beer 2 weeks ago from Treehouse. 2 of those cans were this. I've drank one of them. This review is based on that beer.  Doesn't pour the ugly like a lot of the NE hazies do. Legit more attractive than that. 1/2"" white head on top of a brighter kind of chicken gravy appearance. Beyond the usual ""green"" aspect of hop saturation, this one had quite the blend of stuff going on, seemed like some Galaxy. Truly a blend of both worlds, there was a fresh/wet hop like feel to it, could just be my mind playin' tricks on me bc of the name Green, but I dunno, seemed like a blend of Galaxy and freshly harvested Chinook. Good mix of pine and pineapple to it.   I found the mouthfeel to be a conundrum, had a green burn to it, moderate bitterness, but also had a dry west coast like mouth feel to it as opposed to being a flat trub bed of oats and wheat (which all Treehouse beers seem to have, usually dump the last 1-2oz of a can.   While its a good beer and I definitely dig on it, it doesn't strike me as world class, but merely really enjoyable for the most part.",0.6249109320489651,4.0,0.977
Mastermind,"White head. Hazy straw yellow. Lots of lace left.  Lots of tropical fruits here, Mango, papaya, and orange. Grapefruit and some melon flavors. Earthy and green, but a nice, soft feel with minimal bitterness.   The first sip I didn't think was crazy good, but as it warmed all the good flavors came out. This was a really awesome and really impressed me. Very incredible dipa.",0.6655469009827463,4.5,0.977
Swish,"Very nice murky orange pour, nice foamy sticky looking head with excellent lacing and retention.  Smell is a juice bomb, nice pungent orange, papaya, mango, melon, creamsicle. Citrus is alive too with lemon zest and orange peel. Has a nice honey and nectarine scent as it warms.  Taste is similar to the juice bomb smell, with more of a hop resin bite. Citrus zest in the middle, nice sweet cracker malt back bone finish. Tropical notes balance all the bitterness very well. Similar to the nose, nice honey profile comes through as it warms.  Mouthfeel is creamy, hop resin costs very well.",0.6629224377318905,4.75,0.977
Society & Solitude #4,"Look: This beer pours an opaque, hazy, golden yellow white grapefruit juice color. It does not have that murky, pond water unattractiveness that comes along with some NEIPA. No visible carbonation. A fluffy white head that sits a finger high in my stemmed wine glass, settling down to a thin layer across the top while leaving a thick blanket of lacing in its wake.   Smell: Meaty and cheesy upon first whiff, with some green, dank, grassy and even skunky notes. As the beer sits for a few minutes the tropical juice notes really come out, including mango, one of my favorite IPA aromas described as crushed sweet tart candy. Orange citrus. There is a sweet bready malt aroma.   Taste: Up front orange citrus, followed by tons of berry including blueberry and strawberry. Sweet, bready malt flavor. The beer pleasantly bitters out mid-palate, with lingering notes of fresh cut grass, grapefruit juice and a pithy dryness.   Mouthfeel: Moderate level of carbonation. Super smooth and creamy.   Overall: It’s been a while since I’ve had a Hill Farmstead IPA and this is freaking fantastic. I love the creamy, candy and tropical fruit juicyness up front balanced out by the grassy, pithy and dry bitterness on the finish. Tons of berry flavor which was unexpected and thoroughly enjoyed. Complex and multi-layered flavor profile. A highly enjoyable drinking experience.",0.7029272217754736,4.5,0.9769
Peche 'n Brett,"A- Pours a very hazy and bright orange in color in the body. A head of about 1.5 fingers forms and retains for days, with pretty awesome lacing. The head is frothy and dense on top of the hazy body.  S- The peaches and brett hit the nose right away in a combo platter of juicy fruit and funk. There is a spicy element in the funk that is consistent with the flavor of the base beer. The peaches are a touch tart on the nose, but they are predominantly just juicy and fruity.  T- Starts off with a mild bang of semi-tart peaches. Just like in the scent, the peaches are more juicy and mild than tart. The spicy and funky base beer mixes in with the peaches and provides a depth of flavor. The funk picks up a little at the end of the drink and mixes with the peaches and gives an overall fruit orchard impression of the flavor.  M- Although the style of this beer is one generally associated with a light weight feel and high carbonation, this beer drinks incredibly smoothly. The carbonation is fairly high, but the weight of the beer makes this one feel way more smooth than the carbonation. There is no sign of the 10% ABV.  Overall, this is a fantastic fruited saison. I wasn't sure how I would like the peaches in the base since I didn't especially like the base beer, but the spice and funk really mellows and enhances the natural flavor of the fruit. This is a terrific beer.",0.7081018457704997,5.0,0.9769
Chocolate Rain,"Enjoyed a 2013 at a share. Split between 4 peeps.  Obviously this is a very dark beer with very little head, low carb, and fairly thin. These characteristics are typical for the big Bruery stouts.   Unlike the other big Bruery stouts, this has an incredibly complex chocolaty nose and taste. The bourbon is there but takes a back stage. The chocolate comes through big time and the taste is like chocolate milk that is infused with majestic bourbon barrel. Kind of sweet but delicious, not syrupy and a little silky. The booze is non-existence but I only had a portion of the bottle. I would certainly drink more, but a 1/4 of the bottle is perfect, leaves you wanting more and totally content at the same time.  I was very impressed, I will obtain another and enjoy the hell out of it.",0.6615924683317627,4.75,0.9769
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"vintage 2009 (per sticker, doesn't have the label, per Jean's personal attention to the bottle), bottled 2012 per cork.  Thanks to Brandon and Emily for bringing this out from Paris!  Pours a simply gorgeous razzy red. Really lovely cherry blossom caps this one. Nose carries more funk than I'd anticipated, really the earthy aspect of Cantillon's arsenal. The raspberries come through acidic and sharp with hints of vinous shreds. Flavor carries surprising balance. The tartness and buxelles funk are soo well balanced with generous bounties of raspberries. The whole thing comes together and reminds me of a freshly picked raspberry during the high sun of an August day mixed with the grit of a solid days hike. A little full bodied with reserved carbonation accentuated the generous fruit endowment for the beer. Finish made me want another sip of the beer, and a gulp of ice cold water. Really a step up from the Rose, and I appreciate the attention to detail here.",0.6549238072550119,4.5,0.9768
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Poured from a tallboy can into a pint glass.  L: Murky golden orange pour. It looks like the consistency would be pulpy orange juice. Thick foamy white head. Great ring of lacing.  S: Smells tropical and fruity... loads of citrus and fruit.  T/F: An entire about face from the aroma. This is a resinous blast of pine and evergreen.... citrus and fruit are present but definitely play second fiddle. Some mild tartness... herbal character. Great bitterness but very well balanced. Medium to thick in body, especially for an IPA. Sticky and oily. Finish is bitter pine. Leaves you wanting more.  O: My first Trillium beer and I am beyond impressed. Just delicious... smells amazing, and crazy how it doesn't match the flavor the way I expected. Really enjoyed this one and hope I get to try some of their other offerings.",0.681336849377075,4.5,0.9768
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Pour is a cloudy yellow with beautiful head of foam. Foam lasts for few min with nice cascading down glass. Smells of sweet fruit, citrus orange zest, wheat, and mild hops in back. Taste is very light fruit mix with back notes of some bakery goods or bread, mild wheat notes and finishes very clean and fresh. This is a fantastic beer for any season, I could drink this daily and never grow tired of it, awesome!",0.6533174973232847,4.5,0.9768
Double Orange Starfish,"Bottle shared by Matthew. Thanks man!  Super hazy orange body with a thin, white collar. Lovely aroma of tropical fruits. Absolutely wonderful flavor. A bouquet of ripe citrus and melons. Additional notes of vanilla impart a delicate sweetness. Simply wonderful.",0.678955694110605,4.75,0.9768
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"A - 2005 vintage. Pours a hazy lipstick red with a small off-white head. This dissipates to a thing ring fairly rapidly, but can be easily refreshed. No sign of any carbonation bubbles.  S - Big hit of raspberry, with a layer of funk sitting behind it. Lemon zest, horse blanket, sweet tobacco.  T - Begins with a mellow tartness before the flavour of the raspberry moves forward in the middle. Citric tartness really starts to kick in at the end and leaves the mouth watering into a long sour, tobacco flavours finish. Very fresh for a 6 year old beer, but well integrated.  M - Tingle of soft-medium fine carbonation and light-medium body. As expected and very good.  D - Yet another winner from Cantillon. Complex, refreshing and hugely well crafted.",0.6834134315181591,4.5,0.9768
Sure Bet,"Pours a beautiful mango orange, hazy, and a frothy two finger head of foam.  Tons of mango and other tropical notes, resinous, and sweet.  The mango is abundant with other tropical fruit, citrus, and honey.  Mouthfeel is sticky, slightly bitter, with a perfect amount of sweet and tart to note.  Overall, pours beautifully with an amazing aroma, perfect balance of sweet, bitter, and tart. Well done!",0.6767449545376188,4.75,0.9768
Haze,"Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass (1 month old). Appearance is hazy mango/orange juice with one finger thick white head. Smell is tropical fruit/hop juice that hits you in the face with notes of orange, peach, mango, and pineapple. Some light resin and honey is coming trough as well. Taste follows the nose with orange pulp most noticeable. There is a little bit of sweetness and low bitterness. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy with good body upfront and a great bite on the finish.   Overall, this is probably the best IPAs I have tasted. The tropical fruit and earthy hop flavors are unreal, yet the drinkability and balance are great. The bitterness is perfectly placed, and there is just enough sweetness. Just about perfect all the way around.",0.6800521379630358,5.0,0.9768
Fort Point Pale Ale,"Poured from a can into a snifter. Canned 3/15/17.  A: Pours a super hazy golden orange in color with a one inch, frothy, cream colored head with good retention. Thick, white lacing throughout.  S: Aromas of citrus and tropical fruits including grapefruit, orange, melons, peaches, pineapple, and guava. Notes of piney and earthy hops as well.  T: Juicy Pale Ale. Starts off with soft notes of melons, grapefruit, and citrus rinds followed by pineapple and guava. Finishes with a nice light lingering, piney, resinous hop bitterness.  F: Light to medium bodied. Super smooth and velvety feel. Slightly dry on the finish with very light carbonation.  O: Overall, this is a great Pale Ale. Super smooth and crushable. Nice balance between the fruitiness and hop bitterness. Could crush these one after another on a nice summer day. Would love to try this one fresh from the source.",0.6802659076246198,4.5,0.9768
Green,"This has been a whale beer for me so I'm super excited to review. Canned 11/17. Drank out of a Tulip. This beer looks just about perfect. Super, super hazy medium gold/yellow with tight compact head. The aroma reminds me of Julius with awesome orange candy flavors. Overall aroma is super tropical, lots of Pineapple. Flavor translates over to the palate really well but with a strong citrus pith bitterness. Mouthfeel is dead on perfect. This beer was super hyped for me and I'm happy to say that it meets those expectations...but it's not better than Julius. 98.5 points!",0.6786941185977462,5.0,0.9768
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"I actually enjoyed this beer today at the brewpub. They still had one keg left when they opened this morning. The menu said that it was 2010 DL aged for one year in Heaven Hill bourbon barrels. The nose was of sweet chocolate, vanilla, and light bourbon. The vanilla and bourbon were predominant but neither was overpowering. The flavors were nice and superbly well meshed. The chocolate and bourbon finished quite well together. It was exceptionally smooth, perfect in body. This beer was fantastic.",0.6472729121795233,5.0,0.9768
Coconut B-Bomb,"22oz (2018) into a tulip. Pours that deep reddish mahogany we've come to expect from B-Bomb with a 1-finger light mocha head that settles to a thin collar and film.  Aroma is deep and rich. Bourbon (of course), vanilla, toasted coconut, sweet malty goodness.  Taste follows nose. Such a wonderful blend here. The coconut is front and center, balanced with vanilla, chocolate, bourbon-soaked pipe tobacco, and a hint of smoke. Sweet but not cloying, just absolutely delicious.   Mouthfeel is spot-on. Heavy and satisfying but not overwhelming. Just right for the level of flavor and complexity.  Overall, just outstanding. Fremont keeps outdoing itself with it's B-Bomb beers, and this one is right up there with coffee/cinnamon in my book.",0.6928741999809434,4.75,0.9767
Haze,"Canned 8/3. Consumed 8/11.  A: Pours out a bright golden orange. Sits completely opaquely in the glass, a murky and turbid yet still vibrant heavily burnt orange.   S: Tons of orange. Spritzy OJ mixed with pithy, astringent orange pith. Tropical and stone fruit undertones—peach, passionfruit, mango. Bit of grassy dankness as well. Significant backing of sweet white-bready malt.  T: Sweet, delectable citrus juice up front. Orange with tons of lemon and lime throughout. Explodes off the tongue initially, but succumbs relatively quickly to a milder assortment of tropical fruits—papaya, peach, passionfruit. An herbaceous and bitter finish combats any noticeable sweetness from the malts, imparting a well-balanced and almost cocoa powder-esque quality to the finish.  M: Rich and luscious, very reminiscent of the feel on Green. Bubblegum yeastiness hints at a milkshake-esque feel. A bit more bitter—though more floral than piney or astringent—on the finish, but a welcome bitterness in its balance of the sweet, doughy malt that sits further in the foreground on Haze than it does in other TH brews. It's not quite as thick and full as Green, but it's pretty close.  O: Up there with anything else I’ve tried from Tree House. Haze pops in both the flavor and aroma categories, packing a punch of orange juiciness that is pretty much unrivaled in its intensity. I’ve heard Haze aptly described as a fusion of some of the defining characteristics of Julius and Green, and I totally see this. It embodies an amped up version of Julius’ orange qualities while mirroring the mid-mouth doughy bubblegum flavor and herbaceous bitter finish of Green. It’s really hard to find anything wrong with this beer, and I’d gladly drink it over pretty much anything else I’ve ever had. Damn near perfect.",0.7031332989218293,5.0,0.9767
Society & Solitude #4,"I drank this at Matt's birthday tasting last night. Thanks for sharing this, Matt!  Mildly hazy orange yellow with a dense white head that falls off to a disk. The nose? JFC. Big fruit - citrus, stone fruit, bright, redolent and resplendently hoppy. Not grassy at all. Beautiful aromatic. The citrus is more orange and tangerine than grapefruit. Fantastic stuff.  The palate opens with a great balance between bitterness and fruitiness, with the brightness of Citra front and center, while the tropical notes from Galaxy play a secondary but crucial role. Delicate but firm, there's pineapple and mango coupled with a very enjoyable citrus note. Malt character is mild, a little doughy, even. That said, this is all hops. Drying, mildly fruity and a touch resiny on the finish, this has great balance between the fruity flavors and bitterness. Medium light in body, moderately carbonated, this is fantastic stuff.",0.7270068720437293,5.0,0.9767
Beatification,"375mL bottle into a tulip bottled on 01/10/12  200th BA review, I picked a good one  A big thanks goes out to RuckusDu for sending this one over in a trade!  A: Pours a hazy wet straw yellow with a thin film of head that dissipates immediately before I can even identify the color.  Leaves no lacing.    S: Huge citrus acidity, with lemons and limes, sour apple and tart white grapes. Pear, some belgium yeast banana, the slightest degree of musty funk.    T: Holy hell is this an explosion of sourness.  Like biting into a whole lemon, then chasing it with a slice of lime.  You can taste the sour on your lips literally before it even hits your tongue.  A bit of peppery spice is there along with a touch of banana ice cream on the finish to balance out the overwhelming sour. This is just a pure puckering sourness, sourer than the most sour Warhead candy I have ever had, and it is sublime.    M/D:  Aggressive carbonation pairs well with a puckering sour acidity to give this one a wonderful mouthfeel.  Thicker than most in the style.  Quick drying finish that leaves you in all too much of a hurray to take the next sip.  Awesome.    O: Wow, what can I say?  Looks like pee, smell is good but Ive had better, but then you take the first sip and bam!  Just pure, unadulterated, sour bliss.  My favorite of the RR sours, and the most sour beer I have had to date.  I'd write more but I have to get over to the trade forum to post as ISO: Beat ; FT: first born son.",0.6292834393461271,5.0,0.9766

Head is bright white, has great retention, and leaves thick lines of lace spread out around the insides of the glass. Very dank, resin smell. Lots of fresh tropical fruit, mango, pineapple, and grapefruit. Taste and smell go hand in hand. A lot of juicy tropical fruits. This one is an easy drinker, crisp, and refreshing.

Vicinity,"On-tap 4/1/2017 at the brewery in Canton, MA, served in a tulip glass.  A: The beer is a cloudy dark yellow color, with a short off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: The aroma contains strong floral hops, fruity citrus and caramelized malts.  T: The taste starts out with a strong floral and dank hops bitterness that is followed by a strong fruity citrus sweetness. The malt character is hearty and brings a very good balance. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet.  M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.  O: Very tasty, goes down extremely easily, not too filling, good kick, excellent representation of style, this is a tremendously good 2IPA to drink for a long time.",0.7209952257354109,5.0,0.9766

Haze,Pours a nice hazy medium gold with creamy head. Good retention and nice sticky lacing. Aroma is the usual citrus and dank tropical fruit but with a strong peach accent. Flavor follows. Very delicious with perfect balance and fluffy mouthfeel. No alcohol detected. This is a very drinkable beer for over 8% alcohol. Another winner.,0.7039766924895239,4.5,0.9765
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Appearance - The beer poured dark color with a creamy mocha head topping off the pour.   Smell - The sweetness of Dark Lord met with bourbon. The nose was sweet, but not cloying.  Taste - What made this beer great was the sense of balance. The cloying, soy sauce-like, sweetness that many associate with regular Dark Lord is balanced with bourbon. What became of the combination is smooth sticky heat.   Mouthfeel - The beer was silky smooth with light carbonation and a slick sweetness. The body did not seem as thick as some of the other variants.   Overall - It is amazing what a plain bourbon barrel will do to Dark Lord.",0.6851602526257299,5.0,0.9765
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Thanks to bilco for picking up the bottle.  Appearance: Hazy golden orange with a big fluffy off-white head. Decent retention leaves a small cap for the duration. Moderate to light carbonation on the pour. Big chunks and notches of sticky lacing. Looks like most Trillium pale ale iterations, which isn't a bad thing.   Smell: Orange juice. Orange skin and pith. Tangerine. Pushes of grapefruit, lime zest, and some mango. Deeply tropical. Touches of oily pine as well. Malt base offers the typical slight breadiness coupled with some caramelized malt sweetness. Slight powdery yeast. Loaded with peach, lots and lots of peach. Some mild toasted elements as well.  Taste: Peach jumps out faster than it did on the nose. Some dank elements in the back coupled with lime zest. Lightly caramelized and toasted malts. Slightly sweet. Tangerine, hints of grapefruit, mango in abundance, and some pine oil. Slight breadiness/undercooked biscuit dough. Pineapple. As tropical as the nose indicates with a touch more lime buried in the back. Some bitterness with a mild herbal edge. Juicy and fleshy and fruity. Clean outside of the lingering bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Slightly creamy mediumish body with a moderate to light carbonation. Smooth.   Overall: Definitely not a sleeper.  It's typical Trillium goodness. The hops are deeply tropical with more lime and peach than is typical. Like Hill Farmstead I maintain it's the same base beer with different hop profiles. That's a success profile.",0.6842523331057055,4.25,0.9765
Enjoy By IPA,"Enjoy By 5/29/17 Bottled 4/22/17 No indication from the bottle that I detected, but this must be from Richmond. Unlikely that California beer made it by surface transport in two weeks. Enjoyed from a local brewery tulip.  Golden, hazy appearance with 1/2 inch head which quickly dissapates to a persistent ring. Spotty lacing. Citrus aromas, accompanied by characteristic Stone yeast note. Grapefruit, mango, tangerine well balanced with the malts. Stone signature yeast melds with everything else in a harmonious unity. Substantial body with dry finish. Not hot or boozy even as the 9.4 % ABV shines through.  I skipped at least two Enjoy By's prior to this one. Plenty of DIPA's available fresh these days. Really impressed by this vintage.",0.7031155335971948,4.75,0.9765
Black Tuesday,"MY 1000TH BEER HAD ON BA!  ***2011 Vintage***  Thanks to Masterski and F2brewers for each getting me a bottle. Not sure who gave me this vintage.  Poured from a 750ml bottle and enjoyed last Tuesday ;)  Thick, viscous, black body. Surprisingly, some frothy foam in the pour but dissipates quickly. Aroma is stellar; rum cake, ,molasses, sweet bourbon, maple syrup. Aroma jumps as soon as i uncap the bottle. Flavor follows the same path as the aroma. Fudge cake, bourbon, maple, maybe not as intense as the aroma. Very sweet and that's a lot coming from me. Feel straddles the line between beer and spirits. Very special and happy to have had the chance.",0.6015439507676992,4.75,0.9765
Haze,"Another great beer from Treehouse. Similar to the Julius - very similar to me. Exotic flavors shine through - notes of fruit, mango, orange, rine - seems to be a staple with Treehouse. Tastes extremely similar to the Julius - smooth, refreshing, definite dankness to this one, hops shine through, but the fruit definitely is at the front of the flavors. The fruit blends in and is in balance with the malt backbone.. it all works - beautifully.  All in all a great beer - didn't change my life, but was an amazing offering from Treehouse. Can't wait to have more of these and continue trying some different beers from Treehouse.",0.698176884035891,4.75,0.9765
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"757th Review on BA Bottle to snifter 750ML Cap/Cork  2001 Vintage  Big thanks to Adam for this one @Woodshop Classix  App- A very light brown with a lot of streaking gold. Not a head, just whispy bubbles in the glass, same thing with a quick swirl.  Smell- Damp and dank apple, small yeast notes and a hefty bit of funk with some tart notes as well.  Taste- The taste follows the nose and this was super acidic with an unmatched, apple like funk. A very superb well done beer. Has aged amazingly well with a nice dry oak and musty notes.  Mouth- Suprisingly light bodied with a medium carbonation level. Spritzy yeast and barnyard notes abound on this one.  Drink- 1 word. Amazing.",0.6570951707628028,5.0,0.9765
Juicy,"375ml Bottle split between some great BA friends. Been waiting to open this one for a while.  A: Lighter than expected - a tinge of cloudy orange. A gusher but was to be expected from a HF wild ale.  S: Amazing, I think only Flora has a better nose. Wine and fruit and hops. Lemon/tangerine/dry white wine. Can smell a bit of funk seeping through the citrus. Some nice hop aroma at the end.  T: Brett on the tongue. Citrus and a moderate bitterness through the middle. Wine-soaked tangerines and a slight hint of grapefruit through the finish. Complex and delicious. Hard not to gulp the entire bottle down.   M: Moderate. Not as thin as the color suggested. Nicely carbed (could have been the year in the bottle that did it)  O: Cliche to say - I didn't think this could live up to the hype - but it did. The tasting group was blown away by this one, and I can't wait to snag another now that it's been rebrewed.   If you have the ammo, definitely trade for this one. My 2nd favorite HF beer of all time, behind the mighty Flora.",0.6381821995496122,4.75,0.9764
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Ordered on cask at Moeder Lambic. When the waiter showed up, my daughter asked who ordered the raspberry soda. Me! Nice 25ML pour. And now the test, am I going to dig these funkjammers fresh?   Pour is as described, a big, bubbly pot of light red or purplish soda. Very, very big on the carbonation. Nose is a delightful melange of berries and light tartness.   Lou Pepe Framboise kicks some butt on tap like I have not experienced out of the old hip flask...or bottle. Lively fresh raspberries are juxtaposed with a lovely dose of smart, sharp tartness that never touches sour. Effervescent enough that I feel the bubbles pressing eagerly all the way up into my long-shattered sinuses. Dry but oh, oh-so drinkable. I'd work in farm fields for a jug of this with dinner.  Bloody nice, wonderfully cheerful, tasty as hell. Excellent beer. I do believe I am going to like it here.",0.6352416026671531,4.5,0.9764
Mastermind,"12 oz. Can version.  ""Lay it Down"" 12/07/18 Opened on 12/19/18  Poured out into my heady Treehouse long stemmed IPA glass looking like a milky gold color. A straw golden color with a deep white haze....opaque, but lemmony.... you get the gist. Light and thick! Creamy foam, with a whipped look, sticky-icky lacing all around. clumps or islands of foam float about like they own the place. The lacing is intricate and abundant.  Dude.. come on! The aroma or nose is unlike any other. Creamy lactose hoppy milkshake! It seriously smells like a hoppy creamsicle. Dense and sweet Mandarin oranges, banana, Fluff and a light golden malt thing combines to make a crazy, smelly and pungent aroma.   Lactose....? Man o man do I love that adjunct. Smoooth, silky easy-breazy texture with a creamy flavor that mellows out the big hops. Soft tones of primarily tangy citrus and tropical fruits that rides slingshot with the golden,grainy earthiness of both the hops and golden-style, pilsner-esque malt. Complexity is high, depth is good, but the true ""wow"" factor here is the creamy and smooth edge of both hop flavor and mouthfeel.   Man, I'll tell ya, this stuff is one smooth operator!",0.6949101976491412,4.5,0.9764
Beatification,"The label says bottled on 011012. Thanks a bunch to Bendurgin for sharing this tickalicious brew. The color is light golden. There is a small layer of bubbles on top.  The aroma has some nice tartness and lemongrass showing prominently. A hint of sweet-tart like candy could be perceived here.  The taste is full of lemon sourness in the front and the finish. I get a little more sweetness from the beer after several sips. Any oak or barrel notes are subtly placed in the finish. This is a very strong taste, suitable for slow sipping.  This is medium bodied with smooth carbonation. Overall, this is a real treat; one I'd love to have more of.",0.6865806421229674,4.5,0.9764
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"2015 into snifter.  Look - dark, dark brown. Not quite black motor oil. Good bit of foam head upon pour which dissipates over time.  Smell - typical imperial stout. Some cocoa, but not getting much bourbon on the nose... at least not as much as I expected based on smell from other Elijah Craig 12-year BA beers.  Taste - cocoa and coffee are the two that really come up big. But nice roasted malts, descent carbonation on the taste.  Feel - Smooth. Really nice. Not much heat but the bourbon taste is still present. Cannot stress enough: smooth. On a scale of 1 to 10 on mouth feel, I would give this a 7. Little bit thinner than I expected but by no means thin.  Overall - very good beer. I enjoyed this very much and it's actually a 22oz bottle one can enjoy by themselves (but don't drive afterwards). Would enjoy this again, but unfortunately the price tag sometimes prevents that. In the end, no one the enjoys BA imperial stouts will be disappointed.",0.6474094945695669,4.5,0.9763
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Pint canned on 7/10/18 opened up on 7/15/18  The color seems to be that of the New England style ipa standard: a milky golden with tints of white haze and orange juice. Opaque and thick. Creamy white dome, settles down to thin coverage. Only a thin ring of bubbly foam remains with minimal lacing leftover.   A malty scented sweetness of raw honey and golden wheat pops out for me first. Bright citrus fruits, pineapple and orange crush soda from the hops. Zesty grapefruit, tangy, sour-grassy earth in July. Tangerine and lemmon, vanilla and cream topping. The nose is simply an intense delight. Perhaps the most fruity-sweet domininant hoppy nose I've ever had the pleasure of inhaling.  A ling, lush, thick and smooth texture to the body and mouthfeel is most impressive. Certainly fresh, crisp with a zing, but damn silky to boot. The tangy, earthy bitter side of tbe fruity hop flavor hits first with multiple layers of complexity. Sweet tropical fruits, pine, lemmon kick, grapefruit, pineapple and a serious assortment of malty backdrops like, silky wheat, pilsner malt, lactose and dry, herbal effects that come across slightly sweet in the end. Juicy-dry-bitter-sweet-juicy and dry again!   Complexity of hop and malty flavor's is very high. The balance is harmonious and the approach is light and easy, even with the complexity. The hops come across as seriously fresh, green, earthy and amazingly fruity. El Dorado, double dry-hopped is a beauti f u. L thing.",0.7168731719596158,4.5,0.9763
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Big thanks to Suitcase Jon for opening this at a recent bottle share. 2006 sticker date.  Pours a light ruby red with plenty of fizz, yielding nice pink head. Pink foam erupts with the aroma of fresh raspberries and sour fruits. Smells funky, barnyard-y, dry.  Tart fruits and strong funkiness dominate the taste. Raspberry sweetness is there early on, yet it fades to finish clean and dry. High acidity, and extremely sour; this brew defines the term puckering. A polarizing flavor profile to say the least, and I love it!  Arguably the most sour Lou Pepe in the lineup, and hands down the best framboise I've had to date. Can't wait to get my hands on another bottle!",0.6512477273198245,4.5,0.9763
Peche 'n Brett,"2014 PnB poured from a 750 mL bottle I received in a trade with sonsofauerbach into a 12 oz North Coast tulip glass.  L: Delicious and juicy right on sight. A fully opaque cloudiness in a beautiful orange that belies the peaches within this beer. A rich and frothy head of many fingers on the pour that recedes into one finger of consistent head.  S: May be one of the best things about this beer, its almost floral at first. Followed quickly be juicy peaches. Followed at the end of brett mixed with oak. I think some of the floralness is from the pear juice its refermented with. Fantastic.  T: Tastes just like it smells (which if you saw above is obviously a good thing). This bottle is a year old now, and maybe it hasn't developed fully, but I still get a lot of oak and brett and not so much peaches, thats why only a 4.75. This beer is GREAT. I just don't get the peaches that much so not the perfect score here. Also, I do taste the 10% on this.  F: Well done, as all Logsdon beers are, almost champagne like in many ways, maybe even prosecco with such fine carbonation. It's light, yet sticks to the right parts of your palate and begs for another sip.  O: I'm really happy with this beer. I'd been chasing it for a month or so, and it certainly didn't disappoint. Some reviews overplayed how peach tasting this would be, and for that it was a SLIGHT disappointment, but for what it was I am FAR from disappointed. Will be looking for this years version when it comes out.",0.619057686703247,4.75,0.9763
Black Tuesday,"All I can really say is.... wow. This was a magical elixir for me... I cracked a 2014 bottle at a bible study; was amazed by the smell and struck by the incredible bourbon booziness. Looked at the bottle more closely and realized it was 19.7%. Simply a wonderful sipping beer. The bourbon smell and flavor is just incredible with a heavy chewy mouthfeel. There is a sweet syrupy chocolate undertone to this beer and the aftertaste just keeps going. This may be called Black Tuesday but I will fondly remember this as Blackout Sunday. I personally appreciate strong flavors and this one is no joke. Shockingly good. Get your hands on this one, you won't be disappointed.",0.6172528592857289,4.75,0.9763
Scaled Up,"Super fresh Scaled Up purchased on the bottling date of 12/17  L - Hazy golden orange in color. Not quite a hop milkshake but pretty cloudy. A - Tons of sweet, tropical aromas. Galaxy is very present here. Smells amazing. T - Very similar to the aroma....galaxy is up front and center upon first sip...little bit of sweetness that fades into some nice hop bitterness.  M - As a good double IPA should be. Flavors linger...sticky hoppiness. O - Another stellar beer from Trillium. Not sure how they do it but their hop game is so on point.",0.6466285374292593,4.5,0.9763
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Wow is all I have to say. Whatever it takes to get this beer do it, and don't think about it again. Opened a gold wax in the company of a few good men, basically what we call a normal Tuesday, whale slaying, gold wax from a Toppling Goliath snifter. The beer gave off the aromas of sweet brownies dipped in coffee, if that's a thing. Just understand that it was amazing, even before it touched my lips. As the beer traveled out of the glass into my mouth I began to levitate into the air, and fireworks were going off around me. Suddenly I realized I was actually hovering over my own self, watching myself drink this wonderful concoction. I recently had fresh CBS on tap, and thought that might be the pinnacle for my beer drinking of 2015, I was very wrong, that beer doesn't belong in the same sentence with KBBS. This is about as close to perfection in a beer that I believe is possible, especially for anyone who loves stouts. This is a must drink, must seek out beer, if only it was in a larger format.",0.560622742993086,5.0,0.9763
Dragonsaddle,"I'm not sure how many beers I've given 5 across the board but this one deserves it.   This has about as perfect of a balance, nuanced and complex fruit forward, very wine like with amazing drinkability. Appearance, head, aroma, taste, mouthfeel are all outstanding. I had a few beer geeks try it without telling them the ABV and no one guessed over 7% on an 11.5% beer. Great work again, Hoof Hearted!",0.6725163873378787,5.0,0.9763
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Pours a thick oily black with mild brown head. Super viscous with dark brown collar of head. The nose is heavy on coffee with notes of vanilla and maple. The coffee brings on a smokey character with heavy barrel char. The maple opens up more as it warms and melds beautifully with the coffee and cocoa. Super rich and decadent. Mouthfeel is perfect, silky and smooth. Overall, this beer is fantastic. Is it worth what it takes to get it? Probably not. Is it delicious? Hell yes. Glad to have gotten to try this!",0.6732140266574745,4.75,0.9762
Nelson,"This beer looks excellent in a glass. It pours a murky yellow-orange with a fizzing white head. Lots of bubbles streaming.   There's not much on the aroma, which is fine. I care more about the taste. At the most I get pine and grapefruit.   This beer stands out because of this flavor. I guess it's the rye that adds that wonderful extra somethin'. I get piney hops, orange rind, and a kind of dry hay quality. Also there's this greenery-type thing going on - like flowers or grass - it's good. It's very refreshing and bright.   The mouth feel is a perfect medium-light with just enough carbonation to make this beer very refreshing.   This is one of my favorite IPAs because it's unique. I'm assuming that's from the rye, but Alpine also just makes some great IPAs. Cheers!",0.6716835824892993,4.75,0.9762
Nelson,Pours - Cloudy citrus juice golden color with thick white head that stays until almost the glass is gone great lacing.  Smell - The smell is not a pronounced as I expected but still amazing orange and grapefruit stand out as well as some pine notes.  Taste - The main things that stand out are orange grapefruit and a good hop flavor.  Feel - Very smooth light to medium body very clean and crisp.  Overall - An amazing beer that I would have again.,0.6845899690705849,4.25,0.9762
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Dark body, black with brown highlights. Viscous glass staining alcohol legs. Extremely short lived head.  Marshmallow vanilla smells. Maple become apparent after a sip.  Maple dominates. Roasty. Barrel presence and coffee are there but like I said maple. Would put this at about 13.5%abv if I had to guess.  Nice and thick mouthfeel. Low, perfect carbonation point.  After having both this and Mornin' Delight I will say that i like them close to equally. the maple aspect of this guy is a little overbearing, CBS wishes it had that presence though. Thanks 4DAloveofSTOUT for the most hyped/valued/whatever beer I've had to this point.",0.650278259801986,4.5,0.9761
Black Tuesday,"2013 bottling date. I am a fan of big beers (10+abv) but I have to say this one gave me a very hard time. It's TOO big for me..to sweet, too boozy (although when it comes close to room temp I get a real nice chocolate / vanilla influence) to make this a truly enjoyable experience. It was more like a chore just finishing my half snifter of it. Glad I tried this one but all of the big hitters from Bruery just simply aren't for me.",0.5746428813549721,4.0,0.9761
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Batch 3.  Due to a friend-of-a-friend's generosity, got to try a tiny pour of this for free at a share.   The smell was room-filling mapley coffee. Pardon my double negative, but I can't say this doesn't smell pretty much like a bunch of artificial maple flavor had been dumped into a stout. We know that ""real"" maple syrup doesnt really smell like this....not to say it smells bad. Just smells like a maple candle or something. After the maple blast, huge roasty coffee. A bit ashy dark to me, and really intense. Likely the most fragrant stout I've ever encountered.  The flavor and mouthfeel though, is more in balance. Beautiful thick, not-too-sweet, complex, and boozy. Maple and coffee shine, though would've liked less adjuncts, allowing me to pick up more of the barrel and malts. I've heard b1 and b2 were more balanced, but I've never had the pleasure.  Would've loved to have tried more than a 1/2oz pour, obviously, but this beer is a fun experience for the nose and palate, even in tiny doses.",0.6485482290915837,4.75,0.9761

Forget all the stuff I could go into. The appearance? Beer. After that, everything else is just hops, on hops, on glorious and magnificent hops! The nose hits you in the face like there is a little mysterious being inside this beverage showering you with a firehose of lupulins. It completely covers your palate in delicious hop flavors like glitter off a strippers tits. At that point you're done. You know how it finishes? Hops. It's fresh. It's smooth. It's all things Stone.

Beatification,"Unexpected gift from a friend in California. Bottle dated 9/11/13, a little over 10 months old.  Pours with very little head. Hazy, light yellow in color. Smells fresh and tart. Fruity, flowery, and hints of vanilla. Wow, this is sour. What I get after that initial pucker is fresh citrus, earthiness, and a smooth vanilla oak aftertaste. This is one of the most flavorful beers I've ever had. The mouthfeel is light and bubbly. The natural fermentation yields a perfect feel. Overall I'm really impressed with this beer and I'm not a huge fan of sours. This is one of the best I've ever had.",0.6796435420344034,4.25,0.976
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"A massive thanks goes out to cmrillo for bringing this one out during his own 40 Beers* @ 40 Birthday Bash! 2007 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Cantillon taster flute. Poured a hazy ruby red with a one finger light pink head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, raspberry, tart, funk, and wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, raspberry, tart, and funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a great brew. To be honest, this was the first time I’ve tried this one. This one was really enjoyable and well balanced. While not being overly complicated this one made great use of the flavors and aromas present. No wonder I’m loony for these things…",0.696169507049529,4.5,0.976
Chocolate Rain,"2014 batch  750 mL bottle to snifter  A: Cola-brown in color, not as oily-viscous as Black Tuesday - not sure if its the added ingredients or something with the process, but the viscosity is clearly reduced. A wispy, soda-like head dissipates and leaves almost no trace of lacing.  S: The added cocoa is prominent - smells like opening a box of chocolate truffles laced in booze. The molasses undertone that anchored Black Tuesday is replaced by sugary vanilla. Chocolate pie meets beer.  T: The flavors are less a confectionery treat and more beer-like, although it's a still a decadent sip. Easily parsed notes of vanilla and chocolate are balanced by oak, lots of booze and a touch of a leafy hops. Finishes long and sweet.  M: Rich and creamy, but not as oily and sticky as its Black Tuesday progenitor.  Just as decadent and delicious as Black Tuesday, but with the added ingredients slightly more drinkable.",0.6351850798371949,4.75,0.976
Black Tuesday,"Shared this on Christmas Eve and it was fitting… it fell on a Tuesday night Definitely excited for this one and has been on my bucket list  A - Dark as night with a tan finger head  S - Smell comes through as roast, vanilla, oak, chocolate, and bourbon as this barrel really comes through. You would expect this out of the high ABV  T - Definitely the best part of this beer as the bourbon really was not too powerful. The character of the barrels balanced extremely well with the vanilla, chocolate and roast flavors. This is the best 18+% beer I have had  M - Medium bodied for sure with low to minimal carbonation which resounds perfectly with this beer  O - Definitely one of my favorite stouts. I would not put this at the top, but it is hard to improve on this beer. Would love to try the variants some day",0.634897942292506,4.75,0.9759

Very GGGreennn,"From can into pint glass, less than 1 month from canning date.  This is very much on par with King Jjjulius. Deep opaque orange appearance with good bit of foam present upon aggressive pour. It's like most very well done NE IPAs in Tree House style: ripe tropical fruity aroma and it s followed into the taste. Fruity, sweet. Creamy full mouthfeel yet very easy to drink. Well carbonated. The major difference between this and many of the other well done NE IPAs is that it's amped up. BIGGER aroma, BIGGER flavor, BIGGER mouthfeel, etc. It's perfect beer for what it strives to be and belongs in the conversations along King JJJulius and Very Hazy as the best of what Tree House has to offer for the style.",0.6718611070025449,5.0,0.9759
Space Trace,"2016 vintage.  A: Pours pitch black with a thin medium brown head that fizzles out quickly.  S: Heavenly dark cocoa with coconut, a bit of vanilla bean and nuts, cardamom, and moderate bourbon. Like an insanely good bourbon-soaked chocolate bar.   T: Rich melted dark chocolate, moderate toasted coconut, cola, and very light roast and coffee with medium-light sweetness. The taste sits on the palate for a good long while.  M: Thick, mouth coating, and a bit sticky. Full body with medium carbonation. Mild alcohol warmth.  O: Really delicious with an insanely good aroma. Flavors are extremely well integrated. The coconut still pops after over 6 months.",0.6679838125867683,4.75,0.9759
Black Tuesday,"2013 vintage, cellared 4+ years. Very strong and complex, great for aging.  Lots of big, sweet caramel toffee and raisin, vanilla and slightly sour cherry, port wine flavors. Boozy and full bodied but very smooth and mellow - some family members complained of a slight medicinal quality but I thought it was not at all harsh. A lovely sipper for after Christmas dinner!   Aged this old there's almost no detectable roast flavors of coffee or chocolate, just a nice old sweetness. Aromas have definitely faded compared to what previous reviewers say.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"This was such an incredible beer. I truly never thought I would try it but yet again, a friend came through. So much maple and coffee on the nose. The beer itself is thick and palate coating. Perfect amount of sweetness from the maple, mixed with a complimentary but not overpowering touch of coffee. Truly world class. Gotta say...trades through the roof for a reason but it's a tiny bottle...hard pressed to ever catch me trading my cellar though.",0.6184373109475532,4.75,0.9758
Society & Solitude #4,"I received this from @jhavs. Canned on 10/22/2018. Poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It has a classic NEIPA appearance: turbid, muddy-golden in color with a large foamy bright white cap and abundant, thick, lacing. The nose features lemon, tangerine, grapefruit, peach, a whiff of vanilla, and light floral hops. Wow, is this delicious! It opens rather tart with lots of lemon and grapefruit notes, balanced by sweet tangerine and other hints of tropical fruit. At the finish of the sip there is a subtle but noticeable appearance of vanilla that becomes more apparent as the glass warms and gives it a creamsicle quality. The bill of Citra and Galaxy hops is very flavorful and only slightly bitter. It finishes with a touch of pepper. The mouth feel is superb: rich and creamy with a perfect level of carbonation, and the 8% ABV provides lots of substance. Overall, I'm believing the hype. S&S #4 is sensational!",0.7082402385089379,4.5,0.9758
Swish,"A: Looks amazing. Super hazy, almost grapefruit juice color with a one finger bone white head.   S: Pretty huge aroma with a lot of citrus peel, grapefruit, herbaceous hops, pine and a little bit of papaya and mango in the background.   T: A good amount of grapefruit pith and pine and then just a scraping wave of citrus pith across your palate. Finishes with a huge amount of grapefruit and lemon pith. Some nice restrained tropical fruit notes in the background as well. This beer doesn't mess around and it's delicious.",0.6517152176426438,4.5,0.9758
Black Tuesday,"The only thing I got out of this was ALCOHOL!! Overrated stout! Not a terrible beer by any means, but definitely does not deserve the score it has.

Appearance: Pours amber-golden in pint glass, with heavy white suds but with a small head and little lace.  Aroma: Brilliant tropical hops, with citrus, pineapple, mango…absolute hoppy bliss!  Taste: Strong on the bitter note, with tropical hops yumminess emanating through. Definitely a potent imperial IPA, with bitterness lingering in the finish. A stunning IPA and wholly delicious.",0.666765029981953,4.0,0.9758
Society & Solitude #4,Can: Poured a bright hazy yellow color ale with a nice large pure white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of fresh floral undertones notes of citrusy and light tropical notes with dank herbal notes and subtle residual sugar notes. Taste is a great mix of dank herbal nots with superb floral undertones notes of citrus and tropical fruits with right amount of residual sugar. Body is full with good carbonation. Solid IPA that I wish I could have access to on a regular basis.,0.7057539557247374,4.5,0.9758
Sip Of Sunshine,"Canned on 10/10/2018. Poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a lovely golden-honey color with a large, fluffy, bright white head and spotty, soapy, elegant lacing. There are myriad tiny bubbles ascending the glass. It's as pretty an IPA pour as you'll see. It has a resinous smell of lemon, grapefruit, tangerine, onion, a hint of sweet malt, and lots of spicy floral notes. It has almost a Belgian quality and its highly aromatic. It's absolutely delicious! Softer than the smell indicates, I taste bitter lemon and grapefruit rind, sweet malt, resinous pine, and bitter, biting hops. As the glass warms, I taste more tangerine and mango. It's exquisitely balanced. It has a rich mouth feel for a single IPA with pleasant carbonation, and the 8% ABV seems perfect: it gives lots of character but doesn't distract from the taste. Overall, I haven't had many single IPAs with flavors as bold and balanced as Sip. It really drinks like a bigger beer. It deserves its World Class rating.",0.7051653192136942,4.5,0.9757
Haze,"Experiment Time: I had a week old Haze and a three month old Haze.  My buddy and I did a side by side blind taste test. My wife poured each can into two mugs and here's what we found:  First of all, it was yet another run of the mill Tree House IPA. Delicious, but predictable. Three month old Tree House didn't taste bland and dead. I actually prefered it in some manner to the week old IPA. Three month old IPA has all the flavor profile but is alot more mellow. You can taste and smell the bouquet of orange and citrus without the backbite of bitterness. The fresh one had more punch and bite, but not overwhelmingly so. That being said, I remember having a Haze a few months ago and it was too dank and dark for my approval.   I honestly think that the only difference between one Tree House IPA and the next is one or two scoops of hops or a slightly different PH level in the water. It should be pretty clear that they are trying tot dial in on the greatest version of what they invented - and each iteration has a new label and write up to get us all excited about drinking the repackaged, ever so slightly tweaked version of our favorite old citrusy IPA's.",0.5884654024199935,3.75,0.9757
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Dark dark brownish black like a sludge oil. Very gooey almost with a prevelant tan head and thick sticky lacing.  Coffee, vanilla, bing cherry, cocunut, toffee, toasty oak, and bitter cocoa. No alcohol present in the aroma, but a nice malt background.  Huge beer, delicious cappuccino, fresh coffee grounds, toasty coconut, malty caramel, and dark choclate, heavy cream, honey, mollasses. Massive and uncannily silky smooth. Slight alcohol burn in the chest. Somewhat high is residual sweetness but not coyingly so. Could drink this monster all day long if the high alcohol doesn't get you first. Nearly a perfect beer.",0.646146317440353,5.0,0.9757
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Canned on 5/17. Looks like pineapple juice with an off-white head that held on longer than expected. Nice ring that leaves no lacing as the level drops in the pint glass. Very sweet fruit smells once the can was popped, must be the DDH...the smaller the sip the sweeter it tastes initially, that sweetness gives way to the bitter hops but, there is a return of the sweetness in the aftertaste that is unexpected! A little thinner than other Trilliums but i found the carbonation to be gentle. A solid beer that I wish I had more of. Would be a good one to share!",0.6454655865881587,4.5,0.9757

Nice lacing and very little carbonation.  Subtle pine, citrus, dank lemon, green apple, and tangerine on the nose.  Taste is perfectly balanced. Lovely hop bitterness combined with pine and tropical notes and a citrusy finish.   Feel is excellent. Crisp, refreshing, and not overly carbonated.  Nearly a perfect beer right here.

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Served in a Paulaner hefeweizen glass, it pours a hazy, solid yet brilliant orange of a yellow hue. It forms a three-finger foamy and creamy head with seemingly everlasting retention.  A bevy of bubbles can be seen going to the surface from the very bottom of the glass, nurturing the head of the beer.  This beer gives a nice lacing.   Lots of banana, mild bubblegum, wheat malts, very strong biscuit, honey, citrus and clove. Assertive and enticing bouquet.  Excellently rounded and subtle.  Upfront the expressive carbonation is felt, and it accompanies the flavor all throughout.  Perfect balance, the sweet notes and the hoppy bitterness are equally present in that uniform yet complex flavor that the carbonation unveils.  Notes of overripe apple, pineapple, banana, biscuit, wheat malts, hay, honey and clove. The aftertaste is long and slightly sweeter, that crispness dissipates.  Medium to full body, slightly silky and very refreshing.   The subtleties and sophistication of this beer's flavor speak for themselves.  World class beer for sure.",0.7295375228053693,4.75,0.9756
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Pours a light red with no head but visible carbonation. Aroma of oak, funk and cherries, just as any good kriek. Taste and mouthfeel is where this really shines. Taste rich of cherries, oak and funk back up the cherries nicely. Tart like no other I've had, mouth puckering in the best way possible. This is a real treat",0.6675127442358161,4.5,0.9756
Green,"Stoked to finally try Treehouse. This gem was canned 10 days ago.  Darker than I was expecting. Muddled hop juice, just the way I like it.  Smell isn't powerful. Little citrus and tropics coming off.  It's good, not what I was expecting, but good. Sweetness and tropics up front followed by the faintest bitterness. I think it's the way the malt plays with the Galaxy. Just not a huge fan. It's a solid beer though, reminds me of Focal Banger. Also, drinking this next to a Swish and DDH Congress St makes it harder to compete with than against a Heineken. Looking forward to trying more from the Beer Advocate powerhouse. Haze and Bright w Citra are up next.  Great mouthful. Smooth and I just want more despite the taste not being my favorite.  Overall, a pretty delicious beer. Not a 100 by any means IMO, but I'd drink it all day long if I could.  87/100",0.624989731281159,4.25,0.9756

Little to no lacing.  S: Impressive. Heavy fruity peach notes with a lot of geueze character. Funky and lightly acidic. Doesn't get any better.  T: Strong but balanced sour. Good amount of peach character. Lemon acid character and horse blanket. Oakey but overall could be more complex.  F: Nice tart and dry. Very clean but not too puckering. Could be more full.  O: This met my expectations. I have to put ddg ahead of this just on complexity but this is a solid beer worth seeking out. I'd like to try this fresh but a little age has been solid.

Taste is what you want in this type of beer fresh, smooth and pleasing. No faults can't say too much bite or too fruity just right! Good feel carbonation is there not overpowering. The balance to this beer is what makes it what it is. It is right on every level.

Chocolate Rain,"Blurring the lines of what is ale and what is a barley liqueur, Chocolate Rain is a spell-binding elixir that mesmerizes the taste buds with its succulent and savory dessert-like properties. Even with its ridiculous alcohol, one decadent taste and she'll have you under her spell for hours.  As the beer crawls around in the glass, its would-be onyx-black appearance is shed upon by shades dark brown mocha. A gentle swirl leaves a sprinkle of cocoa on the glass along with an inky and rusty haze. Light on any head character, the ominous ale prefers brandy-type legging over any Belgian lace.  Savory richness exudes from the snifter as the olfactories become awash with fudge-type chocolate, brownie batter and sweet liquor. With a stern scent of port and sherry, its roasted ""stout"" character, in all its espresso and toasted glory is somehow dwarfed by the immense dark chocolate overtones.  Its taste is nothing short of decadent as its rich chocolate and mocha flavor simply melt the palate, the heart and the soul. It's an absolute culinary delight as the roasted espresso flavors are trumped with all that fuggy, brownie, ooey-gooey richness. As soon as the ale becomes too much, the rise of bourbon-like sweetness, sherry-like tartness and port-like savory notes become almost ""meaty-rich"" like teriyaki. Finishing long and strong, its flavor hangs onto the palate like tiramisu.   Its absurdly full body is chewy, mouth-coating as the ale coats the palate with a dense film. The Bruery might as well serve it up with a fork and knife. But all that clinging cloying texture ensures a long and savory reward as the beer's thickness is only tempered by buttery and acidic alcohol heat.  The front of its label reads, ""contains alcohol"" - ya think!? Chocolate Rain is a most decadent ale-sipping experience- especially for chocoholics like me. I'm sold!",0.6558418568679529,4.75,0.9755
Nelson,"L: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a bright yellow color and a cloudy consistency. There was a small amount of foamy head that lasted an average amount of time. Fantastic lacing.  S: A sweet, alluring aroma of hops, citrus, and other light fruits.  T: Tasted of a good amount of hops, some rye notes, light malt, citrus (grapefruit), mango, and some other tropical fruits. A balanced flavor that's not too hoppy or too sweet. Very fruity and focused.  F: A well-carbonated beer with a somewhat slick finish. Light-bodied.  O: This is another excellent West Coast IPA. It's quite well made and definitely easy to drink.",0.6950909187232804,4.5,0.9755
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"A: Poured a very nice reddish pink with a beautiful pink-hued head that lasted throughout the glass.  S: Lots of raspberries in this vintage with a nice bit of sweetness from the raspberries paired with a bit of tartness and quite a bit of lactic acid, seemingly much more so than in the LP Kriek.   T: Quite tart with a bit of sweetness. Not much acetic acid, not getting any vinegar taste like with Saint Lamnivus. Much more on the lactic side of things. Not much funk, but overall very delicious.  M: Very nice. I've gotten quite used to all types of sour, but this one actually stung my tongue quite a bit. Lots of carbonation.  D: Extremely drinkable. Low abv, very complex, and an all-around nice sipper.",0.6660030832409488,4.5,0.9755
Sure Bet,"22 ounce bottle, batch #573-574 into a snifter, some into a teku glass.  Pours a bright, hazy, apricot color. Small, but thick head that dissipated quickly, lots of foamy lacing. Fresh, citrusy hop smell up front, followed by a big mango blast. Some malt, a bit musty, a bit bready. Big, delicious mango taste, balanced with citrusy hops- lots of grapefruit. Some malt, not a lot. Not really picking up the honey, not a sweet beer. Dank Mosaic hops show on the back end. Smooth, solid body, refreshing.  Top notch beer from Pipeworks, and it's a real toss up if it's better than it's parent, Square Grouper. I think I'd go with this. So well balanced, all the pieces fit together well. Will buy any time it comes around.",0.6906598003133204,4.5,0.9754
Sang Noir,"Look: very light head, mahogany in color with tints of blood red  Smell: sour funk, cherry and a strong barrel presence   Taste: sour up front with a sweet cherry flavor, from there it develops into an barrel with sour cherry taste  Feel: great tartness, super smooth leather, medium body   Overall: an excellent beer, we'll worth the money... one of the best sours I've had",0.6801125320344569,4.5,0.9753
Beatification,"My own personal white whale that I finally was able to come across from the latest release. Bought 6 and plan on opening up a bottle every year to see the change it goes through.  A - Golden, head sort of quickly disappates which I was surprised with but fine by me. S - Major funk going on and really can smell a barrel presence. Smells immensely citrusy and earthy. T - Follows the nose and man, this is DAMN delicious. My mouth was watering the entire time and the only thing to quench was more of this beauty. M - Quite carbonated even though the head disappeared quickly. Lasting carbonation that I would imagine will fade in time but will allow other flavor aspects to come through moreso. Overall was extremely happy to pop this open via Facetime with my buddy who waited in line for me to acquire them. Is it the best Lambic I've ever had?

Peche 'n Brett,"A-Cloudy orange, two finger head, leaves nice lacing.  S-Holy peaches! Perfect amount, not artificial at all. Tad bit of oak and grass.  T-Not as sour as I was expecting, still tart though. Great deal of peaches, a little too much for my tastes.   M-Medium bodied and nicely carbonated.  O-A tad bit more sour notes and this could be perfect. Easily the best peach beer on the market.",0.6696539227111188,4.5,0.9753
Black Tuesday,"The beer pours out in a dark brown color, black in the glass with some brown, reddish hues coming through the edges in the light.  The aroma hits of huge sweetness. Marshmallow, vanilla, coconut, bourbon, milk chocolate. Lots of alcohol heat. Almost like a bourbon and sweet chocolate/coffee liqueur.  The flavor follows with that rich sweetness up front. Bourbon, sweet brown sugar, caramel, some bitter chocolate and coffee. This is followed with lots of vanilla, toasted coconut, oak. Alcohol burns as it goes down, but the beer is not very alcohol forward on the palate as sweetness dominates.  Great barrel complexities, but the beer is generally very sweet. A still complex and incredible beer.",0.6363722874329386,4.75,0.9753
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Classic, best enjoyed in the beer garden at the brewery. Nothing special in the look, just a nice clear amber. Smell is OK but nothing striking.

Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Poured from a 750mL bottle dated April 28, 2010 into a Duvel 0.5L tulip.  A: Tons of loud fizzy carbonation forms a pinkish head, which fades quickly into a wispy lacing. Body is a beautiful deep ruby hue. There is not much lacing, but I still think it looks great.  S: Cherry aromas foremost, with a wonderful sourness and slight bit of funk.   T: Powerfully sour, but less funk than I'd hoped. Wonderful complex fruit aftertaste.   M: Less carbonation than the pour suggests. Mouthfeel is fairly thin, and absolutely puckering from the sourness.  O: Overall, I think I am drinking this beer too young maybe. I was expecting more brett complexity. The fruit flavor is great, but the sourness could be overshadowing the other flavors.",0.678417857415776,4.0,0.9753
Beatification,"Got a bottle of this in July of 2017 when my best friend Jon and I visited the brewery when I went to visit him in northern California where he lives. This particular bottle was bottled on 2/15/17. Been holding onto this until tonight. Decided tonight is the night to finally drink this one. Poured out the bottle I just uncorked into my tulip glass, this beer pours a fairly cloudy/hazy light golden color with a good amount of little bubbles rising to the beer's surface. Has a nice white head that's about an inch thick when first poured that settles eventually to a medium sized ring lining the inside of the glass. Not much lacing here though. Aromas of some bready malts along with sour, musty, barnyard funk and oak notes along with a hint of citrus fruit. The taste follows suit, with some bready malts along with sour, musty, barnyard funk and oak notes along with a hint of citrus fruit and some green apple tartness. A very nice flavor profile overall indeed. Has a fairly crisp and slightly prickly, yet also smooth, medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish with a nice sour and slightly dry aftertaste. Very easy to drink in teh way well crafted beer ought to be.  Eric",0.6706704794593751,4.5,0.9753
Chocolate Rain,"2013 bottling  A: Poured into a snifter to a deep black with a small tan head that fades to a collar around the edge of the glass leaving minimal lacing S: Smells of chocolate and bourbon barrel influence with notes of caramel and vanilla. Good bit of alcohol on the nose as well with some slight oak T: Taste is lots of chocolate with some alcohol, some slight caramel and vanilla with a hint of oak. After warming up there's some coffee and light roasted malt notes as well. Swallowing this one brings on even more layers of delicious chocolatey goodness. Lingering bourbon notes as well.  M: fairly big in the mouth with soft carbonation and a drying finish from the alcohol. O: Absolutely incredible. Easily one of the best beers I've ever had.

Society & Solitude #4,"Split with Goblinmunkey7, growler filled a couple hours ago  Consumed 8/29/15  A: Medium tangerine, with some golden honey - glows in the light - hazy, cloudy, with some clarity around the edges - medium sized, fluffy, off-white head, fades to a mostly solid, wispy cap, leaves some streaks and blobs of lacing  S: Stunning? Paralyzing? Magical? I have been smelling this for a while, and I can't get over it - fresh squeezed, ripe tropical fruit juice - bright, bright orange, tangerine, and grapefruit juice, flesh floral citrus - tons of stone fruit, ripe peach flesh, peach juice, apricots - massive tropical push, with mango, pineapple, and passion fruit - fruity - straight-up hops, hop resin, pine, and a touch of mint - herbal notes - pale malts at the base, extremely clean, no hints of alcohol  T: Juicy, fruity, big - massively hoppy, which is not a surprise - orange, tangerine, grapefruit, ruby red grapefruit - citrus, juice, flesh, and some oil, zest - an array of stone and tropical fruits - peach flesh, apricot, pineapple, mango, passion fruit - hop resin, pine, and some herbal flavors - moderate bitterness that tastes a little more herbal and grassy than expected - clean. pale malts, lightly sweet, touch of caramel, finishes clean  M: Medium body, very smooth, excellent carbonation, finishes clean  O: Can I actually drink this with my nose?  I'm slightly confused by some of the other reviews I am now skimming through, as they suggest that the aroma is not potent. Maybe this quickly fades over time, or maybe this batch is just hyper fresh. Regardless, this is one of the best smelling IPAs I have had in a long time. It's magical. Even compared to other Hill Farmstead DIPAs, this is notable. The taste does not quite fulfill the promises of the aroma, but it's still very lovely.",0.680424795893963,4.25,0.9752
Chocolate Rain,"Picked this up in a great trade with Mike! 2013 vintage. Pitch black pour with a quickly fading one finger caramel-colored head with minimal lacing. The nose is huge chocolate fudge and booze, along with hints of vanilla, dark fruit, dark chocolate, and did I mention booze. The taste is bold and super rich with once again, lots of booze. Hints of vanilla, oak, dark fruit, maple, molasses, espresso, caramel, leather, tobacco, and milk chocolate. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with low carbonation and a great warming finish. It approaches cloying, and it's definitely a sipper, but still incredibly drinkable for such a big beer. Overall, yes, it's hot and boozey, but it's so good! Much more upside than down. Highly recommended!",0.6576169310605536,4.5,0.9752
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2006 Vintage on draft.  Pour: Ruby red, slightly oily looking body with a bright pink 2 fingered, prickly carbonated head.   Nose: Very tart raspberries (not quite fully ripened), musty oak, slight barnyard funk, vinegar, red wine and lemon juice to round it out.  Taste: BAM! You've just been punched with a raspberry fist...right down your throat! Seriously tart raspberries, slight lemon juice at first, followed by slight oak and barnyard flavors that can't defeat the initial raspberry tartness. Finish is slight sweetness from the fruit along with hints of red wine and vinegar.  Mouthfeel: Perfect for this style. Light and crisp, slight prickly carbonation just below being oily. Perfect body in my opinion.  Overall: Fantastic. This is my idea of a perfect sour at the top of my list. Hope to find a bottle.",0.6697130143330099,4.5,0.9752
Enjoy By IPA,"This had a surprisingly light body, which is really not what I wanted or expected from this. This was the first enjoy by that I have ever had, and maybe it's due to high expectations, but this beer fell short for me. Honestly I had this with another beer because I was like ""Really? This is it?"" and wanted to compare to something I've had multiple times before. After thinking about it though, I realized I just didn't like this much. It looks great, and smells even better, but the taste and mouthfeel were really lacking for me. I ended up pouring out probably 4-6 ounces of it.",0.5978841183340033,3.75,0.9752
Black Tuesday,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into a footed glass. Vintage 2013. From notes. Reviewed 15 November 2013.  A: Less black than I'd expected. Coca-cola glints in direct light. No head.  S: Boozy as hell. Bourbon -- sure, sharp, and almost harsh.  T/M: Holy god, this is as good as any beer I've ever tried. Molasses, fudge, caramel, winter berries, bourbon, brown sugar, hint of booze. The mouthfeel is almost a letdown, with prickly alcohol and loads of sugar. Is it too sweet? Maybe. Maybe. But that's poking holes in perfection. Rich, luxuriant, and infinitely rewarding.  O: This is an absolutely incredible beer. Highest recommendation. Is it the absolute best beer ever? Not quite. Maybe close. But not quite. Slightly too sweet and too boozy.",0.6218744361664511,4.75,0.9751
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Many thanks to Patrick for sharing this at his birthday tasting!   A: like black coffee, very slight head, leaves minimal legs on the side of the glass  S: maple syrup, maple syrup, and more maple syrup; lots of bourbon barrel, slight bourbon sting, slight coffee and chocolate...did I mention maple syrup?  T: maple syrup, coffee, chocolate, not as much bourbon taste but slightly hot bourbon sting; tastes like a candied maple chocolate candy dipped in a mocha; lots of coffee aftertaste that lingers on the tongue along with a slight bourbon sting; amazing  M: sweet without being cloying; well carbed  O: if it were a perfect world, everyone would have multiples of this and drink one now and age one. On one hand, all the flavors are there and well balanced. However, six months would smooth out that slight hotness and temper the maple syrup.

Nelson,"Bomber with best by date exactly 60 days into the future. Not sure when this was born, but seems relatively fresh. Cloudy, golden hue with foamy, white head. Looks to be well carbonated.  Smells piney, with strong citrus notes. Grapefruit mostly. Mouthfeel is rather chewy and finishes dry. Clean finish, but not quite crispy. Flavors are bold grapefruit with some pine undertones. Really refreshing and clean ipa. No signs of the alcohol, just a lot of citrus and medium bitterness that grows to the finish.  Overall and excellent, easy drinking ipa. I haven't had a lot of the Alpine beers, but I'll be seeking them out.",0.7139816041223528,4.25,0.9751
Green,"Wow, my first sip of Treehouse lives up to all the hype.   L: Pours a beautiful light gold with a thick haze from the flaked oats and oddly, almost no head.   S: Smells incredible. Certainly grapefruit and hops. I can smell the tangerine they mention on the can as well.   T: Taste is absolutely delicious. Very fruity with grapefruit and tangerine up front. Piney hops (but not overloading) and maybe a touch of peach and pineapple in the background. Invigorating and juicy as if there was fresh fruit in the glass.   F: Feel is juicy and refreshing with a bit of over-carbonation, probably to accommodate for the flaked oats. Finish is dry and crisp like you just took a bite of an apple. Almost finishes like a hard cider.   I would drink these in the summer and probably choose it over Bissell Bros Swish to be truthful.",0.6604989467322535,4.5,0.975
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Poured into a Duvel glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. This was bottled 26 Apr, 2011.  Appearance: As poured the beer is a dark, almost purple, red with a 1/8” irregular head surrounded by a ring around the inside of the glass. The head soon recedes leaving the ring and a few isolated patches of foam on the surface. Sipping leaves behind lots of leggy lacing, most of which clings to the sides of the glass.  Smell: When the bottle is opened the aroma of tart cherries is detectable almost immediately. The oak remains well behaved in the background and contributes a touch of wood and vanilla. The characteristic funk associated with the Brett has not yet emerged or taken over this beer.  Taste: The flavors are predicted well by the nose, with lots of tart cherry flavor (and a nice mouth pucker to go with it). Some woody oak and vanilla come in about midway through and there is a touch of sweetness to round things out before the finish.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is on the light side of medium bodied and the light, persistent carbonation leaves a gentle clean, crisp prickly feel. The finish is long and ends reasonably dry along with a persistent tart “pucker” in the back of the mouth.  Drinkability and Overall Impression: This is a very nice beer to sip and enjoy. At the price of this bottle I’ll probably not be sampling this one very often, but I certainly intend to have it again. Everything here is clean and crisp and I can easily see why many prefer their fruit lambics on the young side before the Brett and funkiness take over. I also think that the variety of cherries used does differentiate this from Kriek’s made with other tart cherries. On the label it describes these cherries as being prized by the makers of Kriek. I understand that now and it isn’t hyperbole.",0.6737141624653171,4.5,0.975

Beatification,"Batch 5 - and might I add finally! A huge want for so long. I'm gonna enjoy this.  Opaque and golden, like a hefe, but without the billowing head. Light clings of lace. Nose is full of earthy funk, chedder cheese (yes cheese), damp wood, citrusy lemon.  This truly has sour power, perhaps one of the most sour beers I've had. But wait it has balance too! Right off the bat lactic sourness hits you, then a very grungy earthy quality to the taste, with grass and hay. Citrus and lemon lift, more sour. The finish is puckering. Lots of that russian river pedigree from there great oak barrels. I suppose we could call that terrior. Scrubbing bubbles sourness, DRY, lingering lactic finish, just amazing. One of the few beers I've had that is worth the hype, 'nough said.",0.6491065980821549,5.0,0.975
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Pours a bright and shiny black color. Completely opaque and oily. Almost no head whatsoever, but there is a small ring of tan foam along the outside of the beer.   Aroma has notes of wet musty oak, bourbon, roasted malts and a touch of grains. Lots of that musty oaky aroma on the nose - not much else comes through.  Taste has notes of roasted malts with a hint of smokiness, light grainy notes, bourbon, oak, toasted marshmallow, chocolate, and a touch of earthy bitterness or char on the back end. This beer is really lovely once it warms up. Lots of levels of flavors to be found in this beer. Bit of bakers chocolate is noted, but its light.   Feel is medium bodied, but kind of sticky making it punch above its weight. Surprisingly prickly carbonation for a barrel aged beer.   Overall a well crafted, outstanding BA stout. However for me personally, I prefer the non-BA version which is a near perfect Russian Imperial Stout.",0.6747844012901537,4.25,0.975
Double Orange Starfish,"look: Dull orange peel color, cloudy, hazy, soft 1-2 finger head from a light, non-vigorous pour smell: Orange forward, little mango, tropical fruit on nose, not too strong taste: Soft, pillowy light bitterness. Orange flavor is primary, not too sweet. feel: thick enough but not overwhelming, medium for a NE double  Overall: I really like this beer, a lot. Super picky esp in this genre, but this is basically what you wish you'd get when you order a NEDIPA. Very tasty. Attained in a trade, very fresh. Highly recommend, so far the best I've had from Aslin.",0.6883498978267164,4.5,0.9749
Second Fiddle,"L: a very clear golden yellow with a huge head when poured into a can glass.   S: Wonderful citrus smell - also some tangerine and orange. Very sweet. Aroma very similar to HT, remarkably so.  T: Very hop-forward, with a distinct flavor of pine. Not as bitter as some VT Doubles. I'll agree with other reviewers that there's a dry aftertaste.  F: Very low carbonation and very clean. Although there is bitterness in the taste, this beer is remarkably smooth to drink, possibly more so than many other of its kind.   O: A strong Vermont double IPA. Definitely on the same pillar as the Alchemist HT and Lawson's SoS, but I found those two to have a better overall aroma and taste. Second Fiddle has probably the best mouthfeel of them all. Basically, like those beers though, if you see it, grab it!",0.6718827091947756,4.5,0.9749
Coconut B-Bomb,"A 22 fl. oz. bomber, 2018 release. Poured into a snifter glass.  Appearance: Dark dark brown in colour with a thin brown head that dissipated quickly, but left some spotty lacing.  Aroma: Roasted malts, coconut, chocolate, vanilla and molasses with hints of oak and bourbon.  Taste: Roasty, moderate sweetness, bourbon, chocolate, coconut, vanilla, oak, a touch of booze and hints of molasses.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, full bodied with soft carbonation.  Overall: Nice sipper, but it got too sweet as it became warmer. I easily preferred Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb which I thought was near perfect, over this version.",0.6421460306634001,3.75,0.9749
Beatification,"A- Bright golden orange with a beautiful head, but that quickly dissipates and leaves almost no head. There is, however, plenty of active bubbles.  S- Funky, fruity, oak, wine.   T- This one is REALLY sour. Does have a lot of other flavors going on, as well, but this very well could be the most sour beer they make. The oak is definitely present, along with some fruit (cherries, pineapple, I think) and some funk. Again, VERY sour.  M- Maybe my favorite aspect of this beer. Unbelievably smooth despite the extreme flavors. Carbonation is medium low which works perfectly and give it a creamy mouthfeel.  O- The hype is well deserved.

Vicinity,"appearance is what youd expect from a trillium IPA, basically looks like orange juice with a tight and thin white head that leaves a rim around the glass.   Pineapple, orange, peach, citrus, pine, and medicinal dankness on the nose. Also picking up a strong sweetness reminiscent of honey.   taste definitely follows nicely - opens with a huge blast of candied tangerine and orange, citrus zest, peach, mango and pineapple showing up as well. A subtle bitterness coming through on the finish. Very little cracker malt presence, almost nonexistent but still adds something to the beer. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, medium bodied which makes this too easy to pound.  Overall not a very balanced IPA but as a galaxy fan im absolutely loving this. Straight up juice bomb!!",0.6784281218901344,4.75,0.9747
Green,"Canned 10/27/16 with ""Cubs or Indians"" on the bottom of the can; pours very cloudy yellow gold color with a 1 finger cloudy white head that faded slowly and left really good lacing. Looks like a glass of grapefruit juice.  Smells of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, biscuit, tangerine, floral hops, lemongrass, faint caramel, fresh cut grass, pineapple and biscuit with some more orange at the end to make it light and airy.  Tastes of potent bitter orange juice, lemon, pineapple, clementine, guava, toasted grains, grape soda, piney hops, fresh cut grass and a mix of weed and caramel sweetness. Really well balanced and pretty damn close to perfect in it's complexities. Great stuff.  Mouthfeel was crisp yet creamy and smooth, with a slight bitterness, lots of toasted grains and a semi-clean finish with lots of hops and malt as it fades. A simply delicious beer, thanks Chris D for sharing.",0.6683583098969194,4.75,0.9747
Haze,"My first experience with this long-time whale! Canned on 5/16/2018 and poured into pint glass. It pours a hazy, dirty golden yellow color with a half finger of milk white head that dissipated slowly leaving a thin sheen of creamy lacing. The smell didn't pop as much as I anticipated but it nonetheless is fragrant with lemon, tangerine, vanilla, pine needles, and floral hops. The taste is everything I'd hoped for: a perfect balance of lemon, grapefruit, tangerine, lactose, and a delicious blend of hops that's bitter without biting. This is as easy a drinking DIPA as you'll ever find. It's creamy with a near perfect level of carbonation. And it goes down so smooth I can't believe it's 8.2% Overall, Haze is simply exquisite.

Todd The Axe Man,"Fantastic beer fresh, although definitely super expensive for an IPA. Paid $16.99 for a 4 pack. Nose and taste is nothing but hop bomb. Pungent mosaic and citra goodness. Be warned however that this beer falls off fast. Significant flavor changes by week 6. I'm a freshness fanatic, and consider 6 weeks to be ""old"", but most beers still retain their goodness, just less of it, at 6 weeks. This beer actually changes, as the malt seems to morph and the hops pull back. Great beer, but drink quickly.",0.5922999594934553,4.75,0.9747
Scaled Up,"Look: Turbid, yellow, nice head with lots of lacing Smell: Big orange, a little peach or tropical like smell Taste: Tangerine, orange, starts lightly sweet, but ends with a nice pleasant bitterness that lasts, slight citrus finish, with a very sligh alcohol flavor, as it warms some resin ad hop spiciness come through Feel: creamy like mouthfeel, leaves resiny like coating on the tongue.

Green,"This was one of those beers that I've been lucky enough to sample multiple times in the line at Other Half. Many probably consider this to be the standard for IPA's from this neck of the woods, and it's quite easy to see how! Tasty, smooth, and easy to drink, it's nearly impossible not to like this once the initial hit of the hops and citrus takes hold.  Such a fabulous pour and look to this beer as the beer had an extremely opaque and dank pineapple hue to it with a bit of sediment floating around the bottom. The date was partially hidden on the bottom of the can but this was from this year and smelled and tasted fresh as ever. Loads of citrus, melon, stone fruit, and Mosaic hops in the nose with all of those present in the taste as well. Smooth, juicy, and dank in the aftertaste, this beer slid right now and hid the alcohol well at the same time. Orange cream and stone fruit sweetness kicked in later with *tons* of rings of lacing left on nearly all of my pint glass as I worked my way through this. Has any beer I've ever had looked and tasted this impressive, in equal amounts?   Even with a bit of sediment floating in it, this beer was so beautiful on so many levels. I only felt a mild warming effect once I finished it off and it only added to the allure of the creamy, slick, and smooth mouthfeel of this brew. While not the best IPA that I've ever had, this may be the best of it's kind and the local equivalent of the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Worth it's lofty ratings on here, this may be the best the Tree House has to offer, which is saying a lot given their current portfolio. This was something that I can't ever get enough of!",0.6735299620203294,4.5,0.9746
Chocolate Rain,"Massive thanks to Morgan in socal for sharing this one with myself, mnphish, amyhran, icecoldphatty and others - 2012 vintage:  As you'd expect, it pours pretty much identically to the base beer... edges if copper clarity, a thin khaki head and loads of oily alcohol aftermath that coats the cup.  Surprisingly mellow bourbon quality - takes a back seat to a variety of figs and dates, milk chocolate, vanilla oak, fresh coffee beans, some sweet dessert notes... caramel or toffee. More chocolate goodness.  Wonderful. Sweet assertive bourbon layered with caramel, fudge cake, brown sugar, molasses, chocolate liqueur, just as big and bad as BT with chocolate addition that somehow draws everything together instead of pushing the diabetic envelope.   Incredible stuff. I remain in search of...",0.6384925046460839,4.75,0.9746
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Poured from a 16 oz can (canned 01/17/17) into a Veil House glass  Appear: nice beautiful golden haze a richer darker gold then some of the other street series brews. small amount off white foam.   Nose: citrus zest def smell the lime zest mentioned in the description. doughy sweetness from the malts peach and mango fruit notes as well.   Taste: follows the nose there is a very distinct woodsy piney bitter note that follows from the lime, grpaefruit juciy notes you get. I like it. Lime zest definitely the biggest note. Really digging the El Dorado.   Feel: silky smooth but a little thin.   OVer: My favorite of the 3 different street series I got in a recent trade. I like the lime zest and citrusy sweet notes that then bounce off a woodsy piney notes. Really nice",0.6650979706491141,4.25,0.9746
Beatification,"No surprise here, another beneficiary of RR's Batch 5 release. 8 oz. poured into a Fantôme tulip on June 15th, 2012.   A - Looks like a hazier Fou Foune. Good edge-clinging white, soapy head, great lacing.  S - I've never come across a brett aroma that I found particularly ""refreshing"", but this somehow is. Fresh cut haystacks, earthy, a bit herbaceous, touch of horse blanket, lemon vinegar. Great balance across the full spectrum of aromas here.  T - Sour. Bomb. This goes beyond Cantillon Classic Geuze. The level of biting tartness here is a bit stunning. Sharp citrus at mid-palate. Back end is cleaner grass and herbal.  M - The definition of finishing dry. Combined with the intense mouth watering, this is quite a tease to quench. Great carbonation, light body. Right on.  D - Hits the nail on the head while staying refined. Love it.",0.6855021624108,5.0,0.9746
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Pours pitch black with a nice tan colored head on top that sticks around for a while. The aroma is super malty, somewhat sweet, with some mild roast notes, lots of booze in the nose, leather, prunes, vanilla, dark chocolate.   The flavor is tremendously big and complex. Roasted dark malts, dark chocolate, vanilla, oak barrel, bourbon, dark stone fruits, caramel, black licorice, molasses, more booze, a little coffee. The flavor is BIG and INTENSE, even for a stout. And it's hot, I'm loving it!  This may have the biggest, fullest, heaviest mouthfeel of any beer I've had. Big, chewy, dense mouthfeel. A hint of something chalky in some sips. I've always been a fan of how full-bodied the regular Expedition Stout is, and it was nice to see their barrel aged version hasn't missed a beat in that department.",0.6620941503780728,4.75,0.9745
Peche 'n Brett,"Looks incredible - a hazy orange/pink. Orange julius-like Nose is awesome! so much peach, deep rich sugars and more peach! I'm drinking a peach right now - squeezed into my mouth- one of my most unique saisons I've ever had. Lots of funky-nectarine-peach goodness. So good! Mouthfeel is nice, slightly acidic and good carbonation. light dry finish - crisp Overall - you need to try this beer if you haven't already - you will not forget it!",0.6963108676911959,4.75,0.9745
Society & Solitude #4,Poured into a wine taster. The color is hazy straw to melon. There is a nice quarter inch head and lots of sticky lacing.  The aroma has a lot of sweet melony hops mixed with a touch of piney hop aroma.  The taste mixes sweet melony flavor with slight citrus notes and a touch of pine. The hop bitterness perfectly complements the malt sweetness. Yum.  This is medium to full bodied with nice subtle carbonation. This is super fantastic as expected from Hill Farmstead.,0.6858897276142348,4.0,0.9744
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"From 01/15/12 notes. Big, big thanks to ahalloin for sharing this one; thanks Tony. A beer I've never had purely due to the price tag. 750ml bottle into a tulip. Bottled on 04/26/11.  a - Pours a deep purple-red color with one inch of fluffy white head and moderate carbonation evident. Looks like a great kriek.  s - Smells of sour cherries, brett, funky, earthy notes, spices, yeast, and oak. Very nice, close to a 4.5.  t - Tastes of tart cherries, sour dark fruits, spices, brett, oak, earthy, musty, funky notes, and some Belgian yeast. Tarter than the nose and a big step up to me.  m - Medium body and moderate to high carbonation. Crisp, very nice for a kriek.  o - Overall this is another great kriek from Drie Fonteinen. Is it better than their normal kriek? Probably by a little bit, but when you consider how much more expensive this one is, I don't know if it is worthh the price, certainly not often. The difference between this and their normal kriek is not as wide a gap as it is between their Oude Gueuze and Oude Gueuze Vitnage, so personally I'd rather buy 2-3 bottles of the normal Kriek for the same amount of money. Definitely a good beer though.",0.6419853226324367,4.5,0.9744
Green,"Really beautiful pour of light orange. Opaque with a white one finger fluff. Disappears quickly but the lacing is phenomenal, leaving artwork on the glass. Citrus on the nose with some stone fruit. Taste follows the nose and this is where the brew really shines. Lots of well balanced flavours and a touch of bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is amongst the best I've encountered.   Definitely a great beer I'd love to have anytime.",0.6825906934809423,4.5,0.9744
Oude Geuze Vintage,"2006 vintage opened by drabmuh at a recent tasting.  Pours a hazy golden color with a nice white head and a fair amount of lacing on the way down. The nose smacked me right away with a really pungent horse blanket odor; loads of leather and must. A bit of hay and some slightly sour notes come through as well.   The taste brings on even more funk--it's like the sweat of wet leather that's been in a hay loft for the past four years. Just crazy funky. A bit of oak is present as well. Mouthfeel is nice and light to medium with good carbonation, really bringing the flavors through the full palate. Drinkability is pretty good, although as good as this tasted, I didn't immediately feel like I needed more after I'd finished my pour.",0.6553703394178706,4.0,0.9743
Sip Of Sunshine,"From a 16 oz can (packaged September 21, 2017) into a nonic glass.  A-The beer is barely hazy in the glass. Color is bright and orange-golden. A fat finger of off-white foam sits on top of the beer. Retention is OK, but the head is a little soapy and it fades after a minute or so. The foam leaves a spot of lacing on the glass.  S-The aroma demonstrates near-perfect balance of hop and pale malt notes. I sniff candied orange, a bit of red grapefruit, some mango, papaya, and tropical floral notes. There is a touch of leafy bitterness and a flavor that I sometimes pick up that I can only describe as fresh cedar.   T-The taste is similarly balanced. Some honey sweetness from the malts fades beneath citrusy, tropical hop flavor. The beer is mostly clean and bright but there is a little resinous note and a light medicinal flavor. Bitterness is moderate but it fits the beer well.  M-The body is medium to above-average in heft with a softer touch on the palate. Carbonation is fine and lighter in volume. Substantial but drinkable.  O-This is a pretty great beer. It is not a true haze bomb NE IPA, but it seems to straddle the line between what I would now call old-school style, e.g., Blind Pig, and new-school NE-styles. It is not the best IPA I've ever had, but I would definitely put this into the rotation.",0.6934896384198811,4.25,0.9743
Juicy,"A- Pours a hazy, orange/amber/rust color in the glass. A small to medium sized head forms and retains fairly well. Lacing is adequate. The overall pour is surprisingly dark.  S- The first impression of the scent in the nose is of light to moderate, lactic tartness. It almost smells like a sweettart at first impression. The middle of the smell is where the name of the beer is realized, with a good dose of juicy, and still tart, light graininess. After the smell there is a touch of lingering oak dryness and fruity, citrus juiciness.  T- This beer hits the tongue in a light burst of mild tartness right off the bat. Again, just like in the scent, I get just a hint of sweettart on the tongue, with a mildly sweet and lightly tart fruit flavor. In the middle of the drink, the flavor dries out a good bit and moves toward a slight hint of hops. That brief moment of mild hops bitterness balances the flavor before it reverts right back to light sour and fruit flavors. The end of the drink is fairly juicy, as the name would suggest, and the dry, oak flavor ramps up as the beer fades off of the palate.  M- On the palate, this one drinks just like the rest of the HF saisons, light and fluffy with a moderate to high level of carbonation. This beer is very easy to drink and drinks kind of like a juice.  Overall, this is a really solid brew. The flavor arc of tart, to juicy, to dry is a very complete and delicious cycle that also includes just a touch of hops. I was very surprised by the color of the pour and the new cap liner, but the actual substance of the beer was pretty good.",0.7003594093848023,4.5,0.9743
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"A- 750ml bottle into a small chalice with a mostly clear golden body and a thick frothy white cap. Good head retention and a fluffy ring remains at the edges. Thick sheets of lace form at each sip.  S- Hill Farmstead terroir with some added hops, such an amazing combonation. Lactic tartness from the bigs with notes of underripe stonefruit, passionfruit, apricot, Bretty barn funk, vinous oak and a very slight acetic hint. Bright and balanced between the hops and bugs.  T- The hops provide some more balance here as the Brett goes up and the lactic bacteria goes a bit down. Herbal, floral and fruity (stone/citrus) hops with lactic yogurt, fresh crushed wheat, vinous wet oak, vanilla oak degradation and underripe tart apricots. Horsey and a bit barney but still balanced wonderfully.  MF- Light body with a solid frothy texture and a high level of carbonation. A hint of slickness and a tart ending.  The base beer gets some vinous oaky feels. Wonderful balance between all of the elements and the barrel suits one of the best HF beers there is.",0.6919535537790666,4.75,0.9743
Enjoy By IPA,"First time trying an Enjoy By...have to say I'm impressed  Emptied the bomber into a chilled glass and was pleasantly surprised at how well the head held up (considering it being an IPA). Color is on point with what you'd expect from the style: Orange/amber. Smells pleasant, reminds me of a christmas tree. Great flavor with Pine, Citrus, and a slight Floral after bite.   Overall a fantasitc IPA - - - Has that fresh hoppy flavor you'd expect, yet isn't overly bitter, which gives each one of the flavors a chance to be noticed.",0.6688811407676084,4.25,0.9742
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2008 Vintage shared with my parents over breakfast on Christmas morning.  Appearance. Pours a deep ruby red, pretty clear with a big, frothy, nearly 3 finger of pale pink head.  Smell. Fresh rasberries, some sour barnyard funkiness.  Taste. Lovely sour funk, some really tart rasberry, lemon juice, and just a hint of vinegar.  Mouthfeel. Light+ body with big spritzy carbonation.  Overall. Just awesome. Perfect with the eggs benedict we had for breakfast. Refreshing, sour, just enough funk. Good call on choosing this one, if I do say so myself.",0.6479002140213336,4.5,0.9742
Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,"L - Pitch black, minimal foam, the only signs of carb are leaning against the edges of the glass, espresso brown in color. S - Smells of chocolate dipped raisins T - more chocolate than raisin. Charred oak mixes with a nice sweet vanilla. Still a lingering dark fruit end with a bigger expression of ris than expected, but I dig. F - it's thick, viscous and beautiful but the charred chocolate is making it seem a bit on the ashy-side. not overdone, but presenting itself more and more. O - I really enjoyed this, actually reminds me of the recent release of Assassin, the extra long aging (14 months!) in barrels really brought out some awesome complexities. I'm stoked to be able to revisit this thing down the road, scoop it up now!",0.6274371483735608,4.5,0.9741
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Fabulous, simply fabulous. Nice golden yellow pour with a perfect foamy head.

Juicy,"Poured from the bottle into stemmed wine glasses at the Hill Farmstead tasting room on 12/15/16. Pours a beautiful deep amber with great clarity and one finger of bubbly head. Aromas of white wine, oak and lots of yeast abound. Flavors are incredible. So much wine flavor, so much wood, great tartness. Deep, round flavor. Mouthfeel was excellent and kept drawing me back for another sip. Possibly the best wild ale I've ever had.",0.6679883317954736,4.75,0.9741

Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Pours black with one finger of khaki head that recedes to a thin collar with minimal lacing. Smell is mostly dark chocolate and bourbon with hints of vanilla and dark roasty coffee.  Taste is a well balanced blend of dark roasted malts, cocoa, hazelnut, espresso, and smooth bourbon. Very nice layering of flavors that hit all the right notes for the style.  Body is slick and silky smooth, but I find myself wishing it was just a bit more full and chewy. As great as the flavor is, I wish it hung on the palate a little longer.   All in all, another tremendous barrel aged offering from Jackie O's. While they never disappoint, this one is especially great.",0.6903939637848205,4.75,0.9741

Sure Bet,"22oz bomber poured into a snifter, no batch or bottled date unfortunately with the new PW bottling.   A- Pours a cloudy orange with a nice amount of frothy white colored head. Great looking beer.   S- Sweet citrus and tons of mango on the nose. The citrus is very pungent upon first popping the cap.   T- Initial taste is sweet mango and pineapple. The continued slightly sweet character might be the honey? Either way great tasting stuff.   M- Medium bodied, well carbonated, refreshing and easy drinking, bitter with a dry finish.   Fantastic DIPA from Pipeworks, just like much of their Unicorn lineup.",0.6569616904679962,4.75,0.9741

Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"dark pour with a tan head, leaves some lacing.   aromas of woody oak, vanilla, leather, subtle bourbon & chocolate, caramel. not overly pungent but quite nice.   taste follows nicely, molasses, chocolate, bourbon, caramel, honey, vanilla, roast, touch of booze on the fish. medium bodied with a nice creamy texture, gives hint of marshmellowy sweetness.   overall definitely a class BA stout, but its still hard to justify the over the top price.",0.6553158043009772,4.5,0.9739
Haze,"Ok, so it looks like pineapple juice with a good inch of soapy bubbles on top. That foam clings pretty stubbornly to the glass. It looks like a NEIPA should look (except they can says it is a DIPA). Canned on 10/02/2018 and consumed on 10/7/18.  It smells of orange, tangerines, maybe a little passionfruit. Grapefruit - seems to be like a Ruby Red, and grapefruit peel notes. A little earthy hop note at the end with a touch of apricot or peach.   The flavor is a nice mix of light tropical and heavy on the citrus fruits. Passion fruit sneaks in amongst the red grapefruit, orange, and tangerine dream thing going on. Slight apricot/peach. The grapefruit emerges with surprising strength. There is a substantial hoppy finish but more in the oily earthy arena than the bitter. Doesn't seems as intensely flavored as the aroma suggests. Slightly sweet, minimally bitter.  A bit of a tingle on the tongue, otherwise smooth but in my opinion it lacks proper DIPA (again, what the can claims it is) body...actually feels a tad bit watery.   While I think this is well made and tastes good, it's not hitting the mark for ""liking"" with me It's a nicely constructed NEIPA, but in my opinion it is one among the crowd - no better, no worse. It tastes good, it is easy drinking, but fails on the overall liking for me. That said, still worthwhile if it is readily available - stand in line for, maybe not so much.",0.6814064528313363,4.0,0.9739
Haze,"Serving: Can Canned: Mar-30-2016 (Consumed Apr-30) Thanks, KC!    Pours a cloudy pale gold with a big, billowing white foam cap that sticks around very well, big globs and rings of lacing. The aroma is a mix of juicy melon, orange, mango, pungent green hops and a biscuity malt backbone. The flavor is right on the smell's heels but a lot oilier and stankier as far as the hops are concerned; orange pith, grapefruit, soft mango flavors, melon and a final wave of dank, resinous hop cone oiliness. Medium body, active carbonation, fairly drinkable with a lingering sappy/sweaty finish.   This is a very good beer that I throughly enjoyed. It has a little something that sets it aside from other IPAs from TH as well as other beers that I have had. I could just describe it as sweaty. Both in taste and smell is is fruity, it is juicy, it is resinous, but there is a lingering undercurrent of a pungent, almost-sharp tang of funky dank hop stank. It is good, but it is also the one thing that keeps it from being more drinkable for me, especially since it is tied to the bitter oily finish. Fabulous beer.  I would definitely have it again.",0.6692819777118905,4.5,0.9739
Caffè Americano,"Poured into a 16 oz Snulip glass not sure when it was bottled and don’t care. Pours midnight black with a 2 plus finger head that falls at record speed and leaves no lace. 4  Smell is roasty coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, toffee, and roasted hazelnut. 4  Taste follows alcohol upfront, cocoa nibs, Expresso beans, vanilla, toffee, and some hazelnut in the bold finish. 4  Mouthfeel is a little bigger than average, moderate carbonation, a touch dry, and drinks easy enough, but the alcohol is around. 4  Overall this is a very nice stout, big and bold, and hits on all the usual expectations, with a little extra booze in the long lingering finish. Thanks Jzeilinger for this roast bold treat.",0.6271274275526079,4.0,0.9738
Green,"A nuclear blast of fresh cut pineapples, sweet tangerines, and the fabled tropical fruit cocktail of papaya, guava, and mango dominate the nose upon first whiff. Behind the initial bells-and-whistles lay a solid foundation of bitter grapefruit peels, and sure enough, the ""orange sherbet."" Tree House's signature yeast combination of white pepper, earthy spice, and grass surface toward the back as the brew warms up. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ As expected, the palate follows the nose admirably. Pungent tropical fruits, canned pineapples, and pink grapefruit juice is the initial sensation on the tongue, followed by a supporting cast of lemon rinds, sweet bread-like maltiness, and the Tree House yeasty spice. After the firework display of fruit-derived flavors subside, a tsunami of bitter resinous pine and grass wash over and linger on far after they've been extinguished from the palate. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Thick, creamy mouthfeel with a gorgeous full-ish body, verging on purée; feels slick and oily around the tongue and sticky on the lips, sip after sip. The brew sports a gentle, tongue-tickling carbonation, making it the perfect sipper -- like the two other Tree House beers I've tried, however, I can't imagine drinking more than one of these at a time or a different beer after drinking this without constantly being reminded of this one the entire time (hoppy burps ftw)",0.5762096103889751,4.75,0.9738
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Bottled April 9, 2004; Enjoyed at 3F with BA woosterbill and others. Cheers Will!  A - Pours a clear copper with two fingers of white head. Head has nice retention before fading to a cap.  S - Rich musty aroma that seems to be a 3F signature, with hints of citrus. Also a faint musty cheese aroma. Very nice.  T - Initially tart but not bracingly so. Very earthy, with building bitterness and tartness midway through with a considerable grapefruit bite. Very tasty.  M - Medium mouthfeel that is quite up front and finishes with substantial bitterness that lingers for awhile.  O - Very enjoyable. I'm loving the 3F musty funk. Good tart/bitter character with a nice earthiness as well.

Peche 'n Brett,"Bottle. Pours a cloudy, peachy color. Fluffy head. Very turbid. Aroma is full of fresh, under-ripe, slightly tart peaches. Earthy nose as well. Sweet and tart peaches. Flavor gives me a very authentic peach flavor that comes in both a sweet and sour manner. Sweet maltiness as well as a rustic funk from the Brett. The Brett character matches the peachy flavors very well. I am actually pleased to find that this one is not a super sour brew. Very peachy, Bretty, and authentic. The alcohol is hidden in with preposterous efficiency. I would like to experience more oak flavor.

Caffè Americano,"L: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a coal black color and a thick, opaque consistency. There was a quarter inch of creamy, tan-colored, somewhat long-lasting head. Average lacing.  S: An incredibly enticing aroma of coffee, roasted malt, dark chocolate, vanilla, and caramel.  T: Tasted of a good amount of roasted malt (present throughout), a tinge of caramel, a ton of espresso (the dominant ingredient), a hint of vanilla, and a lot of dark chocolate. An extremely rich, complex, and powerful flavor. The coffee's definitely the star here, but it's ably supported by the chocolate, et. al. Quite delicious.  F: An fair amount of carbonation with a silky smooth finish. Full-bodied.  O: An excellent beer. If you like coffee stouts, get some of this. Drinkable.",0.6823650377248338,4.5,0.9736
Vicinity,"Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip glass (two weeks old). Appearance is hazy yellow/brown with one finger thick head (decent retention). Smell is earthy hops, grapefruit pith, fermented sugar, wheat. It doesn't jump out at you, but the floral hops are pleasant.  Taste started out a little bitter but really grew on me. There is a good amount of grapefruit citrus to balance out the earthy hop flavor. Bitterness is moderate to low and fairly dry. Great medium body with a nice refreshing finish, very refreshing for 8% ABV. Overall, this is another great NE style IPA from Trillium. It doesn't have quite as much flavor or juiciness as some of their other IPAs, but Vicinity is refreshing with great balance and hop flavor.",0.7119803794714767,4.5,0.9735

The finish is salty and tart. This beer hit all the taste buds.  M- Crisp and light, coats the mouth evenly and has medium carbonation.  O- This beer is quality. I’m loving everything about it.

Guava and passionfruit all the way, with lemongrass and puckering citrus notes of kefir lime and the like. Very balanced malt backbone taking the sideline, with the rye adding a hefty dose of spiciness.   T: More juicy tropical hop notes with very restrained bitterness, and some white wine character upfront. Just enough malt to keep everything in check, with a bit of rye character to boot, but otherwise decently dry. Relatively short finish for an IPA, but very pleasant and with more bright fruit, some bready malt and a little bit of grassiness at the very end.  F: Medium body with pretty moderate carbonation. The carbonation is very tight-knit, giving the beer a fluffy mouthfeel.  Overall: Quality tropical IPA, and very drinkable. The rye is restrained enough not to take the spotlight away from the superb tropical hoppiness.",0.7072751372272017,4.5,0.9735
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Served in a standing stone snifter, stored at 40 degrees since release at T.G.  Black, slightly thick, completely dark  The nose if fantastic , awesome coffee, sweet, nice barrel.  This flavor just drops your jaw, aw man, wish the bottle was bigger, so - damn - good !!  Mouthfeel just as you would like.  If you have had it, you know exactly what I said, super solid beer.",0.6107085743159096,5.0,0.9735
Enjoy By IPA,"Over 3 days, I've had 3 of these already. I think that says a lot. Looks damn near perfect for a DIPA: bright, golden amber body, mostly transparent, with a foamy 2 finger head. Head dissipates down to a thin layer of foam and a little swirl of the glass stirs up a surprisingly thick layer of foam. Even the last couple ounces still produce more head than some beers I've tried when first poured! Smells of strong, bitter citrus fruits and a hint of pine. Taste is predominantly grapefruit, tangerine, orange, and lemon. I'm getting both the juices and the rind of each fruit flavor. There's some strong pine bitterness buried beneath all the citrus fruit, and a little bit of candy like sweetness way in the background. This is a great marriage of sweet and bitter, really embraces the west coast style of strong bitterness and is much more balanced than some of the east coast DIPAs I've had. Feel has a really nice drying effect from the hop oils, and feels full bodied and with medium carbonation. The one downside of this beer is it gets the tiniest bit harsh as it warms. I drank one relatively quick and the next day let it sit a little longer, and the last few swallows of the one left to sit out had a much more noticeable alcohol presence. Otherwise, this is an awesome DIPA and I'll be on the lookout for the next batch.",0.6746186991121909,4.5,0.9735
Sip Of Sunshine,"Pours a fiery shade of orange with just enough frosty haze to it to keep anything on the other side of the glass muddled from view. Head forms two fingers in height and stark white in color. Head retention is great, with a strong ring of white foam staying around the top of the beer for a long while. Lacing is scattered about randomly, but modestly. Aroma is dripping full of hops, with notes of citrus, pine, and resin. Additional notes of strawberries, and biscuit malts. Hop notes really open up in the flavor profile, with notes of citrus, orange zest, pine, and a little sticky resin in the back. Biscuit malts support the otherwise hop-strong flavor profile. Despite a large presence of hops, the beer remains grounded and modest, with an approachable aurora. Mouth feel is smooth, with just enough graininess to give this beer a wonderfully filling, and medium-thick consistency. Overall, it's a sublime IPA with plenty of wonderful qualities going for it. The hops are solid in the aroma, but really shine through in the flavor profile. It's hoppy, and yet smooth. Considering it hits at 8%, but drinks like it's 4%, this is an incredible IPA.   Served in a 12oz snifter.",0.6994428254051122,4.5,0.9735
Mastermind,"can dated 6/24/16...cool design! slightly hazed golden straw color, dense white head leaves great lacing. definitely looks different than your typical IIPA but nice nonetheless!   on the nose is an assertive tropical hop profile, nice pineapple and orange, peach fuzz, citrus zest, wet grass, and light herbal note. also has this super dank chemical like aroma going on, not sure if its a good thing but definitely interesting. unfortunately a bit of astringent alcohol coming through as it warms.   taste is orange, peach, pineapple, grapefruit ... subtle bitterness on the finish. feel is a little too light bodied for my taste, bordering on being thin. however it does coat nicely and the lightness makes it very drinkable.   overall im not sure what to think of this beer. its unique and flavorful, but its not really my style. I had a four pack of this and each can tasted significantly different to me. I tried one immediately after canning and was only getting this hugely herbaceous green note with grassyness and that same fake somewhat spicy medicinal dankness... almost no citric or fruity hops present. after a week or so, the expected tropical notes are present.  EDIT - have had this on a 2 additional cannings, and both times it was steller.",0.7021744135645339,4.5,0.9735
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"750ml bottle poured into a Cantillon balloon glass.  A: Vibrant, deep pinkish red. Gorgeous pinkish hue on the finger or so of head.  S: Fresh picked raspberries. That wonderful lambic acidity, funk, a bit of mustiness. Sour, funky and tannic.  T: Raspberries are prevalent. Like biting into a slightly overripe berry. I need to check my teeth for seeds. Great balance of acidity, fruit jammy-ness, oak tannin and just the right touch of funk. The freshest, most prevalent fruit character I've ever experienced in a sour beer.  M: Effervescent, smooth and superbly drinkable. Puckering and refreshing all at once.  O: Incredible. I tend to prefer fruited sours and this might be the best one I've ever had. The raspberry character is just incredible. I'm thankful I have another bottle.",0.6990308843818966,5.0,0.9734
Enjoy By IPA,"For Enjoy by 04.20.18 What I like an IIPA to look like! Clear gold with volumnous white head, great retention and lacing. Not as dank as I thought it would be given the date, but its there. Lots of mango and tangerine, though. More dank in the flavor, lots more mango, not as much citrus. Bit of malt sweetness, and a clean, bitter finish. A little stickier than I like, but not cloying. There's a reason some breweries are so successful even when they're not chasing trends.",0.6523264548676775,4.5,0.9734
Enjoy By IPA,"4.20.16 edition, enjoyed on 4.06.16  Pours a clear golden yellow, with moderate carbonation streaming up the glass. An off-white, billowy, two finger head caps it off, fizzling away leaving excellent lacing.  The nose is full of pine and floral hops with notes of orange, tangerine, grapefruit peel and lemon rind. There's a whiff of white pepper too.  When you drink this beer; resinous and unrelentingly bitter hops assault your tongue - scrubbing your taste buds - but ultimately paving the way for a crisp, light and well balanced, graham crackery, malt sweetness.   There's a touch of vanilla for a moment. Then juicy hops akin to the taste of nectarines, grapefruits and oranges reassert themselves and meld with the vanilla for a deliciously sweet, yet still bitter, orange creamsicle flavored ice cream float type of taste.  Mouthfeel is heavy and sticky. Finishes with a healthy alcoholic nip and a dry, delightful warmth to it. You can tell it's 9.4% ABV.  Overall it can be a little too bitter at times, and the mouthfeel is rather heavy and not what I would call thirst quenching, but it's a damn good IIPA.",0.6870627949437179,4.5,0.9734
Beatification,"Reviewed from notes from 6/10/14  Batch 05 A- Pours clear and golden with a half-finger of bright white tight foam. This recedes to a collar and leaves some lacing. Some nice alcohol legs are observed when swirled.  S- The aroma is very sour and there is a lot of Brett funk. Overripe apples, tart cherries, pineapple, and oak tannins. Some Granny Smith apple and lemony sourness. Very complex, refreshing, and inviting aroma!  T- Wow, this is warhead sour! Crazy amounts of cherry and lemon sourness. The oak tannins are the only thing restraining and mellowing the sourness. Very acidic and lactic. Refreshing, but bracingly sour!  M- The mouth feel is delicate, medium bodied, and lightly carbonated.  O- This is an excellent sour, though not for the uninitiated! Maybe lacking the complexity and subtleties needed to make it truly world class, but wonderful none-the-less!",0.6980938362186355,4.5,0.9733
Darkstar November,"Darkstar November was apparently a call-sign once used to hail down what some believe to be a working prototype of the rumored reconnaissance aircraft Aurora, whose existence has been and is still being denied by the United States Government.  Whereas conjecture over its existence leads to some dangerous hypotheticals such as ""why would the USG deny the existence of a reconnaissance aircraft"" and ""why have there been supposed sightings within American soil, in Southern California no less,"" the fact remains that both the existence of and the aircraft itself is enshrouded in mystery and we, as unprivileged civilians, will probably never come across the truth during our lifetime.  Never mind the spy aircraft that could or could not rain death from above, the only mystery surrounding the beer is perhaps ""how is this not more hyped up"" or ""how is this not Bottle Logic's flagship beer"" and finally, ""which testicle do I need to give up to procure a case of this?""  Throughout various stages of 2016 I've been lamenting what I thought was the death of the classic Bourbon Barrel-aged Stout. With BCBS having been an inadequate shadow of its former self and the trend for big stouts leaning more and more heavily toward adjunct ingredients, I was faced with an inconvenient truth as I was ushering in the new year: big, simple, no-nonsense BBA stouts were no longer sexy.  But against all odds, out of the ashes of dispair arose a bourbon-barrel aged Russian Imperial Stout sporting an incredible balance of flavors sweet, smoky, and bitter; a thick chewy texture with a huge huge body; a slick viscous velvety mouthfeel that lingers but doesn't overstay its welcome; a beer that finally brought sexy back to bourbon-barrel aged stouts. And its name was Darkstar November.  Admittedly I went a little overboard with the theatrical description, but Darkstar November is basically everything that used to get me excited about driving 40 minutes into Philadelphia to put together two four-packs of BCBS by paying 12 USD per bottle at three different Fooderies, with a touch of sweetness at the end from the molasses. The rye is mostly absent save for a slight ""spicy"" sensation toward the end of the tongue once the brew warms up.",0.6016191426744915,4.75,0.9733
Chocolate Rain,"2015 A total package stout.  Huge vanilla notes and chocolate whifs with dangerously smooth bourbon notes. This beer is complete, it needs nothing more, it was a little thin but it needed to be. Huge oak and vanilla, again and again. Good lacing from cold to warm. Pitch black monster from the chocolate depths!  I was so pleasantly surprised by this beer. Very thankful to finally conquer this brew!

Peche 'n Brett,"This poured out as a hazy orange color with a white sticky white head on top. Nice thin retention on top. The smell of the beer is sweet, fruity and has a subtle grainy backbone in there. Some really nice aromas on this one. The taste of the beer is mellow, there is a nice sweetness from the Peche and a very subtle tart Brett finish. Very smooth mouthfeel, very drinkable. Overall it's very good. Really enjoyable brew.",0.7021835596064375,4.5,0.9733
Peche 'n Brett,"Poured into a teku pint. Label says Best By: 03/2022.  A- Pours a hazy light amber color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a mostly full sheet of sheer surface foam. Resilient lacing leaves a thick, solid ring behind.  S- Moderate aromas of Brett funk and peach skin.  T- Brett in the forefront with some mild peach coming through mid-palate and finishing tart. Very refreshing and drinkable with the three different elements combining in a way that's very well-integrated. Also, the dryness of the Brett plays well with the sweetness of the peach. Definitely has a cleaner Brett character to it. Oh and I almost forgot to mention there's almost no trace to be found of the 10% ABV. So smooth.  M- A soft creaminess that's contrasted by the tartness. Medium carbonation and a lightish body.  O- Very well done. Glad I finally got a chance to try this one. Everything just fits together so seamlessly. Highly recommended.",0.6970664966720008,4.5,0.9733
Society & Solitude #4,"750ml growler, poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass.  The beer pours a super hazy, murky, unfiltered apricot color, hues of orange and honey with a thick, white, soapy head, easily 2 fingers high with very nice retention that yields a lovely network of sticky lace. The aroma is nice, dank yet juicy, citrusy and piney, grapefruit, hop resin, mangos, pineapples and some grassy weediness that brings out the floral qualities, very pungent, with light, doughy malt. The flavors line up very well, huge pine that brings out the earthy, grassy character, big juicy citrus and tropical fruit with some more rustic wildflower flavors, much stronger bitterness than the nose suggested with the signature hill farmstead malt character, chewy and very doughy without being too sweet, just supports the hops while also imparting a touch of bitterness. The mouthfeel is nice, very juicy while coating very well, lively but creamy and soft at times with a very dry finish that lingers nicely.  Verdict: A very nice Double IPA from Hill Farmstead, per usual. Excellent showcase of hops that are both juicy and dank but at times they fight for attention and the bitterness is a bit high and kind of puts a damper on the brightness and delicate nature of the flavors, more aggressive than I'm used to seeing from Hill Farmstead.",0.7137037415388034,4.25,0.9733
Todd The Axe Man,"Appearance: translucent bright peach color with no sediment.  Smell: orange citrus and peach. Very fruity and sweet. Just seems a little faded.  Flavor: taste of orange, peach and other notes tropical fruits. Its not as bitter as I expected, just fruity and sweet with some malt. This is far more balance then many IPA's I have tried. The after taste has a nice lingering orange flavor.  Mouthfeel: light to medium bodied, very smooth and clean.  Overall: a winner. I love notes of peach - I could almost swear peaches were added. Must be the Citra hops.",0.6809766282629146,4.25,0.9733

F- A bit chewy and can feel some chest heat. O - Overall this beer is fantastic. Very smooth and balanced. The high alcohol is masked very well. Be careful. It catches up with you really quickly. I split the bottle with a friend and didn't realize he only poured a glass. By the time the bottle was gone I was really starting to feel it.",0.6296223196102984,4.75,0.9733

Feel: medium to full Body a very slick oily mouthfeel. Overall: the smell on this beer is absolutely outstanding and makes you wanna dive right in and taste it. but saying that the taste is a bit unbalanced still this is pretty great but I think the booze comes through a little to much and pushes the other flavores aside.

Feel: medium to full body oily mouthfeel   Overall: almost 6 months old and the booziness has died down a lot. The beer is a lot more complex now and the hops are very present in the finish just like regular expedition stout.

Black Tuesday,"750ml bottle.  color: black, light brown head which quickly diminishes.  nose: caramel, wood, bourbon  taste: sweet caramel, brown sugar, wood (with some charring), vanilla, light dark fruit (prune), very complex  finish: starts sweet, turns acidic ( diminishes with oxidation ), ends with a mild bitterness and some remaining caramel.  overall: I poured this at 50F degrees which was clearly to cold. 55F or 60F is a better starting point. This beer also benefits from oxidation (about 15-30 minutes). Once at the right temperature and oxidized the flavors fully come through.  My impression: This is a ""best in class"" imperial stout.   Disclaimer: 5 ratings from me do not mean ""no room for improvement"". I simply do not believe in the concept. 5 rating from me means ""best in class"" at the time of the tasting.  updated: 12/31/14",0.6687488237759331,5.0,0.9732

Soapy white head that stands 1 finger tall with good retention and sticky lacing.Hazy orange colored body with low clarity,and distorted light showing through the glass.High amounts of sediment floating around in the glass,and heavy fast moving carbonation.  On the nose I get heavy amounts of citrus and tropical fruit notes,mango,pineapple,tangerine,and oranges.I also get a good balance of floral and piney hops blended with sweet,breaded,and earthy malts.Trace elements of spice in there as well.Very complex aroma on this one.  The palate follows the nose with piney bitter,and floral hops up front,balanced by sweet and earthy malts.On the back end I get citrus and tropical fruit hops also balanced by sweet and earthy malts.Grapefruit,tangerine,orange,and pineapple in the middle and on the back end,and sweet malts balancing the brew from start to finish.  The mouth feel is medium heavy with a sticky and chalky texture,and a dry finish.Heavy amounts of oxidation popping on the tongue.  To be honest this is probably the best IPA I have ever had.Now keep in mind I have only had what is available in Florida,so I still haven't delved into the east coast IPA's that I hear everyone in Massachusetts raving about,but I am moving to Massachusetts in five weeks so those are coming.This is a very well crafted,and amazingly well balanced IPA.I'm probably going to pick up a couple of 4 packs after this.I would HIGHLY recommend this one not just to the hop heads but to anyone who loves craft beers.And I will definitely be drinking it again.Perfect combination of all of the different hop characteristics.Well done Surly,well done!!!",0.7070125431307606,4.75,0.9732
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"(This was tasted on tap at the DL release day 2006. It was served in a plastic cup and I transferred it to a pint glass).  The head was small and redish tan with some swirls on the top. The appearance of the beer was densely black.   The smell was of coffee, oak, bourbon, chocolate, rasins and vanilla. Faint hint of hops.  The taste was heavenly! I savored each sip. Rich chocolate, bourbon, rasins and coffee with a slight bitterness at the back end.  The mouthfeel was thick and not too carbonated. This coated the tongue nicely.  Drinkability was wonderful. The aging did this 2005 vintage DL well. The flavors have all blended nicely and the bourbon gives you a real kick in the palate.   I would have to say that this is the best barrel aged beer I have ever had. I was privilaged to try this one. Way to go Nick and all the folks at Three Floyds!!",0.6358358101910655,5.0,0.9732

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"12oz bottle from Sprayberry Bottle Shop (Marietta, GA). 5.99. Bottled 10/16/18. Served in a Bell’s snifter. Enjoyed 11/23/18.   Pours oil black with a generous cap of dense tan foam. Retention is minimal, amounting to a razor thin rail, a small surface patch and a couple tiny web strands of lace.   Beckoning aromas of bourbon, vanilla-like wet oak, espresso, dark fruit, cocoa and tons of roasty character.   Smooth sweet bourbon meets bitter, roasty malt and blend beautifully in the flavor. The familiar, assertive Expedition is on full display but tempered by its recent sentence in barrels. Bourbon-soaked oak, dark chocolate, burnt caramel, espresso shot, dark fruit, heavily kilned malt, faint vanilla and a good bit of booze. Delicious.   Creamy, full feel with fairy light carbonation. Aftertaste of bittersweet, roast and burnt bourbon chocolate balls.   Bell’s is doing things right once again. The barrel treatment does wonders for the already-outstanding Expedition. A great barrel aged Russian imperial stout that I believe I prefer over Black Note.",0.6682192689747962,4.75,0.9731
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,Stunning. No 12oz beer is worth what this costs to obtain but this is as close as it gets. Nose is superb. Smells of pure Maple. The empty bottle still smelled days later.

Schaerbeekse Kriek,"750 bottle into teku. Bottled 4/28/2010.  A: Pours a deep cranberry juice red with a minimal soft white head that faded into a lasting collar. S: Musty attic, damp basement, and old oak barrel are prominent. The cherry adds a mellow sugary sweetness with tannic notes of cherry pits and skins. Mild cheesiness, faint tartness. T: Sweeter, juicier, and fruitier than I expected from the nose. Cherries are fruit juice-like, but not cloying. The musty wood and light wheat base follow, with flavors of honey and earth in the finish. The tartness is very mild with just a kiss of bright acid. Flavors remind me of wildflower honey. Slight grape. Wheat and interesting yeast profile come through more as the beer reaches room temp. M: Medium-light body, smooth and slick mouthfeel with a slight amount of gritty tannins. Drying finish, low acidity, low carbonation. O: Four and a half years old has done this well. Not as tart or funky as I expected, but very woody with an interesting floral honey sweetness. Very delicious.",0.6806742818656435,4.25,0.973
Swish,"Service:Can No date   A: Thick-looking, cloudy, white-gold with puffy white scum head that settles to a tight little film. Standard NE IPA. (4)  S: Masticated guava, mango, pineapple, weed and pungent earthiness back it all up. Clean, stoned fruit salad layers. (4.5)  T: A wavering flavor between tropical pulp and fermented sap, it comes on pretty sweet and almost immediately darkens up and gets resinous and bitter, both components are still there though with some crackery malt in the background. (4.5)  M: Smooth, creamy and soft with a sharp boozy prickle interlaced with the sappiness, gets to be pretty heavy after a while. (4.5)  O: Wowee! Really nice beer.  Huge and drinkable with lots of fruit in the nose and the forest on the tongue. It looks par for the course for these types of beer. Nose is similar too. Really strong guava and mango come through, pretty clean aroma. The flavor is a bitter-leaning balance between the aroma and eating a pinecone rolled in kief. It is a little boozy, but it fits nicely with everything. Especially if we are assuming that it is a faithful re-creation of the “old, dirty, shitty-tasting, homemade fucking liquor” from TPB ; )  Really good. Would jump at the chance to have it again.

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Drank from a 12.7 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA Served in a snifter  Review #1675  Dark brown and medium bodied in appearance. Both lighter in color and thinner in viscosity than I anticipated. A larger bubbled, near finger-tall mass of tan colored froth topped the liquid. The head quickly transformed into a thick, clingy collar. Odd-shaped patches and tiny droplets of lacing coated the glass and stuck around until almost the drink’s end.  The aroma was really interesting. Rich and malty with big powdered cocoa notes. Some milk chocolate perhaps as well. Loads of cinnamon too. Slightly sweet. Mexican hot chocolate definitely came to mind. Hint of bourbon and vanilla. Almond notes appeared as the beer warmed.  The adjuncts definitely played a smaller role in the flavor profile. Malty and robust on the front end. Fairly roasty. Cinnamon came through in the center but not to the extent it did in the nose. Bit of powdered cocoa. The beer finished with big boozy notes, more roast and a spiciness that crescendoed after the swallow.  Terrific fluffy, frothy mouthfeel. Creamy and smooth on the palate. Medium bodied for the style. The liquid contained a supple, tongue blanketing effervescence.  Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro is a tasty and complex beer that really grew on me as it warmed. Unlike many barrel-aged Mexican chocolate-inspired imperial stouts, this one demonstrated a nice balance amongst its ingredients (especially the pepper spice notes) and was surprisingly drinkable. For what this beer lacked in body and intensity, it made up for in sheer enjoyability.",0.6918585548748106,4.5,0.9729
Black Tuesday,"2014 version, so already a bit of age.   L- Black, thin off-white head that barely lingers.   S- Holy crap, that's boozy. Keep away from open flames. Behind that's there's a nice bourbon and milk chocolate aroma, The booze faded a bit once it warmed up.  T- Much like the smell, it's very strong. Once you get past that, it's a nice caramel/chocolate/bourbon. Smoother and more drinkable once it warmed up.   F- Thick, sticky syrup. Very rich.   O- There's some good stuff here, but the booze is a bit overpowering. I would like this more if it were in the 12-15% range. It was a lot better once it warmed up, a chocolatey and sweet after-dinner beer.",0.6426174161698881,4.25,0.9729
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),Draft. Finally found my notes for DLD and getting these in to review! Draft. Poured a pitch black color with minimal head (I'm sure the plastic cup helped with that). Smells like DL but with huge hints of the oak barrels. Subtle sweetness. Slight smokiness. Adding the DL to the Oak barrels was a great move that only added additional complexity to this beer. Would be great to see it bottled instead of having to drink it from a plastic cup at DLD.,0.6094523114033644,4.5,0.9727
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Packaged 10/16/2018 and served in a Spiegelau tulip. Pours an inky black with an 1/8th inch, loose, mocha-colored head that quickly disperses towards the shoulders into a frothy band. A spiral galaxy slick adorns the center of the bowl. Nose reveals huge barrel notes, followed by rich chocolate, dark fruits and ethanol - entirely decadent. Taste follows nose - wow! Just wow! There's an additional char that comes to at the finish and keeps the flavor profile from being cloying. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a consistent, even carbonation and an oily texture. Overall, an amazing beer and a long time want. Delighted and not disappointed with this one.",0.6779257398338122,4.5,0.9727
Madagascar,"The comparison to Vanilla Rye is inevitable but I think a bit misguided. We're talking about a 9.3% milk stout versus an almost 14% imperial stout. Cue up the comments of ""Madagascar is too thin"" ... absurd considering the impressively creamy, almost marshmallowy body, close to perfect for the style. And, again, comments ""needs more bourbon"" ... when the bourbon marries perfectly with the beer and serves to highlight the incredible vanilla flavor rather than overwhelming it, which would turn this into a souped up version of vanilla extract.   If there is one ""critique"" I have it's that the base beer does get a touch lost under the vanilla. But, then, perhaps it's just married so closely that the two become indistinguishable. The purest expression of real vanilla I've come across in a beer. I'd love to see them amp up the base a bit to an imperial version and give it the same treatment.

Aaron,"2016 vintage. Poured from a 16oz bottle into a Hill Farmstead stemmed goblet. Acquired at the source a few weeks ago. Popped for my 28th birthday.   Pours a muddy brown body with a two finger off-white head that reduces at a moderate rate to leave a ring of retention and some spotty lacing.   Aromas are sweet and dessert like with lots of vanilla, bourbon-caramel, toffee, a nice sweet bakery-like character on the nose.  The tongue follows the nose with huge, flavor packed notes of sweet, sticky dark caramel, dark fruits, rich bourbon, vanilla cookies, followed by a hot boozyness that isn't off-putting at all, finishing roasty with a tad bit of coffee on the finish. Mouthfeel is extravagant, rich and thick with low carbonation. Definitely a sipper.   One of the best Barleywines I've ever tasted.. rich, thick, and I'm not sure of the ABV but I feel pretty warm and toasty after this bottle. This would be perfect to sip next to a fire.",0.6626959920269301,4.75,0.9727
Society & Solitude #4,"Shaun's S&S #4 is the best beer I've ever had from HF. Poured from a fat growler into a plastic cup. (We were camping right after getting it in Greensboro). Beautiful deep yellow/amber color, light frothy head. Delicious aromas of citrus fruit and resiny hops. Couldnt wait to taste this. First sip blown away. Hoppy, citrusy and floral with the right amount of bitterness. A touch alcohol forward as well which I enjoy in a double IPA. As another reviewer said, such a clean finish, so impressive. This is a flat out world class beer. I like it much more than S&S #5.",0.6510673125069429,4.75,0.9726
Swish,"picked it up recently. BB does awesome releases (free gourmet coffee and donuts), lines moves super fast.  Looks hazy, like their trademark style of unfiltered goodness. orangish color. aromas of layers of tropical fruit, sweetness and dank smell. taste is so phenomenally full of hops and more hops with all the wonderful citrus and tropical fruit balanced with hop bitterness. Love it!",0.6625612955573911,5.0,0.9726
Chocolate Rain,"This is hands down my favorite Breuery beer so far (have not had Tuesday yet). It is not nearly as hot as some of the other high abv offerings. In fact, I would say at 18.4 % it drinks more like 11-12.  Tons of sweet chocolate, vanilla, oak, and brown sugar. Nice, smooth bourbon compliment. It is sweet without being too rich or cloying. Like a bourbon infused chocolate mouse or cream pie. The body is outstanding. This is truly a world class beer and a must experience one.",0.6397686612846002,4.75,0.9725
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Served on tap at Dark Lord Day 2010...about a 6 ounce pour, enough to give me a good idea about this beer...  Pours just like regular Dark Lord...thick, black, oily and viscous, little bit of dark brown head...  Smells of chocolate, sweet roasted malts, brown sugar, molasses, a bit of vanilla and some bourbon and wood aromas as well...  Tastes just as it smells, chocolate and molasses, some vanilla and bourbon and a tiny bit of drying oak, not much though. Really enjoyed the complexity of this beer and enjoyed the fresh Dark Lord on tap...  Thick and creamy, chewy and coating...full bodied with good carb...  Another winning variation of Dark Lord, slightly prefer the vanilla bean though...",0.6320819065548343,4.5,0.9725
Swish,"Giving this a 4.5 as an average, as I've had this three times now and the first two times it was amazing. But this 12/22 batch of Swish is not the same as usual. It's got different flavor than previous batches imo. Slight let down after a sub-zero, pre dawn line! :) Still love Bissell Beers! The Substance is better and better every time.",0.5816269160253906,4.5,0.9725
Enjoy By IPA,First impression: Wow! Tasted from bottle. Pours a clear gold with white head. Huge aroma of citrus floral and pine. Excellent nose. Taste is similar to the nose with robust citrus and floral bitterness mixed with a mild caramel sweetness. It's all about the bitterness here though. Medium bodied with some nice stickiness to the palate. One of the best IPAs I've had. Well done guys!,0.6962632373018921,4.5,0.9725
Oude Geuze Vintage,"From 09/25/10 notes. Had at a small tasting thanks to drabmuh; thanks Matt! 2006 Vintage.  a - Pours a somewhat transparent golden color with one inch of white head and low carbonation.  s - Smells of sour fruit, spice, tart lemon, grapes, and some oak. Definitely a lot of funk in the smell; I imagine what some people call that wet horse blanket smell.  t - Tastes of sour, sour fruit, mainly lemon and citrus. Also some spice, tart apples, and a woody/oak to it. Again, lots of funk.  m - Light to medium body and low carbonation.  d - A very nice, very funky gueuze. Lots of tart fruit and funk in the smell and taste; if you like that you'll probably love this one. It seemed like a pretty hardcore sour and not my favorite, but definitely one I enjoyed a lot. Would definitely try again. ___  Edit on 01/24/12: I've had vintages of '06, '07, and '08 at this point, and multiple bottles of some, and this is one of my favorite sours easily available out there. Very much worth seeking out.",0.638965355766057,5.0,0.9725
Chocolate Rain,"Poured into a snifter, about 6-7 oz. 2011 vintage (Batch 2).  3.0 A: Deep brown/black color. Head fell just about as soon as it was made.  4.0 S: Surprisingly, the booze is fairly well hidden, in the the nose at least. Big roastiness, lots of sweetness, but reasonable. Chocolate, vanilla, molasses, and leathery bourbon. Coffee underneath. It's intense, but it doesn't have much of the subtlety or complexity that I like to discover in the style.  2.5 T: Big roast, lots of chocolate, caramel, and molasses. Vanilla with oak underneath. Big leathery bourbon. Uncontrolled sweetness and booze, but not quite as bad as BT '11 was.  3.0 M: Heavy body. Good moderate carbonation. Too thick and chewy though otherwise okay.  2.5 D: This is undoubtably tough to drink and no one in my 'burgh tasting group cared for it.",0.6468199436183946,2.5,0.9725
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Bottle brought to the recent tasting courtesy of exitmusic00. Thanks homie.   A- Pours a standard DL pitch black with a thin mocha head that leaves minimal lacing.  S- Similar to last year's Bourbon DL with loads of earthy bourbon upfront, oak, dark chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, dark fruit and wood with hints of vanilla and molasses   T- Again bourbon is prominent, but is smooth and complex with notes of dark fruits including raisins, fig, black cherry as well as roasted malt, vanilla, oak, molasses and some roasted malt.   M- Low to medium carbonation. A little hot, but the abv is still hidden fairly well.  O- A superb bourbon aged RIS that I consider to be a tad better than last year's DL PVW treatment. The bourbon is so smooth and well integrated into the base beer. It's incredible what barrels do to DL. My favorite treatment of the '12 varieties .",0.6631682842424459,4.5,0.9724
Mastermind,"Pretty much right off the bat you can smell that this beer is special. It has a really unique hoppy aroma that is very distinct and interesting. The flavor is outstanding. This is one of those beers that you sit and rock your head back-and-forth in disbelief. It really is that good.   The only reason I don't give it a complete five star review is that in the past I've judged beers on the clarity/turbidity a little harshly. Although I don't really care a whole lot anymore, it wouldn't be fair to judge too differently. This beer is a little cloudy but I honestly like that. I really like the spear and hope that I can find it again soon. I need more friends to travel to Vermont I guess.",0.5899834122640993,4.75,0.9724
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Mad props to BeirRunner who brought this and four other stellar Jackie-O's offerings today. BIG coffee flavor with a nice, but lesser prominent bourbon barrel accompaniment. Superb quality coffee is what is making this one a huge winner with me. Super smooth.

Beatification,"375 ml bottle, batch 5 graciously sent to me by smarcoly. Thank you for the hook-up as always! Served into a Lost Abbey tumbler.  A: Semi-hazy golden orange colored body with a modest finger worth of white head. Not much lacing and only a minor ring of bubbles lined the edges of the glass. For the style, this isn't unexpected at all.  S: Lemon, acidic funk, tart citrus notes, orange, white grapes. The barrel character surprisingly comes through towards the end with plenty of soft oak and sweet vanilla. An absolutely delightful smelling beer.  T: More acidic lemon, orange and peach up front which transitions into a quick oak character. The tartness washes quickly through the palate bringing in some dry white grape flavors and ending with touches of floral spice.  M: Highly carbonated, prickly and spritzy on the palate though never feeling thin at all. Really what you'd want from a Wild Ale. No dryness or linger of anything off-putting. Just really well done in this aspect.  Easily my favorite of all the Russian River sours I've sampled to date. This one has a very bright citrusy profile I love. Hands down one sour I'd drink on a regular basis if I could.",0.6848549020485216,5.0,0.9724

Double Orange Starfish,"Traded for this a while ago, but the date on the bottom of the can was not completely legible so I have no idea how old this was when I cracked it open on this hot night! Saw the lofty rating for this and even though this can wasn't fresh, this was as big and enjoyable a juice bomb that I've had in quite some time, and easily one of the best New England IPA's that I've ever been able to review here at the house!  Good pour to this as the liquid looked like pure orange juice, with just a bit of a darker hue to it. Enough head topped this off but that didn't translate to the lacing as the bubbles were only seen near the top of my pint glass once I started to work my way through this. Loads of orange, tangerine, vanilla cream, garlic, scallions, and tropical fruits in the nose as the juiciness really burst through in the taste. Slick, smooth, and sweet, there was an underlying hint of spice that livened things up and complemented the initial taste that hit my palate and somehow, it worked! Candied citrus and an underlying dankness rounded things out as this beer didn't stay in my pint glass for very long!  The amount of alcohol in this was spot-on as it was present, but hardly felt, with all of the flavors complementing each other quite nicely to go along with the moderate carbonation. A juice bomb if there ever was one, this was more than one-dimensional and left me wanting more. In the end, isn't that what any good beer should have as it's parting shot?",0.6669116847745695,4.5,0.9723
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"If there's any beer that deserves the rating of a 5, it's this one. Generously shared by Clark at the Chainsmoker release on 9/16, 2014 Gold Wax version.   Decadent chocolate, with a strong maple mouthfeel and coffee flavor with the perfect hint of bourbon. Every part of it comes together perfectly to make a truly amazing beer.",0.631167644431224,5.0,0.9723
Beatification,"750 mL Batch 3.  Pours dark, little cloudy, golden tangerine color with not much head nor lacing.  Smells a little lactic with sourness. Some funk, not much. Tart with lemon, peach, and grapefruit.  Tastes really sour, similar to the nose. Lemon, grapefruit, some sour cherries. Not much funk like a Cantillon, but a really clean, crisp, well done sour beer. As it warms it makes my cheeks pucker more. Good carbonation, with some oak tannins to dry my mouth.  Great sour beer, well done RR.",0.6418132702232149,4.5,0.9723
Flora,"Sparkling cider-like gold with a fizzy off-white foam quickly dying to a bubbling but clear surface.  Aroma is green apple, pear and herbal white wine oak--I can see why adding additional pear works so well with this. Faint notes of skunky cannabis blossoms as it warms, only adding a welcome touch of complexity.  Like an effervescent champagne, taste is white grape and tart apples with accents of peppery vinegar, without the acidity.  The tingly semi-dry finish is lemony, as a faint straw funk arises at warmer temps.  Bottled November 2016",0.6432367404731238,4.25,0.9723
Society & Solitude #4,"Fuck. This beer in my glass in Portland. HOW? Flip top 750 opens with a hiss, nice frothy head, beautiful color, the perfect, I mean perfect haze, the orange, the amber, the lemon rind. Aroma is amazing citrus, some pine, some melon some stone fruit. The flavor, soft up front, ripe citrus, grapefruit, melon. Crisp and clean mouthfeel with just that bit of pucker holding on to remind you that this is incredible. One of the best things I have ever tasted.",0.684806814597701,5.0,0.9723
Coolship Red,"Well I just popped a beauty from @walderek Allagash Coolship red (aged in oak with raspberries. Bottle date Oct. 18, 2012  Pours a beautiful amber with hints of pink toward the edge of the glass when held up to the light. Frothy finger of loose foam quickly recedes and disappears within a minute. Smells of a dry white wine, like a chablis or maybe more in the direction of a Spanish Cidra. Taste begins litely sour with the chablis qualities then builds to a stronger raspberry tart meets sour. Finishes more raspberry tart.   Sat on this one for a while. I like it pretty well. Wish I had tried it fresh as well to compare.",0.622762949607042,4.0,0.9723
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Even though there is not a lot of head or lacing, when you take a drink, it feels light and fluffy as if there was foam in it (which I don't like). The smell is not too strong but enticing, bringing to mind fresh spring air. The flavor fulfills its promise. The beginning is bright and the aftertaste is a pleasant sweetness. It's also cool to taste from the world's oldest brewery.",0.6658977693315586,3.75,0.9723

Viscous, strong, sugary, fresh bourbon, aged bourbon, and bourbony hints of bourbon. mouthfeel still has active carbonation.   Vintage 2012.

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"2018 vintage - Pours black with a fairly dense creamy tan foam head. The smell of this beer from the bottle was an amazing sensory experience. It is reminiscent of something like a dark chocolate covered toasted brown bread with a dash of cinnamon on top. In the glass aromas of creamy vanilla and sweet cinnamon hit up front with a habanero pepper spice laying beneath, with rich dark chocolate, toasty brown bread, walnuts, oak barrel, some bourbon, caramel, toffee, candied dark fruits, and some earthy pine. The flavor is a blast of equal proportions. Rich dark chocolate, cinnamon, habanero pepper spice, creamy vanilla, toasted brown bread, walnuts, oak, bourbon, caramel, toffee, candied dark fruits, and some earthy piney hops to balance. Feels lighter medium bodied, creamy smooth with moderate carbonation. Overall a real great bourbon barrel aged imperial stout.",0.6457677260880395,4.75,0.9723
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Pour is jet black, thick tan head. Aromas are led by the barrel, but the dark chocolate aromas are present, as is the honey.  The taste has the dark chocolate evolving to a rich cocoa flavor, which may be the combination of the dark chocolate flavors and the honey. Whatever it is, I absolutely LOVE it. There's also a boozy burn present, but it's well onto the back of the palate, and isn't overwhelming in any way.  I wish I'd purchased three bombers of this, because it is exceptionally well executed.",0.6624681538406658,4.5,0.9722
Haze,"A - nice murky golden orange amber color with a thick white head that sticks S - big peach, pineapple, mango, papaya, passion fruit, very ""soft"" smelling T - peach, papaya, mango, passion fruit, again very soft tasting. Little bit of hop resin/grapefruit. Has a creamy flavor it their too. It's like the whole milk of beer. M - light to medium mouthfeel. Very soft feeling. Alcohol completely covered. Feels more like 4-5% alcohol if that. Aftertaste is is peach, passion fruit, papaya.  O - amazing. It definitely brings me back to when I first tried sap and Julius. It showcases that ""Tree House flavor that really doesn't exist anyplace else.",0.648211973915795,5.0,0.9722
Haze,"Pours a matte light yellow-orange color. Looks like OJ. Completely opaque. Thick frothy white head dissipates steadily leaving a residual thin layer of foam and lots of sticky white lacing behind. For the NE style IPA this is an excellent appearance.   Smell is pungent and permeating - strong notes of orange, tangerine, peach, mango and passionfruit all are noted.   Taste follows the nose with lots of strong citrus flavors - orange, tangerine, and grapefruit - along with some peach and mango initially. Quickly transitions to some English biscuit like malt, some grassy hop notes, and dry hopped flavors. Almost no bitterness although you certainly get lots of hops flavors.   Feel is medium to full bodied, thick, yet extremely drinkable. Moderate carbonation is perfect for the heft of this beer. Smooth dry finish.   Overall this is a fantastic NE style IPA from Tree House. Certainly lives up to the expectations.",0.6997617791567738,4.5,0.9722
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2003 vintage  I haven't had too many cantillons, but they impressed me again with this one. Gonna try to get my hands on as many as possible.  A: looked like a burnt orange color, or a sunset  S: pure garbage, literally, smells like garbage juice that Illuminates? the room. awesome, can't wait to drink it.  T: sour as can be, you feel it in the back of your mouth. ""stings the nostrils"" the aftertaste is quite exceptional.  M: medium and mild carbonation  D: Right before my son Thomas tasted it, he said, ""I have a feeling i'm gonna really like this one."" He took a sip and the face he made was priceless, just pure sourness. He said it was awful, but then said ""wow, that was bad but also very good. I think I'll take another sip."" perfect description.",0.5862369724776526,4.25,0.9721
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"Acquired from Swettenham_Shire so a big “Thank You” goes out to him. Poured from a 12.7oz bottle into a tulip glass.  A: The beer is a deep black color, with a very thin beige head that fades quickly and leaves a very thin lace on the glass.  S: The aroma contains strong bourbon and maple along with roasted malts, some coffee and chocolate.  T: The taste likewise starts out very sweet with strong flavors of bourbon and maple. Then a hearty roasted malt character breadiness comes in. There are some mild background flavors of chocolate, coffee and licorice. The hops presence is extremely mild as you would expect with this type of beer and there’s a very good balance despite the sweetness and strength of the maple and bourbon. The after-taste is sweet.  M: Crisp, very smooth and a bit viscous, medium-to heavy body, light-to-medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.  O: Tasty, goes down dangerously easy, slightly filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a very good beer to sip on for a long time.",0.6964391353574144,4.25,0.9721
Coconut B-Bomb,"The BBomb has and will surely continue to be 0n my top 5 stout or strong ale list. Most of those are from Fremont's barrel aging program. I prefer the Regular to the Coffee Cinnamon, but when I had this at a bottle share I had to start saying top 6 as it is equally amazing if not a tad better. Coconut is the perfect complement to this brew. Luscious is the perfect adjective.",0.6426712607113231,4.75,0.9721
Second Fiddle,"Modest finger deep head, just off-white, even surface, few dimples, retention is good for what’s there initially, lacing starts out as wide sheets eventually breaking into thinner streaks. Soft gauziness to the liquid but nowhere near filmy or cloudy, bright golden color, noticeably dispersed tiny bubbles, like gentle snowflakes just, err, going up. Honeyed nose, tangerine to pink grapefruit and lime, citrus a major component, fresh unbaked pie crust, pine sap, coal tar, starts heading in a dank direction and suddenly stops, this allows the pineapple, apricot, green melon scents to spread some, not fully tropical in nature. Full-bodied, dry mouth entry, almost scrubbing in feel, the carbonation active with more prickle than creaminess. The breadiness more toasty and here the tarriness sinks in deeper. White pepper and a light salinity take the sappy goodness out of the pine notes. Somehow the pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus gets pushed back to past the mid-palate, the carbonation churns it away. Papaya, pineapple, green apple to nectarine fruit, here it’s just the dryness which has it come off as not that tropical. Overall, there’s a lot going on and it never loses your attention. That said, could wish for more smooth integration.",0.6767189611568736,4.0,0.9721
Black Tuesday,"2016 bottle  A: Pours black with half a finger of sudsy khaki head that quickly fades into a thin ring with no lacing.  S: Sweet roasted malts, chocolate, candy sugar, vanilla, molasses, oak, dark fruits (raisins, dates, prunes), and booze.  T: Super sweet chocolate, caramel, and molasses up front with oak and dark fruits and a hugely boozy finish.  M: Thick body with low carbonation, this beer is has a sticky sweet and syrupy feel.  O: A pretty decent beer overall, but I think it would benefit from extensive aging. Super sweet and extremely boozy, it's more like a fortified desert wine or Port.",0.6490592628852094,4.0,0.9721
Madagascar,"Pours a very dark chestnut brown with two-and-a-half fingers of mocha-colored head. Sheets of lacing.  Delicious aroma of cocoa, brownie batter, vanilla, leather, toffee and bourbon in the nose. Really great.  Lighter tasting than the nose suggests. Chocolate, vanilla and milk are the most prominent, with a little nuttiness, leather, tobacco and earthy hops behind to balance out any sweetness. Slight alcohol behind.  Appropriate feel for a the style, but, IMO, it's thin against all these flavors. Also a bit sticky, with modest carbonation.  A little more heft in the body and barrel heat would make it better, to my taste, but this still has a really nice balance of flavors -- especially in the aroma. As a milk stout, it's excellent.",0.67886170343949,4.0,0.972
Oude Geuze Vintage,"2002 vintage generously shared by cpferris. Thanks Chad.  A: Pours a cloudy golden iced-tea color with a quarter inch of bubbly off-white head that faded into a thin film. S: Light tartness and a decent amount of earthy funk fill my nostrils, but the nose on this one isn’t super potent. I get a bit of sweat as well. T: The delicate flavors follows the nose. I’m getting a lot more citrus than I expected though. The finish is full of lemon and earthy funk, and the aftertaste has some citrus rind tartness and a touch of biting acid. Not super complex. M: Bubbly carbonation that is very active on my palate. Mouthfeel is lightly acidic and very dry.  O: A very drinkable gueuze if there ever was one, I just wish it was a little more potent.",0.7041187826708144,4.0,0.972
Black Tuesday,This is an outstanding BB beer that lived up to the hype. Black as motor oil this monster comes in at 19.2%. The well hidden ABV sneaks up on you and before you realize it the bottle you shared with a few friends is empty and your stumbling about. I cant say enough about this beer as it is one of the best beers in the style I have ever had. If you like BB stouts this is a no brainer with a fantastic stout backbone coupled with the barrel aging makes this treat Legendary.  Bottom Line: Legendary brew!,0.571423387103043,5.0,0.972
Chocolate Rain,"2012 vintage. 750 ml bottle poured into 10 ounce Kentucky Bourbon Stout snifter.  A: Pours pitch black with a cream colored head that fights to just cover the top of the beer before quickly dissipating into a nearly non-existent ring around the edge of the glass. Minimal head is to be expected from a beer of this size. Obvious alcohol legs with each swirl and sip.  S: Booze soaked dark fruits. A definite port-like character. Dark chocolate and brown sugar. Some vanilla-bourbon presence, but well integrated with the other aromatic complexities.  T: First impression, ""this is better than Black Tuesday."" The cocoa nib additions cut some of the intense sweetness; not to say this isn't a sweet beer (obviously given the ABV), but less so than the base beer. Picking up more roast in the back end than with normal BT. The cocoa addition is apparent with a nice bittersweet baker's chocolate presence. Over the course of this tasting, I've picked up flavors of plums, chocolate, caramel, burnt chocolate, coffee, and vanilla throughout. Ends milk chocolate and espresso, followed by alcohol warmth.   M: This beer is about as thick as it gets; borderline syrupy. Minimal carbonation and slick on the tongue. An appropriate mouthfeel for supporting the massive flavors and complexity of this one.   O: Excellent beer, one I prefer over the 10 and 11 vintages of Black Tuesday (the only vintages I've had).",0.6530262174315397,4.75,0.972
Enjoy By IPA,"Canned 3/14/18, consumed 3/25/18  Poured crystal clear honey amber with a decent head that left good lacing.  Aroma is a heavy but balanced whiff of danky and piney hops with citrus fruit. West Coast style amplified.  Taste follows aroma, but the malts come in here. Slightly less fruity than the aroma.  Mouthfeel is heavy, solid bitterness, but everything feels smooth with a clean, dry finish. Nothing lingering.  Overall, a very solid and strong West Coast DIPA offering from Stone. I find their regular IPA to be a bit too bitter; this one here, although much stronger, is far smoother and more balanced. Great price for a tasty, strong DIPA, also a plus.",0.7377858193764889,4.5,0.972
Mastermind,"A: Pours a very pale clear yellow with minimal white head and decent lacing. S: Super lemony very different from most ipas, almost like candy, with maybe some grapefruit to it T: Lots of lemon/citrus again just like the nose. Not much hop/dank flavor i love in ipas. Tasted almost like a session to me. But a good lemony/hop aftertaste that was very unique. F: Pretty good little too much carbonation a little to much stick to it.  O: A very unique DIPA, not really a hop bomb but instead very lemony and kind of candyish, reminds me of grapefruit sculpin.",0.6517773868455594,4.25,0.972

Peche 'n Brett,"Bottle Date: best by August 2022 Palate Contaminants: none  Color is light gold. Opaque glow. Fair amount of fine head.  The smell has both citrus acidity and some lactic element. The peach blends well with that acidity. It doesn't hang around as long as I'd like.  Very light funkiness in the taste. Sometimes I get a candy taste, and for this one it's Smarties. Moderate bitterness. The peach is diminished from what was on the nose. Slight honey and plums as it warms. I hope I didn't wait too long to consume this one. (On second thought, the bottle does say that the ideal serving temp is 50-65, and I am noticing more intensity as it warms.)  Carbonation is plenty prickly. Alcohol is very well hidden for a tenner. There's more sweetness in the aftertaste than in the taste. Moderate astringency.",0.6794457848454505,4.25,0.9719
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Solid dark brew, topped by a good size lighter brown head. Very good retention, and wide fields of lacing.  Nutty, boozy aroma. Honey, roasted malts, nuts, caramel, coffee, alcohol, oak, bourbon coming through relatively mild, but building with warmth.  Very smooth flavor. Sweet, but not overmuch. Roasty, but not exceptionally bitter. Strong bourbon notes, but not overpowering or too sickly-sweet.  Chocolate and coffee from the malt; vanilla, oak, and bourbon from the barrel; nuts, honey, and toffee.  Unbelievably smooth mouthfeel; 11.9% and you'd never know it. Silk. Could be a touch thicker, but it's far from thin (think: cheaper, thinner egg-nog, whereas Ten-FIDY is the good stuff).  I guess if I have a complaint, it's that the brew comes across very, very smooth, but not particularly deep or complex. I would love a slightly stronger stout base for the brew; the barrel character in this one is very well integrated, but I don't get as nuanced or complex a flavor profile as I do in FW brews or BCBS.",0.7155157395966665,4.5,0.9719
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"2016 bottle at Toppling Goliath poured into KBBS glass.  Wow. Just wow. I don't know if it's even possible that a better beer exists. Pours like Motor oil. Smells like you opened a bottle of maple syrup with coffee crammed inside the bottle. Taste follows the nose. Pure maple that lingers for a while after you drink it. Feel is the thickest most viscous drink I've ever had. Only thing thicker is actual maple syrup. Overall, this is hands down the best beer I think I will ever have. Worth everything you can give up for it. Well done, TG!",0.5795001126536189,5.0,0.9719
Nelson,"Again, of the four Alpine beers to recently hit Atlanta thanks to the Green Flash relationship, I like this and Hoppy Birthday the best.  This is a phenomenal brew with some of the most beautifully integrated contrasting flavors you will ever experience. As some others have said, it does have an almost wine/champagne quality to it in addition to just being a West Coast IPA hophead's delight. Love it!",0.6253538693593984,4.75,0.9719
Very GGGreennn,"Perfect hazy yellow color. Beautiful sweet and bright to nose, thick and smooth body. Sharp and crisp taste with a still present hop bite. Perfect for anyone who likes this hop profile. Also, love the 5th element quote on the can “Corbin Corbin, My man I have no fire.”",0.6642257272938542,4.75,0.9719
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Poured from fridge temp. Pours jet black with very little head, even on a pretty aggressive pour. Nose is coffee upfront, and a lot of it. Amazing. Also getting good amounts of bourbon, chocolate, and licorice. Some dark fruit in there too. Taste nicely follows the nose. The mixture of coffee, licorice, and bourbon is outstanding. Top notch stuff. A bit of bitterness (perhaps from the coffee) and alcohol burn, but all of this is very welcome. Fantastic stout with an incredible mouthfeel - thick and creamy. Highly recommended.",0.6587888083292481,4.5,0.9719
Enjoy By IPA,"(For the 10.31.19 version): this one is the best of the series since last year's July 4th version. Pours a gorgeous golden color with a decent head. Nice lacing. The aroma is pure heaven: some maltiness and resin up front, and tropical fruit noticeable. Taste is incredible: a veritable hop explosion, with peaches and those same tropical notes more pronounced. This is a dank brew with a pleasing aftertaste as well. Get it and enjoy, while it lasts.",0.665465071510558,4.5,0.9719
Sip Of Sunshine,"I'm just going to give this all fives. I can't really find fault in anything about this beer unless I wanted to be super picky. Nice golden beer with a sticky, fluffy white head that may leave more lacing than any beer I've seen. The aroma is a heavenly blend of floral scents, citrus, pine and malty sweetness. The taste is sweet citrus that is washed away with pine and pith in a magical dance on your tongue with a nice bitter finish. This beer is amazing.",0.6556226419538217,5.0,0.9718
Mastermind,"12 oz can poured into water glass canned on 7/24  A: murky gold colored with a small bubbled head that disappears to a film  S: This smells like grapefruit with lots of lemon squeezed in has a very herbal smell about it as well. I wonder if it is the yeast giving it such a depth of character on the nose with the earthiness  T: like drinking the pulp out of orange juice very citrusy with a huge herbal tea quality to it with a ton of lingering grapefruit peel esters on the tongue with a depth of earthiness to it that keeps bringing more flavor. Picking up some melon taste like honeydew as well.   M: very heavy for an IPA this coats the tongue and gives it a richer deeper taste  O: I can't pinpoint exactly why this beer is so good but it definitely is! its not juicy as so much as it is thick with deep citrus flavors counterpointed by an herbal depth that gives it almost a slight earthy taste. Its so complex its fruity, but piney, earthy, herbal and slightly floral all at once. And that full heavy feel on the tongue is just outstanding. ABV is very well hidden as well.",0.6891266793167095,4.75,0.9718
Black Tuesday,This beer is a really hard one to rate. Currently drinking a 2015 bottle and it's nice however like most of the bruery booze bomb of beers they are hit or miss. You can get a 2013 bottle and if it was just straight booze back then it's not gonna turn into something magical I believe. I'm drinking a nice bottle but I've definitely had bottles that were borderline hard alcohol tasting. That being said I don't think this beer gets the respect it deserves and used to get. Definitely worth going after. In the world of hyped up beers I feel like you could roll the dye and get 2 bottles and 1 will be right up there with some of the best bourbon beasts.,0.5031566973134939,4.25,0.9718
Aaron,"Bottle: Poured a cloudy brown color ale with a nice dark white foamy head. Aroma of caramelized malt with residual sugar notes and nice bourbon and oak notes. Taste is also a nice mix of caramelized malt notes with some bourbon and vanilla notes, light residual sugar notes with nice oak finish. Body is full with good carbonation with smooth warming alcohol notes. Incredibly well-balanced with super great level of complexity and drinkablity.",0.6849999696903779,4.75,0.9718
Haze,"Great beer. Not sure how it's currently 100 rated, but it for sure is an excellent beer. What separates this beer from other stellar offerings from Alchemist, Trillium, Other Half etc... is the resinous finish. It finishes with a strong bitter, resin taste but it quickly dissipates. Outstanding smooth mouth feel, explosion of hops and fruits in the taste and smell. Excellent beer, well worth the wait.",0.6573398973691253,4.5,0.9718
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"This was my first beer of the day at the release.   Poured into a brand new Toppling Goliath snifter.   Almost a finger width of head, very brown head with good lacing at the top of the glass. Some beer got on my hands and it was very sticky.   Smell is of smooth bourbon with a hint of dark chocolate. Very sweet. The bourbon has no pepper smell.  First taste of the day was sweet dark chocolate filling my mouth with a creamy texture and just a little coffee/espresso around the edges not hurting the deep chocolate notes at all. nSubsequent sips brought out more of the bourbon flavors.  Mouthfeel is smooth and rich with viscous, thick body. The first drink was similar to the feeling of drinking the first few sips of coffee with a whip cream topper.   Overall I loved it for it's deep savory flavors of coffee and dark chocolate with a body to hold those flavors together. The difference from Assassin to KBBS is that vanilla is the biggest flavor in Assassin and KBBS has a deep rich chocolate/coffee flavor that is distinct.",0.6428248044203756,4.75,0.9717
Swish,"16 oz can gifted by a friend. How did I not know about this one!?!  Pours an opaque orange/pineapple juice color with an off-white one finger pillowy head. Gotta say that the head looks unusually good on this one, though can't say exactly why. Odd.  Aroma is perfection for the juicy NE IPA style. Pungent wafts of papaya, guava, orange, grapefruit, maybe a little resinous pine.  Taste follows the aroma, but there is an alcohol taste that blends in up front - this dies down as it mellows but I feel it is out of the average for this style DIPA. In addition to the fruit flavor (more orange and peach than anything else) there is a bit of cracker coming through. The aftertaste finally allows the sweet malt to come through. Very low bitterness overall.  Feel is smooth and creamy on the tongue with a pleasant effervescent tingle throughout. It almost has a seltzer like quality to it - I like that.  Overall this is a superb variation on the NE IPA. As a DIPA it can feel a little more alcohol-ish than many of its peer beers in the region. I happen to enjoy the ones with less alcohol more but that doesn't stop me from rating high for what they intended - which is the quintessential juice bomb.  I see the Bros rated it down - typical of them for this style. I'd be curious if that 85 rating was based on a comparison to others of the style or just reflects a bias against the style as a whole. Either way they are way out of whack with the general population here.",0.688363022929513,5.0,0.9716
Enjoy By IPA,"Review is for the Enjoy By 07.04.19 unfiltered ipa. Packaged in Richmond Va., 05-28-19. A- Nice, lightly hazy amber pour. White, frothy, almost creamy, head that dissipates to a soapy ring with moderate, soapy lacing. Inviting. S- Delicious, inticing nose of peach, pine, and a light, underlying earthiness. T- Quality is apparent from the first sip. Nice sweet/bitter balance. Citrus and stone fruit flavors up front, chased by pine and grapefruit peel. A tiny bit of peaty earthiness and some maltiness in the finish.  M- Moderate, resiny feel with no syrupy quality sometimes found. O- Excellent. Great balance, rewarding flavor...a sneaky pete at 9.4.",0.6958406009055109,4.5,0.9716

Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"BR 2 2014. rich, smooth, good barrel presence and not hot like some barrel aged stouts can be. nice mouthfeel and even at the end a swirl in the snifter still produced a nice fluffy head. i'm a bit more critical when a bomber is at this price point, but this still impressed. a nice treat and up there with some of the best in the style.",0.6769424129085686,4.5,0.9716
Todd The Axe Man,"Had on tap at the Firehouse in Normal, IL.  Look - A cloudy gold color with a mild white head that hangs around for a while.  Smell - Strong resiny pine notes with hints of citrus. Yep, it's an IPA.  Taste - The usual hoppy bitterness hits first, but then the tongue is wrapped in a cozy warm malt blanket as time goes on. Could use a bit better balancing, but it's a fairly decent and progressive taste profile.  Feel - Medium body and medium carbonation keep it lively enough without being too much.  Overall - A pretty good IPA, and that's high praise coming from somebody who isn't that fond of hoppy beers. It is annoyingly expensive though, which has kept me away from it for a while.",0.6940105648262436,4.0,0.9716
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"The beer pours out extremely dark black like motor oil.  The aroma shoots out of the bottle even a couple feet away as one pours it out. There's big chocolate, roasted coffee, huge caramel and molasses sweetness, and whiskey. The aroma is very well integrated of complexities.  The flavor follows with huge chunky milk chocolate surrounded by a medium roast earthy coffee and medium minus notes of whiskey. The beer transitions onto a big dark caramel sweetness with mocha coffee, a hint of berry fruits on the finish.  The mouthfeel is thick and luscious.  Just a beautifully crafted barrel aged brew. Nothing really jumps out aggressive with a harmony of whiskey, medium minus barrel notes, coffee, chocolate, and caramel sweetness.",0.6539942578073837,5.0,0.9716
Black Tuesday,"I've tasted this several times, many different batches, but this review is from notes at EBF. A thick black viscous liquid coats the inside of my glass with great legs. Aromas of chocolate, brown sugar, caramel, molasses, raisins and other dark dried fruits, along with a fair amount of ethanol. The flavor is sweet with dark and burnt sugars but that is countered nicely with a present but not overpowering alcohol heat. Roast and chocolate molasses round out the flavor nicely. Thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet syrupy mouthfeel. This is a monster of a beer, but its frikin tasty and devilishly deceptive.",0.6723680635494429,4.0,0.9716
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Wow, seriously the perfect beer. I had this 2013 bottle about 6 months ago thanks to a good friend of mine, cheers! The mouthfeel, the viscosity, the coffee smell and taste, seriously, if there is a better beer out there I would love to try it side by side with this one. My only fault with this beer is that it only comes in 12 oz. and is nearly impossible to obtain.",0.5319177163934072,5.0,0.9716
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"The aroma was a bunch of oak and bourbon, smoke, and dark dried fruits. I Think the oak was the big player for most of the beer, until it had warmed enough. This it had tons of bourbon. Very syrupy an oily looking. Pitch black with a rich brown head. Coat the plastic cup it was served in nicely. Very well balanced. Everything blended quite nice. True to the original. Oak and vanilla. Roast and dark fruit flavors. Very rich, lush, and slick over the tongue. Long finish. Top notch.",0.6976155108103967,4.5,0.9715
Aaron,"Huge thanks to bigda83 for this 500ML bottle that I’ve been lusting after for many gnat lifetimes. Bottled July 11th, 2018.   The bottle says share…I’m not doing that. The pour is a dark red mixed with dark brown, with the overall impression being dark. The nose is unexpectedly light: bits of caramel, toffee, brown sugar, & half a rack of bourbon, which is the only thing that comes on strong.   Maybe if I tell people my new kid is named Aaron, they’ll send me more of this. Because it’s pretty good. First off, it’s like being beaten about the tongue & gums with a wooden stave that’s brushed past a nice bourbon. Big, big wood with minor bourbon. The other main players are rich brown sugar, toffee, along with smoke-tinged maple & just a touch of booze. Exceedingly smooth & sweet. 500ML is the correct serving size for this baseball player.   So glad I finally had the opportunity to try this. It didn’t lead up to the legendary hype, but it’s an excellent beer that deserves to be in the top echelon of barleywines.",0.6047651241198303,4.0,0.9715

Todd The Axe Man,"A: Pours a slightly hazy medium golden caramel in color with moderate amounts of active visible carbonation rising quickly from the bottom of the glass and moderate medium yellow + pale golden yellow + honey colored highlights. The beer has a two finger tall sudsy foamy off-white head that slowly reduces to large patch of very slightly mottled very thin film covering the entire surface of the beer and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Light to moderate amounts of lacing are observed.  S: Slightly stronger than moderate aromas of juicy citrus/grapefruit, citrus/orange, citrus/lime zest, tropical/mango, citrus/grapefruit pith, gooseberry, and dank resinous hops over the top of moderate aromas of bready + grainy + caramel + honey malts with a just shy of moderate amounts of caramel + honey sweetness.  T: Upfront there are just shy of moderate flavors of bready + grainy + caramel + honey malts with a just shy of moderate amounts of caramel + honey sweetness. That is followed by moderate to strong flavors of juicy citrus/grapefruit, citrus/orange, citrus/lime zest, tropical/mango, citrus/grapefruit pith, gooseberry, and dank resinous hops which impart a just shy of moderate amounts of lingering bitterness.  M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly crisp upfront with a hint of soft/fluffiness mid-body and a moderate amount of dryness in the finish.  O: Easy to drink with well hidden alcohol and nice elements from both NEIPAs + West Coast IPAs. Pleasantly crisp mouthfeel with a hint of soft/fluffiness as well as great juicy hop flavors + aromas with some lingering bitterness. Excellent and would definitely have again.",0.6866932201406099,4.5,0.9714
Peche 'n Brett,"Had to see for myself what the hype was about. First shot at it was at the Logsdon tasting room.  Smell reminded me of peaches and cream.  First sip was alot more sour than I had expected, but once i got further into it, the flavors melded together much better. Smooth peach and funk mixed perfectly. You get the vanilla and oak in there.  The 10% alcohol that's stated to have, hidden very very well.  Overall, never had anything like this before and it definitely lives up to the hype however i've heard that this year's batch was better fresh than last years. Left the farmhouse with plenty of bottles to see how they age.",0.6367209852381109,4.75,0.9714
Scaled Up,"SOmehow eluded me all these years, this one canned Setp 28th  Pours a lighter fizzy head that fades pretty quickly like it's high abv, no lacing, murky solid orange color.  Nose big tropical mixed with pine sap, dank resin, guava, mango, orange cream, papaya, pineapple, creamy malt, a touch of melon rind and mango skin, pithy citrus.  Taste brings more of the same, pine sap a bit dank musty, not really oniony thankfully, but pine sap is big, mixed with tropical again, pineapple, Jackfruit, mango skin, big orange cream again, tangerine, pithy, some creamy wheat base malt, a touch of sweetness and little booze later, a touch biscuity as well, soft creamy malt, a bit of candied stone fruit later. Finishes a bit of booze warmth somewhat dry, lingering tropical fruits, pineapple, orange cream, etc.  Mouth is med bod, a touch of warming booze but not syrupy for what it is, a nice fluffy carb  Overall not bad, I feel like sitting on this a couple more weeks would let it all homogenize and the piney notes drop out a bit, like Julius and Green need often, but still pretty nice without being syrupy sweet or too crazy bitter.",0.6577250236498134,4.25,0.9714
Sang Noir,"2012 Project bottle into a big red wine glass.  Appearance is reddish brown with a light head that quickly dissipates. The aroma is cherry, sour, and a bit of the whiskey barrel.  The taste is amazing, and I doubt I'm up to fully describing it. It's tart and it's got the cherries. Both the wine barrel and the bourbon barrel come through, neither one dominating. It's not sweet, but there's just enough sweetness to keep this from being a pucker-fest. The bourbon influence is there, like a bass line in a rock song ... it makes its presence felt, but in the background, not the foreground. The pinot noir barrels keep this from being a bourbon heavy brew. Great blend of flavors, and a remarkable beer.  I can't remember what I paid for this (at the brewery, several months ago), but this is totally worth it. Next time I'm in Portland, I'm looking for more.",0.63637887322103,4.5,0.9713
Aaron,"From 03/14/15 notes. Big thanks to BeerWorld for sharing a bottle of this; thanks Alex! 375ml bottle into a taster.  Pours a very dark brown color with one inch of dark tan head and low carbonation evident. This one is very fruity...tons of dark fruits, oak, caramel malts, figs, raisins, bourbon, leather, bread and toffee. Medium body and low carbonation, sweet but not hot.  Overall this was very good. It has a lot of dark fruits to it, so if you like that characteristic in your barleywines, you'll love this one. Well worth checking out.",0.6366747792266855,4.5,0.9713

A: Hazy, dull strawberry. A few bubbles for the head on medium pour.  S: Mostly tart cherrie with hints of oak, yeast, and must. Touch of sweetness as well. Nice!  T: Brisk sour/tartness up-front with mellow oak and light funk towards the back-end. Not overly complex, but just right.   M: Medium bodied with almost no carbonation.

Juicy,"Pours light brown with a big frothy off white head. Great retention and good spotty lacing down the glass.  Lots of funk in the nose. Some citrus fruits combine with brett to form the aroma backbone. Can't really smell any wine barrel.  Very fruity and funky taste as well. I get some white wine components that were absent in the aroma. Good grape and orange notes along with brett and a few spices. Very smooth throughout as no one component overpowers. Not very sour at all, just funky.  Medium to light bodied with medium carbonation. A little bit slick and oily and goes down smooth.  Very well made beer, but not worth giving up an arm and a leg so thanks to chippo for the great trade. For Hill Farmstead frame of reference, I enjoyed this more than Mimosa, but still not anywhere as good as b3 Flora.",0.698101919199135,4.0,0.9712
Madagascar,"A barrel-aged milk stout is piqued my interest. The beer is 50 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The beer produced a one-finger dark brown head. The beer's head was airy and creamy. The retention on the head was feeble. The color of the beer is SRM 36 a deep brown nearly black. The clarity of the beer is opaque. The head dissipated to a ring around the glass.   The aromas of the beer are molasses, caramel, toffee, dark roasted malts, medium roasted coffee, milk chocolate, cinnamon, earthy, anise, nutty, milk, bourbon, vanilla, oranges, oak, oats, and bready.   The flavors in the beer are molasses, caramel, toffee, dark roasted malts, milk chocolate, cinnamon, earthy, oranges, anise, nutty, bourbon, vanilla, oak, bready, oats, raisins, and dark stone fruit like cherries.   The mouthfeel of the beer is creamy and chewy.   The body of the beer is full, low carbonation, and full finish.   This beer is awesome. The barrel comes through in perfect harmony. The balance in the beer is incredible. The beer is super tasty. I wish I had another bottle.",0.6359328787279881,4.5,0.9712
Chocolate Rain,"Major thanks to F2brewers for sending me this one. This beer poured out as a big black color with a light brown head that quickly fades. The smell is huge, loads of chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, booze and roasted malts. The taste is just as big as the nose. Huge chocolate flavors and lots of vanilla too and a boozy finish. The mouthfeel is slick moderately carbonated and smooth. Oily texture very nice brew. Overall what a powerful brew. Really glad I finally got to take try this. Very rich and very enjoyable.",0.6735555811704286,4.75,0.9711
Juicy,"375 ml bottle from December, 2016. Obtained in a trade. Hope it's still good as it certainly was well cared for.  L: Maybe 1F head poured into Behind the Veil Teku glass. Not much retention, no lacing, only a thing ring. Beer is a very attractive clear deep copper.  S: Definitely getting a lot of the wine barrel (guessing chardonnay) and brett. Some grapefruit and lemon, maybe.  T: Tart wine and wine barrel up front, with slightly sour citrus in the form of lemon and grapefruit along with the brett. Intense flavors, for sure, so the name is apt. Still has a spicy crispness even with some age, so I'm guessing the taste is as intended. Finish does linger despite the crispness and it comes close to running away on the tart side. ABV not really evident.  F: Light to medium bodied, mediumish carbonation. Crispy but palate doesn't dry completely, allowing for a long tart finish. Good construction.  O: Would like to try fresh for parallel tasting, but for now this falls a tiny bit behind Brother Soigne on my list of HF Saisons. As always, I believe the water is what makes all of their offerings so good.",0.6739305592533541,4.25,0.9711
Darkstar November,"On tap at Bottle Logic Brewing in Anaheim, CA.  This pours a very dark black, with a small white head and no lacing.  Smells like fudgy chocolate, rye, honey, molasses, caramel, vanilla, raisin, oak, and super well integrated bourbon.   This is a knockout BA stout. The rye adds a subtle but welcome spicy counterpoint to the sweetness from the barrel and the molasses. It's quite honeyed, with brown sugar, sweet and fudgy chocolate, caramel, and lots of bourbon. It's not boozy in the slightest though.  This is pretty thick and chewy, while remaining quite silky. There's a lower level of carbonation.  There's not much that could be better about this.",0.6535773937059154,4.75,0.9711
Beatification,"Sampled from a 333ml bottle in a chalice. Bottled on 011012.  A - Gold with a slight haze. A small head of large bubbles that dissipates quickly. But a slow steady stream of rising bubbles remains for some time after.  S - A nice mix of funk and sour fruit. Just enough to hint at what's to come.  T - This beer packs a very intense sour bite! There's a nice fruitiness (green apple in particular) too and a perceived sweetness though it's actually pretty dry.  M - Moderate consistency with a low to moderate carbonation.  O - A fantastic sour! But then again, I wouldn't expect anything else from Russian River.",0.6652549323601532,5.0,0.971

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"750mL red wax 2012 thanks to a generous BA. Pours tepid muddy brune with small beige bubbles. Nose is richer, thicker bourbon, rich hazelnut, amaretto, marzipan. Very nice aroma. Taste is sticky, big ass maple, spicier. Thick and rich. Not metallic or thin like other DL variants.

Had at a 4 person-4 bottle share: Barrel Aged Dark Lord '16, French Vanilla Militia '17, Marshmallow Handjee '17 and Barrel Aged Abraxas '17 (in that order).  Pours pitch black and extremely viscous with no foam head. It was so viscous, I thought it was going to stain the glass! Extremely pleasant bourbon sweetness aroma. Not boozy! It was like BCBS on steroids. Taste had a good amount of barrel presence, nutty, oaky, chocolate and sweetness. Really thick and sticky. Basically after the first sip, my lips started sticking.   This finished as a consensus 2nd out of the 4 (only behind Marshmallow Handjee '17). It exceeded everyone's expectations.

Fort Point Pale Ale,"Canned 11 days ago.  L -- Moderately aerated pour produces a skimpy one-finger white head atop an effervescent turbid orange. Not quite as hazy as Trillium's IPAs, but still very clouded. No retention or lacing S -- Big orange, grapefruit, pineapple, and peach. A hint of soap as well T -- Bright, elegant, and refined. The tropical fruits from the hops really dominate the flavors here, with very little residual bitterness. The biscuity malts give a nice dry character that further accentuates the hop profile. Some green/grassy/herbal flavors on the finish F -- Each sip is a juicy bomb that washes my tastebuds in a gentle fruity hoppiness before finishing dry but not bitter O -- If Trillium could figure out a way to reduce their pricing by a few dollars per 4-pack, I would be buying this by the case as my summertime go-to. Or maybe they could start subsidizing their beers for their lower-income fans ;)  89/100  EDIT(12/8/18): Canned 10 days ago. Trying a batch that was I believe brewed on the new Fort Point system. A bit pinier, rindier, and yeastier than I remember, perhaps due in part to the new fermentation profile. Still very drinkable  EDIT (3/10/19): Had on tap at Fort Point. Much better than the last batch I had and aligns solidly with my initial impressions. This stuff is really quite excellent given that it's their 'standard' beer",0.685006639896428,4.25,0.9708
Space Trace,"Original rating - on tap at B.L. 10/16 Revisited - 2016 vint. bottle pour 7/19  Score remains the same.  Black with brown head. Coconut floaties apparent.  Bourbon, oak, coconut and chocolate on the nose, in that order.  The flavor is definitely B. Trace aged german chocolate cake.  Even with almost 3 years on this, it's pretty amazing. The coconut may have fallen off a tiny bit, but it's still very much there.  Just a fantastic idea, excellently executed.  So pleased that it's aged well.",0.6006309917071477,4.5,0.9707
Second Fiddle,"I'm told this outstanding DIPA from Fiddlehead Brewing in Shelburne, VT is very tough to get outside the Burlington area. In that regard--and in others--it compares well with the legendary Heady Topper. Big, three fingered head, incredible nose loaded with citrus and pine and dangerously drinkable at 8.2%, this is an outstanding example of the now-revered NEIPA style. (It also helps to explain why that style is now-revered and wildly popular.)  On the front end, the beer has a pleasant bready character; in the middle, the citrus fruit (tangerine, orange) makes its presence known, along with some pear and pine notes. The back end has a most interesting bitter, resiny, almost wood-like finish that includes hint of more citrus, especially lemon. What was most surprising was how crisp it was. I'm guessing that, like Heady Topper, you want to drink this fresh . The layers of flavor in this exceptional beer might cause a NEIPA lover to ask, ""Heady Who?"" (although that NEIPA lover might rightly be considered deranged). Bottom line here is that you'd be a fool to diss HT, and just as much a fool to miss Second Fiddle. Big Props to Fiddlehead Brewing...",0.6697668716668168,4.75,0.9707
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,This pours so beautifully...and it smells so good. Barely any head and when I took a sip it was like heaven. It's so tasty and delicious. I'm glad I traded for this. It's a great beer and if you have a chance to drink this you should.,0.569190157233032,4.5,0.9706
Sip Of Sunshine,"L: Gorgeous dark yellow with a nice frothy head - poured from a bottle. Matches the can! S: I get a bunch of citrusy notes - something sweet in there too. T: Definitely tastes like an IPA - hoppy but easily drinkable and not bitter at all. I taste a little bubble gum even. F: Great mouthfeel- not particularly carbonated - extremely smooth. Hoppy aftertaste to some degree but after all it is 8% O: Fantastic IPA. Although I wade through IPAs less often than other beers, this is one I will drink every time I see it.",0.6558895898436712,4.5,0.9706
Space Trace,"Whoa! Seriously wow! I don't like coconut but since it isn't the dominant and single flavor, it works so well with the bourbon barrel. Super dark and motor oil thick. Velvety creaminess! Very well balanced and great sipper.",0.6999166868775648,5.0,0.9705
Society & Solitude #4,"Filled at the brewery, 10 day old batch.  Super special thanks to TheSevenDuffs for this one. Your generosity never ceases to amaze...  A- Hazy sunset hued pour with a two finger, large white bubbled head. Slowly fades to a thin cap leaving gobs of lacing around the sides of the glass.  S- Huge amounts of grapefruit, it's as if it has grapefruit juice in it. That sour, citrusy pulpy flesh thrown right in. Bitter pine and than it sweetens out with pineapple, mango and a touch of mandarin and strawberries. This truly is a remarkable smelling beer. Super citrus forward just the way I like it and the way it should be!  T- Grapefruit, mango, mandarin oranges, mango and pineapple. Very tropical but still bitter enough with the citrus and pine hop profile to make any hop head savour every sip. Lingering grapefruit finish.  M- Heavier side of light bodied, good carbonation.  O- I think I found the perfect (if not top 2) IPAs ever produced. It's literally perfect in every sense, the grapefruit is what does it for me. I used to hate grapefruit years ago but now I can't get enough, and having it jammed in a bottle of beer from a highly regarded brewery makes it even better!",0.6586517320925931,5.0,0.9705
Black Tuesday,"Rich, thick beer that flows over your tongue like a deep kiss. Full-flavor that sings of chocolate, coffee and bourbon. Absolutely amazing mouthfeel. Great for sharing with the folks that matter most to you. Not something to waste on spoiled palates.",0.6367522257162261,4.25,0.9705
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"I don't normally like Hefeweizen for its toothpaste sour yeast taste, but this one was surprisingly mild. Smooth with low carbonation and its yeast being somewhat on the milder sweet side. Funny though that the taste of its head reminded me of sweet canned corn... Altogether a very pleasant, easy to drink hefeweizen. Had two in a row on tap at a steak parlor in Vienna, AT.",0.6679524568202286,4.5,0.9705
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Not as thick as I thought it would be, but this 2014 gold wax bottle has a great amount of maple syrup. Great balance all around! Glad I got to try this one, been waiting for awhile :)",0.5371770582863956,5.0,0.9705
Sip Of Sunshine,"16oz can (3/22/17 canned date) into snifter with an agrressive pour yielded a fluffy 3 finger white head and a golden / orange hue colored beer.  I could smell the tropical fruit aroma as I was pouring the beer which should give an idea how strong of a smell it was. Mango, peach, tangerine, pineapple, slight grapefruit  Taste was good but not as much as I was hoping given the aroma. Decent hop flavor and many of the fruits from the smell were present but felt slightly muted.  Mouthfeel was on target for an IPA.   Overall a very enjoyable beer but it didn't quite live up to my expectations. I received this in a BIF (thanks Knicks!) Would not bother trading for this like I would Heady, but would surely pick up a 4 pack if I was in CT.",0.6531743999886109,4.25,0.9705
Beatification,"Bottle courtesy of nate8767; what a guy! Batch 5 (bottled 1/10/2012).  Hazy, golden yellow liquid sports a full finger of fluffy white head. Solid retention before receding to a thin white layer of foam guarding the surface. Subsequent swirls of my glass awaken the beast within. Good lace.  Nose brings the funk stronger than a James Brown album. Dirty yeast, wild funk, earth & grass, sour fruits; the whole nine yards. Just wonderful.  Sharply tart, funky, and quite sour from the start. Yeast brings in more craziness as the sour fruits make their way to the back of my throat. This incites a grainy, slightly tingly texture or sensation that I've never experienced with a beer before. Puckering sourness lingers as this brew finishes clean & dry. Can safely say that I prefer this over Cable Car '09, '10, and Izzy. Exceptional!  Slightly more creamy and viscous than a typical medium-bodied brew. Active body means plenty of carbonation, and it's done just right in Beatification. Sipping on this incredible brew makes me want to buy vacation property in Santa Rosa. That alone should suffice for my review :)  Beatification is a gueuze treading the same path as Cantillon & Drie Fonteinen, yet Vinnie and the Russian River crew demonstrate their own (masterful) Americanized interpretation of the style with this brew. A landmark American sour, showcasing what's possible in the style when you combine creativity with world-class brewing & blending talent. Ball's in your court, Belgium!",0.6761714943122278,4.5,0.9705
Madagascar,"In the minority here as I think this one is a bit overhyped. Looks the part as it pours a nice black/extremely dark brown with minimal head. Smells nice - vanilla and bourbon as you would expect.  Tastes good? Solid. I think the vanilla is a bit overly sweet and it leaves a sticky sweet, somewhat medicinal taste in the finish. Nice bourbon heat and a great thick, mouthfeel. But... Solid. Not exceptional.",0.6794799281657492,4.0,0.9705
Flora - Blueberry,"Bottle acquired from the brewery.  Poured into a HF black logo wine glass. Vibrant bluish-purple color, with a small bubbly head that almost completely dissipated, but left a sheet of fine lacing on the glass every time it was tilted in for a sip. As soon as the bottle was opened, a wave of blueberry aroma filled the air. Upon closer olfactory inspection, notes of toasted wheat and yeast funk came out, with slight hints of tart lemon and cherry. Obvious blueberry in the taste, fresh and crisp and natural, and yet still delicate and not overblown, nice lacto tartness, notes of lemon and red wine, underlying flavors of grassy funk and toasted wheat. Nothing artificial, medicinal, or jammy. Light-medium body, crisp mouthfeel, amazingly drinkable. To be savored slowly. There's no other way to say it: this beer was glorious.   As much as I want to save some bottles, I'm sure the fresh flavor of this beer will fade over time...better not wait too long to drink them.",0.6955717375572422,4.75,0.9704
Society & Solitude #4,"Canned 19 days ago.   L — Pours a wonderfully enticing pale orange haze with two fingers of dense white head produced with moderately gentle pour. Fabulous retention and lacing, this looks a lot like Green. Everything HF makes is just so… elegant…  S — Orange, clementine, tangerine, green tea, jasmine, white peach, new sneaker, light diesel  T — Green mango, unripe pineapple, dried apricot, orange pith, white bready malt, creamsicle, faint bubblegum	 F — Soft and creamy. Medium mouthfeel, medium- carb. Very restrained and gentle bitterness for the ABV  O — One of the best DIPAs I’ve had, and quite possibly my favorite thus far from Hill Farmstead. Shares a lot in common with Green, which has a somewhat similar hop profile. Very reasonable price @18/6-pack of 12oz cans   94/100",0.6729217801024711,4.75,0.9704
Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,"12oz can into a pint glass, courtesy of friend Greg. Canned 6/21/19, so 2 months old.   Bright golden yellow body, faintly hazy, decent white head which dissipates to a solid covering leaving good lacing.  Delightful aroma Pine and citrus notes fighting it out on the nose, with pine coming out just ahead.   On the taste, they battle it out again, this time citrus comes out in front. A little warmth comes through towards the end, the only hint of the abv, as this one is extremely drinkable.  Mouth between medium and full, finish a little sweet.   Overall, a very good and tasty double IPA, and one I've been after for a while. Thanks Greg!",0.6582522331782988,4.25,0.9704
Green,Another insane beer from the best. Pours a rich yellow cloud and pineapple on the nose. The first sip is the sweet pineapple with a hint of orange. Next the orange blend into a tangerine and the barely carbonated body just sits on your tongue. Like drinking a sweet orange juice. Finish stays strong and beautiful. You have no idea you're drinking almost 8%. Definitely top 20 all time brews.,0.6321936770046571,4.25,0.9704
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"From a bottle shared at la fête de la brasserie de la Pleine Lune 2019.   2014 vintage bottled in 2017.   Intense cristal ruby without any head.   The nose is powerful on the raspberry seeds, the dark raspberries and with little funk.  The taste is perfectly balanced with a beautiful sourness, some funk and a strong deep raspberry presence.   The mouthfeel is dry with a nice carbonation.   The whole thing is a fruit lambic pushed to the corner made more powerful and more balanced than ever",0.6668878839753093,4.75,0.9702
Peche 'n Brett,"Look: Cloudy, semi-opaque, bright golden color, three fingers of quickly dissipating head, good spiderweb lacing  Smell: Sweet ripe peach puree, peach jam, light farmhouse funk, melon, Brett, stone fruit, vanilla, peach ice cream  Taste: Upfront lots of Brett, cantalope, peach is lighter on flavor than the nose, a surprising amount of hop presence which helps round the flavor out. The bright organic peach, hops, and Brett compliment each other brilliantly.  Feel: Medium mouthfeel, slow drying, somewhat syrupy and coating.",0.6749984255720489,4.75,0.9702
Black Tuesday,"Poured from a 25 oz bottle into a Bruery snifter glass. Acquired in a trade from vitese, thanks buddy! One of my biggest ISOs.  A- Upon the pour a chocolate brown, translucent stream enters the glass, exhibiting a deep brown body with a 1 finger light mocha colored head that reduces slowly to leave a brown ring of foam. Little lacing.   S- Upfront come big aromas of bourbon, vanilla, maple, and molasses. Upon further evaluation, he background reveals aromas of caramel, toffee, and coffee. I get some boozy aromas every so often, but any 19% beer that doesn't smell like booze is not 19% alcohol.  T- Sweet milk chocolate and caramel upfront, next up next is coffee and a roastyness. Super sweet.. a syrupy fudgyness that coats the tongue. The finish is somewhat roasty, charred. Boozy but not too boozy.   M- Rich, thick, low carbonation. The definition of a sipper.   I was really looking forward to Black Tuesday, and it did deliver. It is on the sweet side, so if you don't prefer sweet stouts this probably isn't for you. I was expecting something more dry like BCBS, but nonetheless the flavor profile worked for what it is. Share this one or split it over a few nights, it's a meal!",0.6477784514404891,4.25,0.9702
Coconut B-Bomb,"2017 bottle, poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing nearly opaque black in the glass with a fine, quarter finger dark khaki head with great retention and nice lacing. Aroma of dark toasted and chocolate malt, cocoa, bourbon, coconut and a little oaky vanilla. Flavor is rich dark toasted malt, milk chocolate, coconut, bourbon and vanilla. Lingering chocolate and light coconut. Superb medium to heavy bodied with excellent moderate creaminess, excellent mouth feel. I can't believe I forgot to review this one and glad I had one more bottle (wish I had a case). Definitely an omg beer on the first taste, rich, well balanced, slightly sweet, but not cloying, a silky, creamy mouth feel to die for. This is a world class strong ale that would be hard to improve. And the label makes me laugh every time I see it. Thanks Fremont! I was worried this coconut version might not age well, so only got a couple. Wrong, damn.",0.6668919686928484,5.0,0.9702
Vicinity,"Bottle shared by Mike the other night, thanks man.  This one pours a pretty hazy yellow/orange, classic Trillium look, hazy and bright-looking, with a half inch head, and a lot of sticky looking lacing.  This one smells wonderfully hoppy and juicy, orange creamsicle, grapefruit, melon, tangerine, with basically no malt character, as expected.  This is classic Trillium, super hoppy and juicy, with very little bitterness. There's tangerine, melon, and grapefruit. It's got a pretty creamy, full taste to it.  This is medium bodied, with a great creamy and juicy mouthfeel, with a nice snap on the finish. This has a normal level of carbonation for the style.  Typical banger from Trillium.",0.6821413282999956,4.5,0.9702
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a Hill Farmstead goblet. A - Color of lemon zest sprinkled across honey. Gentle carbonation wanders upward. The refined cap of almost crystalline structure melts away, leaving one ring to rule the glass. S - White grape, oak, floral hops add tangerine and orange reduction. Warm wet straw hides in the back. a slightly sour tang rises as the offering warms.  T - Light grains mingle effortlessly with tropical fruits. The barrel aging is the host of the party, in taste the white wine and oak are debutantes. Burgundian quality in the notes, rich and assertive, yet polite to the guests, Pineapple, lemon tart, grape skin and light oak. M - Medium in body, full coating of the palate well beyond the introduction. Slightly tart the palate rolls out that response, and is rewarded with just enough sweetness to smooth things out. The carbonation acts as Maitre D for the evening. The feel is delicate, nuanced and to be experienced. O - This Dorothy is masterwork. The white wine barrel aging touch adds complexity and some genuine wonder. The body and feel are very much in the white burgundy mold, rich, a bit fat. All that and the dry hopping adds so much floral aromatic. An experience I will remember",0.6958176939696746,4.25,0.9702
Beatification,"Thanks to Brewstein77 for this one. Batch 5, about 9 months in the bottle at time of tasting.  Pours a very nice, brilliant gold with just a touch of orange. Thin wisp of head that quickly dissipates.  Smell is very citrusy. Lots of sour lemons, lactic acidity, limes, oranges. A touch of oak behind that and just a bit of funk behind that. As it warms I get a touch of acetic acid and a little bit of nail polish remover.  The taste is overwhelmingly sour, alcoholic, unsweetened lemonade. Nice bracing acidity, with just enough pucker factor.  The mouthfeel is very nice, very drinkable, but not too thin as some american wilds can be.  Overall, this is a very good beer however I think I enjoy the balance of the other RR sours to this one. I still have one for the cellar so I am hoping that the funk comes up a bit and gives it more balance.",0.6669101911457211,4.0,0.9701
Blanc De Blancs,"Pours a rich golden color with a bright effervescent head that recedes quickly. Smell is lemon, citrus, stone fruit, funk, yogurt. Taste is essentially like a light white sparkling wine with tart yogurt intermixed. Lots of white grape, peach, apple, pear with a creamy yogurty sourness. Really tastes like a fruit on the bottom yogurt cup. The mouthful is rich and creamy while the carbonation keeps it light. Outstanding beer. My biggest issue with Fuzzy is that the subtle sweetness of the white peaches were drowned out by the intense yogurty sourness. Blueberry Flanders had a nice balanced refreshing tartness but the blueberry flavor was a bit disappointing. This is a much better balance for my taste than both, a best of both worlds. Probably my favorite SP so far. Get it today!",0.694201524145048,4.75,0.9701
Sip Of Sunshine,"Look - poured from a 16 oz can into an IPA glass. Packaged on 8/23/18. Beer is a beautiful golden color and mostly transparent. Two finger head, with nice lacing, though it does dissipate after a few minutes. Smell - various tropical fruits, supported by a hoppy aroma consisting of a complex mixture of hops. Fairly inviting. Taste - fruitiness dominates the initial taste, followed by a wave of hoppy bitterness and several additional ""waves"" of hoppy flavor that subtly differs. A dry and slightly sweet finish in the end, topping off a very enjoyable experience. Feel - medium bodied and about average carbonation. At 8% ABV, alcohol is well masked, and the beer is very drinkable, perhaps even a bit too much so... Overall - a phenomenal brew. A double IPA that excels at its use of hops, layers of flavor, and its tremendous drinkability. Even though the beer itself is quite hoppy, this is a brew that many (including non-hopheads) may find quite enjoyable.",0.7245999722417531,4.5,0.9701
Swish,"16oz. can into a Grrrz teku.   Pours a coarse, 1.5 finger foamy white head with moderate retention. Beer is a cloudy pale lemon. Lacing is stringy and layered with great stick. Solid though the head and color could use a little work.  Notes of citrus, grapefruit, pine and starfruit. A light spritz with a mellow malt body. Moderately aromatic with a decent fruit presence.   Opens grapefruit, pine and starfruit. Juicy and resiny in the middle with a touch of grassiness and pulp. Nice malt body complements a tropical fruit hop bitterness. Aggressively balanced towards the end with just a bit of accented tartness. Aftertaste of more tropical fruit. What a juice bomb!  Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth and quenching in the mouth and crisp and aggressive going down. Dry finish with a filmy, lingering aftertaste. Excellent. Super drinkable and the alcohol is barely there.  Very very good and this one gets better and better as it warms, revealing more aspects of a tasty tropical fruit bouquet. Definitely representative of the top east coast IIPAs.",0.7209379279772036,4.5,0.97
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Bottle purchased at AJ's in Henrietta, NY, and shared last night.  Pours a rich medium red color, with visible active carbonation, a fizzy head, and a little bit of lacing.  Smells so richly and strongly of raspberry, it just leaps out of the glass, with some must, funk, vinegar, and oak.  This an absolutely delicious framboise. Huge fresh raspberry character, as I'd expect out of a 2014 bottle. Raspberry flesh, raspberry skin, and raspberry seeds all come to mind when drinking this- I also get lactic acid, a little bit of funk, and a little bit of oak. It's sour, but not overwhelmingly so, keeping it very easy to drink.  This has a medium bodied, slightly thin- not to its detriment, it is a sour after all- with a tart and crisp mouthfeel, and a higher amount of carbonation. Very drinkable, very crushable, even if you don't want to.  As I finally get to try more Cantillon, I seem to understand the allure of sours more and more. This one was so good.",0.6873783217088294,4.75,0.97
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2001 and 2002 vintages side-by-side @ the pre-Toronado 24th Anniversary tasting. I brought the 2002, but forget who brought the 2001. Poured into two mini-snifters.  A - Pours a pinkish red color, pink fizzy head, thin collar, thin cap.  S - Sharp sour/tartness, raspberries are still there for the most part, lots of barn, very funky, lots of acidity. My nose turns inside out with each sniff.  T - Raspberry purée, lots of sharp sour/tart funkiness, slight oak. Surprised how well the fruit notes have held up after all these years. An utter onslaught of raspberries, sour, and funk.  M - Light, fizzy carbonation, super dry finish.  O - I thought both 2001 and 2002 were pretty close, taste wise. I didn't prefer one over the other, both were excellent. I'll have to open a more recent vintage and compare. A must-try.",0.6402933616192387,4.5,0.97
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2008 vintage poured at Zwanze Day  Pours red/pink with a big pink bubbly head. Low retention although there was some lacing around the edges.  Great funky raspberry aroma. Funky and tart with a little fruity sweetness.  Lots of raspberry flavor in this one. Very sweet up front until some of the funk hits mid-palate. Finishes with some tasty raspberry tartness. Straight up sourness isn't as high in this as some other Cantillons, but it's still funky and the raspberry tartness makes up for it.  Well carbonated and creamy mouthfeel. Spot on for Cantillon.  I normally don't like Framboises too much, but was really surprised by this one (probably the first time I've ever had it on a clean palate). Liked it better than the other LP beers and glad I still have a bottle left in the cellar.",0.6638500310392549,4.5,0.9699
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Bottle No. BR 1. 2012 vintage kept at cellar conditions. been waiting to pop it for a while.   A: pours a dark brown, practically black. head is light cappuccino hued and remains throughout the drink. good looking brew, not much to complain about.   S: bourbon oaky aroma greats. chocolate and vanilla. smells sweet and from what I understand you cant smell sweetness. okay fine, sweet chocolate aroma. not much roast, smoke, or coffee notes in my opinion.   T: first sip is loaded with roasted coffee notes and sweet, sweet chocolate. milk chocolate. there is the mildest amount of boozy heat, but it is basically a nonfactor as this beer should have a little bit of bite. a little bit of roasted bitterness in the finish as well. but balanced by the sweetness it is not ridiculously acrid.   M: really smooth carb on a full bodied brew for sure.  D: not sure if this is super hot or even remotely hot fresh, but it has aged gracefully and I have no complaints. the booze is faint and fitting. the bourbon has diminished over time, but it's not like it is non-existent at this point. really exceptional stuff and worth checking out. the price tag was one of the heftiest I have spent at $30 for the bomber. not sure if I will be doing that again until I start making more money.",0.6378260830447782,4.75,0.9699
Aaron,This is a late review. Should have reviewed on the spot. I was thoroughly impressed with Aaron. Definitely in my top 3 BA barley wines. I feel like I may have got a bad bottle because some of the flavors feel almost like they started separating from each other disconnecting to bring out some heated ethanol qualities but beyond that I really appreciated this and it's a work of art. Worth trading for. No off coppery tastes sometimes you can get with barley wines. Pretty clean and impressive. Just below adwtd for me.,0.6199398514097775,4.5,0.9699
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"This beer pours very turbid and identical to tropicana orange juice with a fluffy 2 finger bright white head. Retention is excellent and lacing is fantastic. Smell is exactly as advertised, definitely getting the lime, grapefruit and earthiness. Taste is the same, but a little more subdued than the smell. Feel is light, soft, clean and juicy. Overall an excellent beer. Never gotten lime scent or taste before in a beer and it is definitely different. Not my favorite citrus note in a beer, but still excellent.",0.6734827627484383,4.5,0.9699
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"2018 Vintage, bottled on 10/16/18. Purchased at Loosa Brews, Tuscaloosa, AL.  Viscous, black pour straight from the bottle. Good-looking body to the beer, with small amounts of tan head that fail to rise very high at the temperature it is poured. The head settles into a very thin ring around the beer.  Right away, getting a lot of vanilla, barrel, and roasty malts on the nose. Underlying sweetness that brings out dark fruit, but a very well-balanced aromas that invite further complexity as the beer opens up and warms.  Lots of espresso flavors serve the predominant force here, but is quickly balanced out by a very potent barrel presence. Oak, fudge, and hints of vanilla weave in and out, however they never seem to gain their footing long enough to keep a consistent balance. While I love all the individual components, I just seem to be getting too much roasted malts and bourbon.  Body has a good viscosity, smooth with a carbonation that is present but not too sharp. Soft mouthfeel overall, with a lingering stickiness and fair amounts of mouth-coating. Warm booze down the hatch, The feel of this beer is definitely one of its strongest characteristics for me.",0.7047378561407379,4.25,0.9699
Enjoy By IPA,"4.20.16, opened the first bottle a couple weeks ago, this is holding up fine with a couple weeks before the EB date.  Look is clear copper body with decent, off-white head. Dissipates rather quickly leaving some spotty lacing and a thin ring.  Smell is very piney. Dank and resinish, this is dominated by the hops early, with no sign of malts on the nose,  Taste is similar to the nose, except you get a biscuity, bready flavor rather early in the taste. It works really well with the sharp bitter notes. Citrus notes are somewhat hidden, but easily detected when you pay attention.  Feel is excellent, not too heave - which is how I think an IPA should be - but plenty of malt to balance out the hops. Very sticky, long finish. Great!  Overall, you can't go wrong with this one. Its in your face, but well rounded. Alcohol is not prominent, but this is still going to be a huge beer for anyone that doesn't have big beers regularly.",0.6593523485579414,4.25,0.9699
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"750ml bottle purchased at Zwanze Day '13 at Lord Hobo. '10 vintage purchased for $45, split four ways.  A- Pours a deep cherry-raspberry red, translucent, just a faint off-white pinkish head forms that recedes to a flat top.  S- Lots of fresh raspberries, some slight raspberry purée, some slight underlying funk that's hidden underneath the raspberries. Fruity presence is very nice.  T- Fresh raspberries, a nice acidic bite that isn't too vinegary, finishes with nice funky lambic qualities of some pepper, barnyard funk, and a tiny bit of hay. Awesome balance.  M- Very drinkable, nice acidity level, nice amount of carbonation.  O- Cantillon really knows oohs to make their lambics, I prefer the LP Kriek slightly over this but both are incredible. I'd like to try this with some more age as I think the funk would come out a bit more while still blending nicely with the cherries. Not the easiest bottle to get (at least in e US), but definitely worth trying if you can.",0.6761720378665498,4.25,0.9699
Vicinity,"Mermaid Notes: Look: Looks like fresh squeezed orange juice. Just how I like it....without the pulp. Cloudy, almost milky at first glance.  Smell: If you smell it close enough its like fresh zest, delicious citrus fruit and a field of flowers. The flora notes on this beer is what hits it out of the the park for me. Yum.  Taste: Juice Bomb. Oranges, lemon , a hit a mango and pineapple with a light crackery finish that balances the hop flavor.  Feel: Incredibly smooth. Creamy and medium bodied hop delight.  Overall: Another knock out from Trillium. I can only say amazing things about this brewery. Everything I have tried thus far is fire. A seriously fruity double IPA. So juicy and dank, with a smell that is a bit addictive. Trillium, always a hit.  Cheers and stay crafty my friends. [email protected]",0.6556498255527272,4.75,0.9698
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Can received in a recent trade.  This one pours a super hazy golden yellow color, with a big one inch head, and a little bit of lacing.  Smells like tangerine, earthy pine and grassiness, some definite lime (as indicated by the can), and marijuana.  This is pretty unique amongst Trillium IPAs in how earthy and herbal it is- must be the El Dorado hops. There's tons of juicy fruity hop character too of course, but with a bitter, earthy, and dry, almost dirty feeling underpinning everything. It's very enjoyable.  This has a creamy and very full mouthfeel for the style. Like most DDH Trillium beers- it feels like I'm drinking actual liquid hops.  This is a really unique beer amongst all of the awesome uber hopped Trillium beers. I really enjoyed it.",0.67047088976865,4.75,0.9698
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2007 vintage, 750 mL capped and corked bottle.   Pours a bright, clear rose color with a large frothy pink head that quickly fades to a ring of tiny bubbles with nice lacing, though each pour from the bottle stimulates a similarly large, appealing head.   Aroma is rich and complex, dominated by tart raspberry, slightly sweet. Underneath the fruit lies a vinegary sour, earthy aroma. Amazing balance of pungent, sharp sour notes with pleasant fruity tart and sweet.   The sour lambic flavors take center stage in the beginning. After a few sips to condition the palate, the sweet and tart raspberry fruit flavors with some lemon zest emerge underneath the funk. Finish is extremely dry and smooth with lingering raspberry notes and mild tartness.  Silky smooth mouthfeel with effervescent carbonation, and is extremely sour and puckering from the flavors described above. A sipper from the complex flavors and sour/funkiness, but not alcohol presence, and pleasant bursts of sweetness make this an exceptional lambic.",0.7308460438486736,5.0,0.9698
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"750 mL bottle at Hopcat in Grand Rapids. Absolutely great beer. Plenty of funky sour plus cherries. Smell is intoxicating. Taste is even better - wonderful cherries, perfect amount of sour funk. Great beer. Highly recommended...  ...Apparently I need to add more characters before reviewing ... More characters more characters. Yada Yada Yada",0.6452924007105614,5.0,0.9698
Chocolate Rain,"2015 bottle poured into a snifter and shared with friends. The look (upon pour) was extremely dark with a small amount of head and lacing. The smell is similar to Black Tuesday; I got heavy vanilla, cocoa and semi-sweet chocolate on the nose. The flavor of chocolate really takes over here! I also noticed caramel and molasses in addition to the smells aforementioned above. The mouthfeel is definitely full bodied with low carbonation. Overall this beer is surprisingly easy to drink given its super high ABV. This one definitely lived up to the hype in my opinion. Worth seeking out, cheers!",0.6457060622001531,5.0,0.9697
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Black, soulless body with a thin, dark tan head. Everything the original Dark Lord is, both in aroma and taste, but now given a hearty soak in bourbon -- something I highly recommend. Strong bourbony accents blend in well with the other strong flavors. Thick, somewhat sticky body with almost nil carbonation. Enjoyed at this year's DLD, it really helped take the edge off standing around for hours upon hours in a line.",0.6717797067425808,4.5,0.9697
Green,"Overall great taste and finish. Not a huge nose but taste is full of happiness. Excellent, but I prefer the alter ego and the Mosaic hops aroma. So far tree house is 2 for 2. Such well balanced and great tasting ipa's.",0.681560023032306,4.5,0.9695
Juicy,2016 bottle (Batch 3) into Hill Farmstead flute bottle.  Light amber in color with a good bit of foam head upon an aggressive pour. Wonderful floral aromas and taste. Fruity flavor. Brett is present but not offensive. Not overly tart or overly acidic. Very balanced saison that is pleasant and easy to drink. One of the best I've had.,0.7179144466322981,4.5,0.9695
Haze,"The sum of its parts are perfection.  This is such a yummy beer. Please do not do anything immoral, illegal, or unethical to get this beer.  The look is nice but not exceptional  7 day old can. The smell is tropical   The taste is mango pineapple with a dry ish bite on the finish. (Alter ego style)  Just wonderful. Have had several treehouse beers this is as good as any treehouse beer I’ve tried.  If you like this style it is a wonderful treat. Feeling very sad I am out.",0.6010484954566679,5.0,0.9694
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Appearance - Opaque red, 1 finger of head which reduced.  Smell - Very strong, lots of raspberry and oak.  Taste - This has all the fruits, yeast and sourness I would expect from a genuine Lambic. It is hard to explain why this is so enjoyable despite being so sour, it just is.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, lively, very smooth.  Drinkability - Very challenging, as expected.  Overall - I imagine I would enjoy the Kriek more than this. Pretty impressive nonetheless.",0.7312564087789114,3.0,0.9694
Aaron,"This pours a beautiful mahogany with a small off white head. Some light lacing.  Smell is all over the place. Cherrys, Oak, Mild Hops, booze, caramel.  Taste is wow. I have never tasted a beer that exemplifies dried fruits as much as this. Prune, Raising, Figs, Cherries, Caramel, Mollases everything you could possibly want in a barley plus a nice vanilla bourbon characterisic.  Mouthfeel is silky. Very nice. Light carbonation.   This is a wonderful beer if not one of the more perfect beers out there. Bravo to hill farmstead on this.",0.6466547814112679,5.0,0.9694
Madagascar,"22 ounce bottle into a snifter.   Pours very dark and opaque, thick looking, with a short head and minimal lacing. Wow. This smells incredible. Cocoa, vanilla, malt, light bourbon- more as it warms, chocolate. Smells like malted milk balls. Taste follows the nose with the cocoa and vanilla, more chocolate than the nose, malt, light bourbon, a little oak. Pretty much tastes like malted milk balls. Smooth, creamy, great body, well carbonated.  This is one to look for. The vanilla is outstanding, the rest of the flavors are intense and well blended. The bourbon was subtle in this bottle, but it still had a positive impact. Price point was reasonable for the quality. Will definitely buy this again.",0.6764886517518247,4.5,0.9694
Sang Noir,"Very dark mahogany color. Pretty much a perfect balance of wine and bourbon barrels, with a natural-tasting cherry flavor being led by above-moderate tartness and gentle carbonation, at a perfect level to allow for the enjoyment of juicy cherry, bourbon-y malt, and generally all-around pleasant flavors.",0.7132660113432064,5.0,0.9694
Chocolate Rain,"Look-color is a surprisingly clear, lightish brown, not unlike milk chocolate, no head at all save for a few stray bubbles. Smell-TONS of sweet chocolate, booze, and vanilla. Taste-Loads of milky chocolate upfront, faint notes of caramel, vanilla, some coconut in there as well, and a slight touch of alcohol but nowhere near the level you might except from a beer this big. Feel-Very thick and creamy, very faint carbonation. Overall-This beer is a wonderful treat, hopefully i'll be lucky enough to try it again sometime.",0.63429869697364,4.75,0.9694
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2007 vintage bottled in 2009  a: This was a dark, kind of murky pinkish purple color. It poured with a short lived, fizzy pink head.  s: Very vinegary overall with plenty of raspberry aromas coming through as well. I couldn't find all that many layers here, but the smell is wonderful.  t: Starts off with strong, vinegary flavors. The raspberries come in at the end without a trace of sweetness. Exactly what I hoped this would be.  m: Fizzy, tart, and refreshing.  d: Not much else to say about such a great beer except, the heart-burn is totaly worth it.",0.6507419698116176,4.5,0.9693
Sip Of Sunshine,"Had a pint of this poured from the draft tap at Agava on East Hill, Ithaca, NY. Holy smokes! What a delicious brew! Lovely slightly turbid lupulin particulate opacity, good head retention, superior mouthfeel. Bittered enough though featuring floral, fruity, complex hop aromatics. Bartender made sure to note that this great ale was not included in the Happy Hour discounts, but who could complain as long as it still poured for us? Definitely a great IPA! And brewed just 265 miles from here!",0.6519393263105699,4.75,0.9693
Beatification,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Utopias sample glass. Acquired in a trade from hwy395.. thank you sir!  A- Pours a slighthly hazy, super carbonated, pineapple coloorred body with a fizzy white 2 finger head that reduces to a white ring. Leaves no lacing.   S- The first thing I notice upon popping the cork is a strong champagne-like aroma, grapes and white wine. After pouring it and letting it sit, strong lactic tartness, leather, lemon juice, citrus zest, and a distinct earthiness.   T- BOOM! The mouth puckering sourness that kept me seeking this beer out hits you the second it touches your tongue. Straight lemon juice, vinegar, sour apple hit you in face, followed by a earthy, leathery notes complimented by oak and subtle Belgian spice.  M- Crisp, refreshing, highly carbonated. Dry finish.   I've been waiting to try this beer for almost 2 years now. What differentiates it from other Wild Ales I've tried is the mouth puckering sourness that it delivers. As with other RR sours, it was very well balanced and complex. This one's a winner.",0.6624530931359033,4.5,0.9693
Black Tuesday,"L: Most people have this as super black, but when I poured it, it look very dark brown. Although in my glass it looks really black. It had a decent amount of light tan head that faded quickly. S: This thing has everything here: Chocolate, bourbon, oak, caramel, vanilla, dark fruits and roasted coffee T: This thing starts out really hot with bourbon and chocolate. When it warms up all those other smells start to seep out and taste amazing. I get bourbon, oak, vanilla, caramel and some dried cherries on the end.  F: This thing is a little on the lighter side for a BA stout, but it is very smooth and creamy.  O: I could see some people not loving this because the bourbon is very present, but as someone who drank whiskey before I found craft beer, this thing is amazing. I liked it a lot when it was straight from the fridge and I loved it once it warmed a bit.",0.6043894154129706,4.5,0.9692
Enjoy By IPA,"22 oz. bomber poured into a tall Riedel Pilsner glass.   Pours crystal clear with a nice bright white head. Lots of lacing. Smell is unremarkable. Moderately sweet up front, followed by a sharply bitter back. Bitterness is akin to grapefruit peel. Has a great texture and weight -- crisp due to great carbonation with a medium body.   This is a great beer, but lacks aroma. Tastes very good, but that 'something special' is missing to make it a great beer.",0.6998467070951719,3.75,0.9692
Society & Solitude #4,"Growler  Thanks for sharing this with me, corregidore!  Hazy yellow and light golden with a moderately sized near-white head eventually leaving lines and spiderwebs of lace down the glass. Pretty.  There's a huge assortment of citrus/fruity hop elements in this: grapefruit, mango, nectarine, and orange; sensing a theme? There's enough bread/biscuit to backbone this nicely.  The flavor is similar to the aroma as the citrus and bright fruit/hop notes stand out, though balanced nicely enough by biscuit and mild caramel. Moderate bitterness; remarkably drinkable.  Medium bodied with high carbonation.  My favorite on a night that included many fine beers.",0.7222981744994337,4.5,0.9692
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Big thanks to some fine BA's for hooking me up with a pour of this one at Great Taste 2009. I have been waiting to review this for quite sometime after having initially at DLD 2007.  A-Deep, non-light penetrating black. A small, dark tan head dissipates to a thin ring and leaves spotty lace along with remnants of the beer, it being that viscous.  S-Whoa! Like sticking your head into a bourbon barrel filled with Dark Lord! Huge notes of oak, dark chocolate, espresso, dark fruit, toffee, turbinado and vanilla.   T-All the positive qualities of DL with a BIG bourbon pressence....and IMHO too big. FFF is never one to shy away from flavour and they didn't start with this one! I like it, but it's simply too much for me.  M-Full/heavy-bodied and Christ! This may be THE smoothest, creamy and most viscous beer I have ever had. This one slides down like oil. Rich beyond measure with LONG lasting flavours.   D-Certainly a fine brew, but the alcohol and bourbon character is a bit too much for me in this one to drink en masse. I prefer Vanilla DL over the Oaked version.",0.627556639584868,4.0,0.9692
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Vintage 12/27/07  Pours a slightly hazy gold with a nice white head. Smell is oaky and peppery with a little bit of funk. Flavor is nice, but not as complex as expecting, especially right after the Armand'4s. It's extremely drinkable and refreshing with a nice amount of citrus, oak and black pepper, but isn't all that sour or funky. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied and super dry. Overall this is a nice gueuze but not really any more impressive than the regular 3F gueuze.",0.7280636419563741,4.5,0.9692
Society & Solitude #4,"Big thanks to ScottP for sending this one my way. Hill Farmstead makes the best hoppy beers out there - super excited for another one.  Looks like a HF DIPA - a hazy golden-orange with a thin white head. All DIPAs should look like this one. Smell is awesomely fruity - you can barely even tell it's hops that you're smelling here and not a fresh fruit juice with a slight hint of spice. I've never had one quite like this before. The flavor here is also quite interesting - not exactly what I was expecting, but super impressive. Obviously it's hoppy, but the flavor is nicely complex - there is a quite noticeably an orange peel thing going on where you get both the sweetness and the bitterness at the same time. It's more on the bitter side than most of the HF DIPAs. Mouthfeel is nice and medium-bodied with good carbonation. Overall, another big hit of a hoppy beer from Hill Farmstead. This one is certainly a little unique and stands on its own.  Edit: Opening up a 2nd growler, this beer is not nearly as bitter and is significantly more drinkable than the first growler was. It's a hell of a beer! Bumping flavor from 4.5 to 5.",0.6783616337564311,4.5,0.9691
Coolship Red,"Absolutely fantastic. The body is a bold bright red, the nose funk and sweet raspberry, and flavors are firm berry tartness, strong oak, and almost sea salt. Coolship red is a true pleasure.",0.6790198031755585,4.75,0.969
Beatification,I tried this on tap at Russian river   The color is golden with great clarity and thin white head that collapses. The smell is fainlty citrus with funky lemon lactic yet slight floral aroma with mild wood. The feel has a great balance of sourness with a light sweetness and dry quality in the finish.  The flavor is a mildly sour yet enjoyable lemony tart mixed with a woody tannic flavor and some malt toward the back. This was a great treat I can't wait to have this again.,0.71716179217,4.75,0.969
Swish,"Got my first one thanks to a great trade. Was glad to get my hands on it and it didn't disappoint. I had Substance and Recip, both were good, This is my favorite of the 3 for sure.

Beer:Barrel:Time,"B1.  This one pours a menacing and dark black color, with a very small head, and a bit of sticky lacing. It really sticks to the glass - this looks like a very, very thick stout.  This smells absurdly delicious - fudge, baker's chocolate, vanilla, burnt brown sugar, light smoke, bourbon, oak, coffee, and pipe tobacco.  This is basically the pinnacle of straight up barrel aged stout, no added flavors, no coffee, no coconut, no vanilla, nothing. Even without those flavors added, you get hints of them. There's lots of barrel, with that soft vanillin/coconut and oak type flavor, and a luxuriously smooth bourbon character. This is 15% ABV, and you would never know this - it's really not boozy at all. I get a ton of deep dark chocolate fudginess, sweet and slightly cocoa bitter as well. There's caramelized brown sugar and tobacco, too, with just a wisp of smokiness. There's a feeling of dark roast coffee, here, too - this is just absurdly complex.  This is thick and just absolutely coats the mouth, but still remains pretty drinkable.  This is probably the best straight up barrel aged stout that I've ever had - no ""adjuncts"", just dope stout and dope barrel. This is worth chasing down.",0.6569586912643487,5.0,0.9689
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,Look: Truly perfect hue of brown that nearly reaches black.  Smell: A HUGE nose full of bourbon.  Taste: Chocolate and bourbon with my first tasting. After that initial kick I have been sensing more peppers in it.  Feeling: There is plenty of alcohol with the mouth feel. But the more noticeable and more enjoyable feeling is the burn in my chest while drinking this before my first bite of dinner. Even after I demolish a couple slices of pizza I still feel this very noticeably in my insides.  Overall: Absolutely awesome beer that is a well rounded beer that really connected with my taste pallet!,0.6455421753593455,4.75,0.9689
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"My first Cantillon and what a treat. A: a nice red with pinkish head S: oh wow, a funky, fruity beverage. A little oak. Just a wonderful smell T: follows the nose quite well.

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Bottled 2013  Pours deep red, with a hint of amber highlights. Frothy white head that fizzles away quickly. Not much lacing, but a tiny bit of ""legs.""  Tons of raspberry in the aroma, earthy, musty, and mushroom follow. Oak with barnyard only in the background. Tea and wood mingle with fresh fruit. Musty aged hops.  Juicy raspberries upfront. Clean lactic sourness follows. Oak and brett mingle in as well, but it's mostly about the fruit and sourness. Very very dry.  Moderately heavy carbonation. Super tannic with sourness lingering on the palate.  A fruity, tart, and complex beer. At this age it has a great balance of fruit and lambic character.",0.6801873615601082,4.5,0.9688
Space Trace,"Slick motor oil black with a loud, dark mocha fizz that quickly dies off to nothing but a faint ring and never returns. Some oily specks decorate the surface thereafter.  Smell is big, waxy, nutty bourbon and oak right up front, tickling with some heat. Unabashedly supporting are decadent notes of chocolate fudge and a touch of coconut that's not quite toasted, but comes across as though it's fresh and added to a vanilla creme frosting.  Taste begins with sweet, creamy coconut frosting and dark, super sweet chocolate syrup working with nutty, peppery bourbon and splintery oak that builds in heat to a moderate degree.  Feel is medium to full, a little slick, but also crisply carbonated, with a semi-dry finish. The tongue begins tingling from the heat after a while.",0.6558996914916347,4.0,0.9688
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Very good demure banana flavor beer with clove/bread background noise. Just not my style, to be honest. I would prefer it be a bit more balanced with malts like Schneider Aventus, but that's just me.  Have to edit:  Being a bit more refined in my beer judging now, I have to say this has some of the best looks in the glass of any beer. Great glassy, golden color and lacing. Nice head. Very light, refreshing banana flavor. Upping from 4 to 4.25",0.7010887297166435,4.25,0.9688
Fort Point Pale Ale,"I think this was my favorite during the tap takeover at Rare Barrel. Well organized event by the way.   Pours a cloudy yellow. Pretty much all of Trillium's offerings that day ""looked"" like shit, but they were all above average in every other department. Relatively thin 1/3"" white head. Aroma gives hints of citrus and tropical, nicely restrained.   As usual for many of the trillium beers, they use wheat to lighten up the malt base and stays away from heavier caramalt. Appreciated. Notes of pineapple and pine. I wouldn't describe the back end as dry, more oily than anything. A little bit of mango sweetness to it. Strong for a pale ale.",0.6753663863717112,4.0,0.9688
Oude Geuze Vintage,"2002 vintage, picked up at the brewery some years ago. This is the only vintage of the “vintage” series I didn’t try yet.  Look: pours hazy amber-yellow color with a small head that disappeared fast but leaving some nice lacing.  Smell: Strong funk, horse blanked, earth, oak, wood, fresh grass, and citrus.  Taste:Wow, this one is so smooth! Oak, earth, smooth sourness (strong sourness, but smooth), grass, citrus and wood. Tart and dry finish. Fantastic.  Mouthfeel: medium carbonation and medium body Overall: As mentioned before, I had all the available vintages until now, but the 2002 beats them all! the 2002 is a true world class beer!",0.6723273828278591,4.5,0.9687
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2006 vintage at Ebenezer's Belgian Fest, reviewed from notes.  A- Pink-red, served in my (now broken) commemorative glass for the festival. No head at all and a small ring and cloud, murky.  S- Like a gueze with some acetic. High sour is sensed. Fruit really becomes prevalent as it warms, amazing raspberry tart.  T- Better with warmth again. VERY sour. Acetic start with a great super tart raspberry finish.  MF- Light, oily low carbonated body. Smooth carbs. Sour level makes the tongue and cheek ache. Slightly creamy.  DB- Great raspberry flavor but especially aroma. The vinegar is there but enjoyable. Hard to resist a Cantillon vintage, almost always going to be a great experience.",0.6852100867332174,3.5,0.9687
Flora - Blueberry,"Poured from a 500 mL bottle into a snifter. Reviewed from notes from last night.  Appearance: Pours a deep raspberry/maroon color and leaves a finger of white head that fades to a rim around the edge of the glass.  Smell: Nice funky blueberry, grassy funk, nice mild sour aroma. Pleasant wine-y influence as well.  Taste: Matches the smell quite well - balanced funky blueberry, grassy funk, nice dry wine-y finish. Very well balanced and drinkable.  Mouth-feel: Medium carbonation with a medium, slightly creamy body. Slightly dry finish.  Overall: This is a great blueberry beer - the blueberry flavor matches the fruit not the artificial blueberry stuff. Nice and mild, with the right amount of funk and sour.",0.6912504397126429,4.25,0.9686
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Poured into a tasting glass. Nice dark red color that is slightly see through. The light pink head disappears almost completely after pouring.  The aroma is full of sweet cherry; only a hint of sourness is evident.  The taste starts out with just the slightest hint of sweet cherry. This is quickly turned into a sour cherry lemonade flavor, finishing dry and tart. This is one of the cleanest sour flavors I've enjoyed.  The body is light and the mouthfeel is smooth; most of the carbonation was lost in the pour it appears.  This is one of the best balanced fruit lambics I've had, revealing a nice sweet flavor while maintaining the wonderful yeast tartness.",0.7026867032296366,5.0,0.9686
Todd The Axe Man,"2016-06-10 16oz can purchased at a Family Thrift Center in Rapid City South Dakota, driven to Denver, and then flown to Chicago. Served in a pint glass. Dated 05/10/16. I drank a lot of this in Rapid City and brought four or five cans home.  Pours clear golden with a slight brassy tinge and a coarse, medium-sized head. Moderate to low carbonation. Smell is terrific, strong clear fresh hops, honeysuckle and flowers.  Taste is a nice blast of piney/grapefruit floral hops with a little tropical hint and a honeysuckle sweetness. Finish is super bitter.  Mouthfeel is resinous and dry. Overall, very good beer.",0.6716985132956267,4.25,0.9686
Mastermind,"From 12/14/14 notes. Thanks to BeerLawyer85 for sharing a can of this, it wads very good. 12 oz. can into a pint glass.  Pours a somewhat clear yellow color with one inch of bright white head and moderate carbonation evident. Tons of pine, spruce, citrus hops, grapefruit juice, lemon zest, oranges, and some nice tropical fruits. Also some fruity malts and bread. Medium body and moderate carbonation, no bitterness to it.  Overall really good. Not as tropical as Sip of Sunshine and more pine, but just as drinkable. Really great, well worth checking out.",0.6713176531517536,4.5,0.9686
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"750ml bottle, 2012 vintage with red wax, poured into a Three Floyds Mini Snifter.  The beer pours like thick motor oil, deep black in color, hues of cola brown with a thick khaki head that sticks around for a brief moment and leaves no lace or film behind. The aroma is of wonderful barrel presence, soft and subtle bourbon, chocolate, rich, sweet grain, soft char and some potent astringency from the alcohol. The flavors are superb, lots of soft bitter chocolate, bourbon, charred oak and vanilla, nice marshmallow hints with dark grain and dark pitted stone fruit at the finish. The body is remarkably smooth, rich and coats the mouth well. It finishes with a lovely creamy touch and a nice warming sensation as it goes down.   Verdict: A really spectacular take on Dark Lord. This beer is sweet, very sweet but still remarkably balanced and extremely complex. This was by far my favorite Dark Lord variant of the 2012 or 2013 sets and one of the more exemplary takes on the barrel aged stouts.",0.6858511562836322,5.0,0.9686
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"750 mL poured into a snifter. Appearance is an amber/yellowish gold and leaves minimal white head. Aromas of orange/clementine are strong with this one.

Even with the big bottle, you will definitely feel compelled to finish it by yourself. Definitely worth seeking out for sure! Cheers!",0.6868469035150508,4.75,0.9686
Space Trace,"Poured from a 500ml bottle. Coconut oil clearly visible, nose is all coconut. Very tasty. It was a little hot on the nose which will ease up over time, but alcohol flavor was hidden in the taste. Like most big coconut beers, it is going to be in the sweeter side. Mouth feel was perfect, not overly thick which helps with sweeter beers, but not thin by any means. Best BA coconut I have had.",0.6164340416336691,5.0,0.9686
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"This craft earth-shattering anthemic beer with vibrant depth and a forceful punch. The powerhouse beer’s defiant yet atmospheric taste is perfectly captured on its debut beer from 1040. This beer was premiered by The Huffington Post who reported, “Together, the beer and bubbles provide an aura that is subtle, unpredictable and claims no specific color. But still, it’s there, like a curious field of suppressed energy. It’s almost shamanistic.” As Bayerische Stastsbrauerei declares….“Our beer is about altering your consciousness through the sheer power of Beer…Our beers don’t deal with your politics, they question the nature of your reality.” In the fall of 2016 Leaders of Bayerische Stastsbrauerei were asked by beer label Reimagine to do a full brew of original versions of songs by The Police, a band they have often been compared to - if Sting was a high energy and inventive beer.

M - Big medium body, gentle and smooth, coats the mouth with massive amounts of tropical fruit.  O - This is a fantastic beer!!",0.6688319798141894,4.5,0.9686
Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Bottle from trade. Pours light hazy yellow with a fluffy white head. Aroma is a bit of sourness, tart brett, honey and hay malt notes, a little yeasty spice. Flavor follows with a beautiful tartness, a hint of brett, a bit more sour, honey, hay, straw, funk. Nice. Very light bodied and goes down very easy. Dry oaky body, prickly carbonation, wow. This is just really awesome. What a beautiful beer.",0.64438463872413,4.5,0.9686
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2006 vintage (i.e. bottled in 2008). Poured from a 750mL bottle into my Drie Fonteinen tumbler.   Venetian red liquid with a large, active, faintly pink head that fizzes down to a lasting collar and slick. Very light lacing.   The presence of raspberries in the nose is fleeting. The aroma is otherwise vaguely soapy, woodsy, with a hint of seaweed and pickled plum.   Tart on the palate, suggesting fresh sour cherry, lemon juice, and a hint of vinegar (though I wouldn't say this is vinuous). The oak contributes a tannic bitterness which adds a nice complexity to the lambic base. Instead of the expected barnyard funk developing, there is a secondary acidity that is surprisingly intense and lasting. The finish is bright yet almost musty or even salty - definitely has ""umami.""   Mouthfeel is a touch astringent and maybe a little oily.   There is an underlying sweetness from the fruit that never quite comes to the front of the flavor profile but keeps eluding you as you slowly sip away the bottle.   An excellent aged framboise, but there is room for improvement. Perhaps it needs more time to cellar (or maybe it is better when very fresh)?",0.6937437852285315,4.5,0.9686
Enjoy By IPA,"One of my favorite Enjoy Bys. Diverse hop profiles.  Poured a light golden color in a Spiegelau glass with a 4 finger head. Excellent head retention. The head lasts few minutes.  Wonderfully floral bouquet. Spice.  Very carbonated, spicy.  Grape, citrus taste. Before warming, the taste is dominated by hoppy spiciness. Grape and citrus, and a smoother MF come into play with warming. Spicy hoppy finish.  Overall, an excellent excellent+ beer.",0.7121180881270146,4.25,0.9686
Swish,"Enjoyed at Black Birch  A - Poured into a standard tulip a nice crystal clear golden hue with a nice white head that fades to leave thin blanket.  S - Aromas of citrus galore, oranges, lemons, light tropical notes. Faint malts, really bright.  T - Taste is similar to the nose loads of citrus rind and flesh oranges, lemons, tropical fruits, light fluffy malts. Really tasty.  M - Mouthfeel is fluffy, lightly carbonated. Alcohol hidden well.   O - Overall this beer was quite tasty, great citrus and tropical notes. Well done double ipa.   Serving type: On tap",0.6769518948257945,4.25,0.9685
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"12 oz. bottle. Black with a nice khaki head. Smells of whiskey and strong roasted malt. Some molasses, but not too sugary smelling. Tastes of licorice, molasses, heavy oak. Bourbon is kind of a burner in the back end. The bourbon is a little rough, but it's nice. Heavy and definitely a sipper. Happy to have an imperial stout that isn't stupid sugary.",0.6095601849626288,3.75,0.9685
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"This is one of the juiciest IPAs I've ever had, lots of mango and orange flavor. Reminiscent of a creamsicle, but in a good way. Lots of tropical fruit in the aroma. So easy to drink, I drank this a lot faster than I had expected to, it was just delicious and smooth, a real pleasure.",0.6651533860870921,4.25,0.9685
Peche 'n Brett,Really was looking forward to trying this one! Tried alongside three other peach beers...this one smoked all of them… Hands-down the best peach beer I've ever had as well as the best Brett beer I have ever had and I have had many! Absolutely wonderful nose on this one and rhe palate was even bette with tons of Peach and just the right amount of complimenting Brett!!! Well done!!!,0.5887282450602671,4.5,0.9685
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"12oz bottle into Tulip  Bottled on 10/16/18 Pours dark brown with a dark brown head that dissipates quickly  Chocolate, vanilla, fudge  Dark chocolate, raisins,  vanilla and oaky finish  The feel is full bodied yet super drinkable for a 13.4% BBA stout Overall this is one of if not the best BBA stout I've ever had. This tastes like expedition barrel aged, but the barrel only implies subtle notes, so it's not a new product, but a great one amplified. Super balanced and super drinkable.",0.6648061325265866,4.75,0.9685
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"This beer was nothing short of spectacular. A deep, rich black color with fantastic lacing. The nose was unctuous. There was big wafts of maple syrup, fudge, vanilla and a perfect roast bitterness from subtle hops and perhaps the char of the barrel. The mouthfeel matched every part of the nose on this beer. It was viscous and chewy, but the marriage of all of those huge flavors kept it from being a mess, which I can only imagine how hard that had to be to brew. Huge vanilla, pancake syrup, and a roasted twinge of coffee bitterness. What a remarkable beer. I shared this with three friends at TG. Bottle courtesy of TG. What a great crew.",0.6561236667079511,5.0,0.9684
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"This is a great beer. As it warms the smells and tastes inrease dramatically. Lots of vanilla, bourbon, lil oak, dark chocolate. Lots Of SOY sauce flavor. Pairs excellent with aged sharp Chedder ,older the better also a stilton would be good. This is also went good with a dark chocolate particularly one with almonds toffee caramel. Great pairing beer. Not worth the price though 32.99.",0.6348544368703201,4.25,0.9684
Second Fiddle,"Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip glass (3 weeks old). Appearance is a fairly transparent orange brown with one finger think head. There is a beautiful floral hop aroma with grapefruit, green hop, honeysuckle, and hay notes.  Taste follows the nose with a little more malt sweetness, but there is still enough hop flavor for great balance. It is fairly juicy (not hazy), and bitterness is moderate to low. Great medium body with a nice refreshing finish. Just a great all around beer.",0.6907347401146501,4.5,0.9683
Black Tuesday,Note: 2015 bottle   Smell: huge chocolate and big bourbon booziness vanilla coconut slight dark fruit toffee oak nutty.  Taste: upfront huge malt presence Carmel toffee some nuttiness middle of the mouth big milk chocolate vanilla coconut sweet bourbon dark fruit Plum fig cherry in the finish you get some oak and sweetness with a pretty big booziness that numbs the tongue and warms the chest.  Feel: medium body a little thin but it probably helps this beer. Creamy you can defenitly tell it's a high abv beer. The definition of a sipper.  Overall: This is not a beer for everyone it's 20 percent and drinks pretty close to that. But for a 20% stout I can't imagine a lot of breweries could do this better.,0.6399474051914024,4.5,0.9683
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),Drank the 2012 bottle...Not sure how this one has not fallen off the BA Top 250 list. It was a solid BA Stout but I have had dozens of BA stouts that were better than this one. I recently had the Pappy Eclipse and it was better than this one. Shared with friends recently at a small share. Who knows...maybe the 2012 sat too long,0.4714690732601702,4.25,0.9683
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Ah yes... That expensive bottle that always just sits on the shelves. Split with my doppelganger this past weekend! 2010 Vintage! Served from bottle into a New Belgium globe. Poured ruby red with a half finger pinkish white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacint throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour cherry, cherry, and BIG funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, BIG funk, earth, and cherry. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The guys at GBX warned me that this wouldn't be what I expected it to be. I must say, they were completely correct on this fact. If you are looking for something with pucker-power, this is not the beer for you. This one was more of a fruity funkiness brew. It was really well done however, and quite enjoyable. Definitely glad I finally decided to shell out the dough on this one. Might be buying more in the future to see what that funky note does with time in the cellar based on this first taste.",0.6611063756363822,4.5,0.9683
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Description: Appearance is glassy and black with a small amount of dark, tan foam. Smell is deep and rich, with cinnamon and chilies dominating. Chocolate, vanilla and bourbon are also evident, providing for a complex aroma. The taste carries the same cinnamon and chilies, but they are extremely prevalent, to the point that the bourbon, chocolate and other underlying flavors are drowned out. It’s a hot, spicy and slightly bitter finish that doesn’t keep up with the richness of the smell. Feel is a little thin for a stout with low carbonation as can be expected.  Overall: 3.75 (This beer is good but I would not likely drink it again) Man…had high hopes for this but honestly just didn’t enjoy it that much. The aroma was great, but the taste put me off. It was too spicy/hot for me and the bourbon seemed to get completely lost. Given the BA rating and how outstanding Jackie O’s is with stouts, I apparently set my expectations too high.",0.6897161815971129,3.75,0.9683
Nelson,"Wow! This is worthy of the hype. Juicy, sweet, smooth, velvety. Layers of melon, white grapes, slight rye spiciness and hops to offset. Nice fluffy head with amazing lacing that follows you down.  Would drink again: Yes Would purchase again: Yes",0.6565936634511247,5.0,0.9682
Society & Solitude #4,Poured into a tulip. This one pours a hazy orange with a small cap of white head. This settles down to a small ring of thin lace.  The aroma has a ton of citrus with some tropical fruits. Nice bitter edge on this one. The pallet mirrors the aroma nicely. Lots of citrus and tropical fruit flavors with a nice bitter finish. This has a touch of caramel sweetness in the finish.  The body is medium. Nice and sticky with good carbonation. Pretty much another near great IPA from these guys. Real enjoyable.,0.6893920835261783,5.0,0.9682
Black Tuesday,"With much anticipation I had my first Black Tuesday last night. 2015 vintage poured into snifter  Appearance- pitch black with zero head. Exactly what I would expect from a beer this strong Smell- booze. I expected this but it is intense Taste- I get vanilla, caramel up front, barrel late and the booze hits like an iron fist. It is very evident Feel- almost no carbonation. Slightly syrupy . Overall- a special occasion beer I am so glad I was able to try. But there are better ba imp stouts out there that easier to finish.",0.6120618560878857,4.5,0.9682
Green,"1 PINT can Served in a tulip glass  This beer pours murky like pineapple juice, but a shade darker. It is topped with three inches of off white head that leaves behind some nice lacing.   I get some pineapple and pine aroma.  It starts out with some pineapple and tropical fruit. Pine comes in the middle and in the finish.   Medium to full mouthfeel for an IPA.  My first Tree House beer. It reminds me of Hoof Hearted's Roller Blabe. It is good, but it does not match the hype for my palate. I am grateful to have tried it by the generosity of a fellow beer enthusiast. I need to do more research of this brewery.",0.6239755227264404,4.0,0.9682

Mastermind,"Cans purchased at Fiddlehead Brewing Company in Shelburne, VT.  Pours a peachy golden yellow, with a fizzy and foamy 1.5 inch head, and a lot of stringy and webby lacing.  Smells just about incredible. Aromas include passionfruit, grass, pine, orange, peach, mango. Smells sticky and dank. Oh my god.  The taste is honestly out of this world. Starts really fruity up front, tropical as all hell- all of the aforementioned fruits- mango and orange being the big stars. Where this becomes unique is the finish. There's some herbal and piney bitterness near the end, almost feels like marijuana, but as you drink more, the bitterness near the end almost feels minty. I get some juniper and lime as well, near the end. Possibly one of the most unique IPA's I've ever had- save for ones with extra flavor additions. This just gets a whole ton of flavors by wringing out delicious hops.  There's a light body, with a slightly creamy and juicy mouthfeel. Goes down unbelievably easy.  This is a beer to be reckoned with. Watch out, other Vermont breweries, Fiddlehead is here to stay. This is AWESOME.",0.6498882694505267,4.5,0.9682
Flora - Blueberry,"pours out a beautiful glowing ruby color with a very fizzy pink tinged-white head. inviting aromas of berry melange, tart blueberry, green apple, earthy hay, mellow barnyard funk - smells like a country beer! the flavors follow beautifully with under-ripe blueberries, grape skin, tart apple, hay, oak, mild earthy funk, almost a musty grape quality, sweet tarts, mellow vegetal quality, supremely crisp and effervescent. ridiculously refreshing and delicious!",0.6747688316193307,4.75,0.9682

Tons of complexity going on, yet is smooth and pleasant on the palate. I have been a critic of Jackie O's BA stouts due to their price. This one is worth every penny hands down. The last 3 Jackie O's bottles I have had (Wood Ya Honey, Oro Negro and this one) have just really knocked my socks off. The coffee, barrel and base stout that went into the barrel play well off each other. It's fantastic and worth seeking~",0.5924169049195703,4.75,0.9682
Nectarine Premiere,"One of the best beers I've ever had. Simply an exquisite fruited saison. The beer's nose alone is worth the price of admission. Like you ripped apart the most juicy, ripe nectarine in half smelled the center with seed intact then ate the other half of the necterine, fruit juice rolling down your face and arms. I love it when a brewer doesn't go weak. DeGarde went ALL IN on procuring copious amount of the best nectarines available. And it will be apparent when you pour it in your glass. I highly recommend a tall, narrow glass sour the wheat glass from spiegelau.",0.6475363900594256,5.0,0.9682

S-the nose has a well balanced funk to sweet ratio. mushrooms and barnyard funk, hints of lemon are faint, notes of white grapes and a touch of oak towards the back  T-this has a good funk to it, notes of mushrooms and barnyard. A nice balance of oak with faint hints of vanilla. Lightly accented lemon, acidity, and cherries in the finish.  M-very smooth with a fuller body and lots of carbonation, prickly on the back of the throat and a very dry finish.

Todd The Axe Man,"16 oz can packaged 8/26/16.  Served chilled into a tulips glass, Todd the Axeman is a hazy copper orange with thick white head. It's settles slowly and leaves some spotty lace on the glass.  The aroma is super fresh and hoppy, dank, citrusy. Wonderful.  Flavor is sweet up front with candied citrus fruit. It leads into a strong hop bitterness but in balance with the malts.   Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. It's very bitter leaning from IPA to double IPA.  Overall a fantastic IPA that I've been looking forward to trying. I'm glad to see Surly bringing some of their best to Colorado for GABF.",0.6884416341544065,4.5,0.9681

I really enjoyed this one - even though it was a 2012 bottle, the BA Dark Lord still retained a certain high ABV-forward profile, but was equally matched with its sweet and flavorful taste profile. This is a gorgeous variant of a heralded stout in the beer world and should be relished accordingly. Beautifully done.",0.6670223021384416,4.5,0.9681
Society & Solitude #4,"750 ml growler purchased from the brewery 6 days ago. Poured in to HF stemmed tulip glass.  A - Completely cloudy medium yellow with some orange in the middle of the glass. A thin layer of white head formed and reduced to a ring around the glass. Some spotty lacing.   S - Massive grapefruit aroma up front with some peach, mango and a touch of pine. A mild malt sweetness is present as well. Very juicy and fresh nose.   T - A sharp bitterness up front that is assertive without being palate-wrecking. Grapefruit, peach and passion fruit flavours are dominant with some lighter mango notes. A fairly sweet malt backbone provides a good balance, more so than the nose indicated. As I continue to drink this one, the galaxy hops come to the forefront more so than the citra.   M - Medium body with a really big chew. The amazing and typical HF dryness is present. Full of tongue-coating hop oils.   O - Another great effort from HF.",0.6835486995271041,4.5,0.9681
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Pours a glowing raspberry red - clear as a bell. A thick but short-lived pink head, the color of a McDonald's strawberry milkshake. Thin lacing, seems appropriate. And I can smell it already...  Massive notes of fresh wood, fresh grass, and far-from-fresh fruit. Tart berry bits. Some herbal qualities are subtle... lavender, sage. Extremely unique.  Equally massive in flavor - sweet raspberry, sour white grape, exceedingly tart. So pungent... reminds me of their kriek blended with crack cocaine and pornography. Super juicy, sour at first, becoming dryer and dryer.   Pretty damn drinkable but I can't help but to sit and think after each taste. Delicious.  I approve wholeheartedly.",0.6855976898057928,4.5,0.9681
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Was pitch black in color with a brown head that retained very well and managed to leave some lacing behind. Nice aromas of vanilla and bourbon, with oak coming into play as well. There was also some roastiness, but the vanilla and bourbon seemed to be the strongest. Taste is a blending of vanilla, maple syrup, bourbon, wood, with a finish of some coffee and bourbon. Mouthfeel is thick and very smooth, the bourbon seems to almost lighten it up just a tad, however. Carbonation was on the lower side of medium. Great beer, and probably even more enjoyed in the winter months by a fire, but this sample was enjoyed out in the sun at DLD.  If you are desperate to find out what this beer is like, buy a Bourbon County Stout. BCS is 99% of what this beer is, IMO.",0.6374315671589912,4.0,0.9681
Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,"2018 release.  A: Pours an inky black with a smattering of tan head.   S: Vanilla, a bit of strong ethanol, dry oak, bourbon, dark chocolate, a hint of plum, light roastiness and coffee.   T: First impression is that this is pretty rich and sweet. Tasty melted dark chocolate, bourbon, mild toasted oak and roast, sweet plum, and finishing with a mildly tannic bitterness but balanced by the sweetness.   M: Pretty hefty alcohol warmth that doesn’t overpower the beer. Full bodied with medium-light carbonation.   O: Tasty, well balanced BA stout. Nothing mind blowing, but solid effort for sipping on cold autumn nights.",0.6873951325379231,4.5,0.968
Black Tuesday,I've had this beer a number of times and the first three times I had it twice fresh and once after two years. Each time I thought it was too boozy and sweet. I just opened my bottle from 2014 and shared it with two others (which is a must with this beer). This time it was excellent. All of the crazy sweet and boozy notes had mellowed and the base stout was apparent. All of us thoroughly enjoyed it! I recommend aging this beer because drinking it fresh is just too much. Age it for at least three years.,0.5795987173307808,4.5,0.968
Flora - Blueberry,"Poured from the bottle into a HF tasting glass.  Appeared a dark purple color with a small, off-white head.  Smelled of fresh blueberries, some tartness, a bit of sparkling wine.  Taste is delicious- fresh blueberries, solid tartness, finishes dry. Blueberry is present but not overpowering. Delicious!  Mouthfeel is light and quite bubbly.   Overall this was a special treat, one that I am thankful to get to try. Awesome!",0.6760987856542026,4.25,0.968
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"16oz can, purchased from the brewery, poured into a Trillium Congress Street becher glass. Enjoyed on 12.30.2016, reviewed from Tasting Journal.  The beer pours a turbid and hazy orange color, copper hues with a foamy and soapy white head, good retention and lace. The aroma is decent, juicy peach and mango, citrusy, but strong bitterness, very green and earthy, raw leafy hop with some lime acidity and plenty of sweet grain. The flavors are decent, really green and earthy, leafy hop, definitely overhopped, super bitter, lots of lime forward citrus with some grapefruit peel and a bit of peach character. Sweet grains, pale and soft with some NE yeast character and a bit of tropical fruit grows as the beer warms to room temperature. The mouthfeel is good, coating and thick medium body, super smooth and creamy texture with soft finish that leaves a bit of dryness behind.   Verdict: A decent IPA from Trillium, but definitely overhopped and aggressively bitter. Unbalanced in that regard and very harsh and punishing. Columbus is definitely an aggressive hop and the El Dorado doesn't do much to tame it in any way.",0.7114327397870372,3.75,0.9679
Sang Noir,"poured 750 bottle into Teku.  A - Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights and a 2 finger sandy head. Fair retention that fades into a thin ring and leaves behind some lacing.   S - Bold sour Bing cherry with some sweet jam notes. I also pick up notes of the wine from the barrels it was aged in, but almost no oak.   T - Stats off very tart Bing cherry and moves into a slighter jam sweetness. It will make you pucker as there tends to be small amounts of acid and vinegar. Again I can pick up some of the wine from the barrel aging, but detect almost no oak or wood. It's had to believe that this is 9.5% ABV as there is no alcohol.   M - Medium to light bodied with ample carbonation. Mouth puckering at the start and finish.   O - A great sour that I received in a trade. If you have a chance to acquire it, I recommend it to sour lovers. Thank you Bill.",0.621456757542585,4.5,0.9679
Green,"I've had most of TH's lineup. Including a few of the rare ipas. Green may very well be my favorite. IMO it may be the most balance ipa that they put out. Its malty yet crushable. Seriously, this is the beer that I tend to get carried away with. Its very juicy, I get the pineapple juice comparison like crazy. It also has a very nice hoppy aftertaste. It is a little dank and I love it. I can almost find julius and alter to be a little thin. Green really skirts the line between an ipa and a double. Like all tree house ipas the smell is obviously great. If anything this is one of the better ones. It'll lace a glass like no other. If I could get only one tree house brew regularly, this would probably have to be the one. Its just so well balanced and always scratches the itch no matter what mood I'm in.",0.6466487252512427,5.0,0.9679
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Pours a matte bright golden yellow color. Thin off-white head dissipates steadily leaving a ring of foam along the outside of the beer. Smell has notes of orange and grapefruit with some lime and that dried out hop aroma you get in DDH beers. Taste follows the nose with notes of orange, grapefruit, lime, and a biscuity malt backbone. The dry hopping provides a strong hop burn but not much bitterness. Feel is light and smooth. Moderate to medium carbonation - a bit fizzy on the tongue. Overall a fantastic IPA from Trillium - very nice use the DDH with this one. Definitely worth trying.",0.6805552543519013,4.25,0.9679
Todd The Axe Man,"Tried this some months back, in a can that the owner admitted was several months old and wasn't very fresh. However, relatives from Minneapolis brought out a fresh can for me, and the difference was night and day.   The beer pours a slightly hazy light orange amber color with good head retention and lacing. On the nose, you can tell right off this is going to be a pretty tasty IPA. There's dry citrus, moderate tropical fruit and a boatload of pine. A hint of dankness in the aroma profile rounds out the impressive nose in this beer. However, as good as this smells, it tastes even better. The flavor profile generally replicates the nose, but there's just more of everything. The finish is dry and refreshingly bitter in this excellent beer. Alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile in this intensely flavored IPA, and drinkability is terrific in this fairly full bodied beer.   Quite excellent. This reminds me very much of fresh batches OTWOA I've had from DC Brau. Very impressive offerring from the folks at Surly.",0.6990081287491352,4.5,0.9679
Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,"2018 Bottle.  Dark, viscous pour. As the beer fills the glass, formations of tan head rise and dance on top of the beer, settling into a small ring around the rim of the glass. After a few minutes it dissipates into a flat, black abyss.  Huge amounts of dark fruit and barrel influence to the nose of this beer. To compliment those notes of plum and molasses are solid undertones of bold, dark chocolate and black licorice. Subtleties of oak and vanilla emerge as the beer continues to warm.  Again, the barrel really shines here. A more rugged flavor profile, with smoked oak and leathery tobacco playing at the forefront. Behind it there's a softened, sweeter characteristic, resonating with notes of caramel, vanilla, milk chocolate, brown sugar, and molasses. Together they balance each other perfectly, with the barrel influence preventing too much of a cloying sweetness on the palate. After letting your taste buds settle for a moment, there's a very present nuttiness to this beer as well, a roasty quality that further adds to the complexity of this beer.  Viscous, soft, and sticky. A full-bodied mouthfeel, with a very soft yet still noticeable carbonation that clings desperately to a boozy warmth that catches you in the finish.",0.6815888798578249,4.5,0.9678
Black Tuesday,"Such a unique beer. Almost like a stout liquor. Amazingly smooth for the alcohol content. Rich thick molasses flavor that never let's up. A truly great beer! Compared 2014 edition with 2014 BCS and this won out, though both are great.  Had 2015 version with 4 months of age. Good, though not as good as previous versions.

Enjoy By IPA,"Nice, golden hue with a good head; I can see floating sediment and evidence of the lack of filter. I love the sweet smell with a hint of orange. It has a full-bodied, yet light flavor. Can't taste the alcohol at all, but I can definitely feel it. Nice, hoppy taste. Will definitely enjoy again.",0.6733762792812313,4.5,0.9678
Green,16 oz can from 1-4-17 poured into a snifter  Appear: A hazy dense citrus look with a 1-2 finger amount of thick white foam. As soon as you see it you want a drink  Smell: A piney smell with a super blend of citrus. There seems to be some tropical notes in there with slight grapefruit. Again the smell says hurry and take a drink.  Taste: Has that West Coast flavor with more grapefruit flavor than the smell led me to believe. Really hoppy flavor that blends nicely with the citrus. There is some orange in their with the pine and other citrus notes. Great blended taste consistent through the glass.   Feel: Smooth with a hoppy bitterness thrown in. Not really thick but not leaning that way.   Overall: Fantastic complex brew. It has the hops I really like with a citrus blend that make it so drinkable. Another great Tree House brew.,0.7038314204702617,4.75,0.9678
Peche 'n Brett,"750ml bottle poured into a snifter. The brew appears a hazy orange with a solid white cap 2+ fingers strong that is composed of large bubbles and holds seemingly throughout the entire duration.  The aroma contains earthy brett upfront with a light fruit essence like apricot/peach but without getting sweet smelling. There is some funk and oak that blend into the brett that almost imparts a feel of sulfur.  The taste includes plenty of wheat and faded fruit that is like peach/apricot skins. It is somewhat carbonic and lightly mineral filled just like the base saison (which I wasnt crazy about.)  This is a lightly watery feeling brew with an abundance of carbonation. It is sadly cabonic an overall just ok. I have tried to approach this brewery with positive anxious thoughts but everytime I try their goods, im left underwhelmed. I would drink this again if given the opportunity but really, I dont see this as anything special or worth going out of your way for. Perhaps this was an off bottle?",0.6754366148841616,3.75,0.9678
Swish,"I was fortunate to get my hands on Swish from Bissell Brothers via a trade and I drank it last night. I poured it in a beer mug, which was the only clean beer glass I had left last night. What a wonderful IPA!  (L) The color was cloudy dark golden, almost light brown, with an inch white head that dissipated fairly quickly.  (A) It had a wonderful piney and fruity aroma.  (T) The taste was a mix of tropical fruit and citrus evolving and ending in a grapefruit taste and a pleasant moderate dankness, very well balanced. There was not any hint of the alcohol.  (F) Creamy, juicy, smooth, moderate carbonation, easy drinking yet very tasty.",0.6876122222199456,4.75,0.9678
Madagascar,"L: black, but not the blacklist. Poured like a stout, but not an ultra thick pour. S: vanilla and bourbon. Not an intense aroma, but a great smelling beer. T: big vanilla, but little bourbon.  F: very smooth, supremely drinkable and thin for a ba stout. O: this is a ba vanilla imperial milk stout, and my best comparison is this is vanilla rye's little brother.",0.6069231698458356,4.25,0.9676
Haze,"From the 16 oz. can dated Aug 24, 2016. Sampled the same day on Aug 24, 2016.  The pour is a hazy looking yellow color under a modest white foamy head. Lingering head.   The aroma brings out orange, tangerine, peach, and citrus character mainly but there is still a worthwhile toasted bread and biscuit character worth mentioning. Zero booze for 8.2%.  Medium to full body but so smooth.  The peach jumps forward in the taste but is usurped by the other fruity character and toasted bread sweetness that hovers under it all. Mostly clean finish. Just delightful and worth waiting in line to grab one.",0.6572914835024064,4.75,0.9676
Haze,"From the 16oz can, dated 09/07/16, served in an imperial pint/nonic.  Pours a profoundly turbid orange-grapefruit colour with a generous finger of lush, creamy head. Retention is just pretty good but leaves a rich, enduring skim of suds and thick sheets of lacing. From a classical standpoint, this beer is butt-ugly; to the aficionado of NEIIPA's, it is a beverage of surpassing beauty.  The nose is sugar cookies, peaches, pineapples, and sweaty sex in a weedy ditch.  Tastes of soft, juicy, fruity yeast. Dank herbal notes, fresh white bread, pineapple, grapefruit pith, orange zest and a melange of various fermented (read boozy) tropical fruits. Ends with grass clippings and a little pine tingle.  The feel is oily and medium-heavy, very juicy but well carbonated.  All (maybe just almost all?) of the Tree House PA's share that signature, instantly-identifiable peachy-bubblegum-yeasty-somethingness and Haze is no exception. The booze is quite prominent on this one, maybe a little too much so but, otherwise, it's just SO damn good that it's hard to ding it too much for that.",0.6637062065477732,4.5,0.9675
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"12 oz. bottle. Moderate pour yields a one inch tan head over a black body with some nice lacing. Nose of caramel, molasses, vanilla, chocolate, and bourbon. Taste of rich chocolate with the bourbon's booze. After all, this is a 13.4% abv. stout! This is how I like BBA stouts! Very nice, mouth-filling feel, and overall, I wish I didn't drink this so fast. ;)  Cheers!!!",0.6023307910102452,4.5,0.9675
Chocolate Rain,"2012 Rain review side by side with BCBS 2013 and Black Tues 2012 BCBS best appearance of the group, not too impressive on appearance with no real lace but jet black but better on second pour nice lace. Smell bourbon chocolate. Taste really good a bit better than pirate.. upfront, chocolate bars dance on the tongue.. could really use some vanilla ice cream and chocolate cake to make a shake with.  Feel is thick and sweet but not disgusting like DL",0.5706873141900106,4.75,0.9674
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"this was the 2006 woodford reserve barrel-aged version on cask at dl day. poured into a clear plastic solo cup, this was unlike any beer i have ever had. dark and thick like well-used motor oil. and i mean thick. this beer just left remnants of itself on the sides of the cup, turning the cup from clear to brown. brown head. the nose was absolutely huge, dominated by the whiskey notes along with chocolate, coffee, vanilla, smoke, toffee, and raisins. taste was a huge malt sweetness balanced a little by the 3f hops and roasty malts, but more to the malt/sweet side. mouthfeel was more viscous and thick than i have ever experienced. this had very little carbonation from the cask leaving it thickly sweet. long, long finish is ended by whiskey flavors and warming alcohol. still somehow smooth, though. this took a while just to drink a little bit and i probably could have just one of these in a sitting. a real sipper. update: have had a few more of these, carbonation has been better, would add some serious charred fruit to the above. have enjoyed it more from the regular taps with the added Co2.

All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"I got this accidentally... was standing in line for other things when they announced its availability.  L: jet-dark brown. Totally opaque. Pours with a thick head that mellows out over time but takes a long time to totally dissipate. Thick on the side of the glass while swirling. S: Sweet, dried dark fruit, some roastiness. Wonder if I'll need insulin after this. T: Holy moly. I love this beer. My wife took a sip and asked me to drive her to TH so she could get her allotment. It's 28 min away. I did. We had ""his and hers beers"". Yeah, it was that good. The creamy taste with the hint of roastiness, chocolate, coffee (thought this isn't a coffee stout). All blended well. To me, this is one of the best beers I've had by Tree House. I'd pass over Julius for one of these on even the hottest days. F: thick. Creamy. The flavor lingers for a long time. O: I got mine. Then went back the same day with my wife. Went back the next day to get more.",0.5844966211509005,4.75,0.9672
Scaled Up,"Poured from bottle to a snifter.   Looks like orange juice. Smells like glorious bready malt and citrus. Tastes like grapefruit, mango, orange and peach with a slight hop bitterness on the back end. I had to check the label again to make sure it said 8% as there is no hint of it being a high abv. Mouthfeel is fluffy like a morning OJ with medium in carbonation and body. Reminds me of OJ and sprite I had as a child but better tasting and with an alcoholic kick.   Impressive is probably putting this beer lightly. This beer is superb.",0.6446479009524276,4.75,0.9672
Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,"I’ve sought this for awhile, really excited to finally try it. Gorgeous orange color with a light tan head, this is not hazy at all. Dank citrus notes dominate the nose, and there’s also a healthy pine note.  The taste has a nice boozy note up front. I don’t normally appreciate booze, but this works magnificently with the dank citrus notes and pine notes.   There’s a reason this is a world-class beer. Truly phenomenal, and well worth the wait.",0.6489090756363467,4.5,0.9672
Coconut B-Bomb,"Poured a dark brown with slight head. Smell is giant coconut with bourbon, cocoa, molasses, charred wood, leather, maple, and caramel, very decadent, powerful, and complex. Taste is huge coconut, but not to the point of overwhelming the nuanced flavors, barrel really comes through well with the supporting notes as well. Might be the most drinkable strong ale I have had. A decadent coconut dessert ale. Need to try the original!",0.6737234399916151,4.5,0.9672
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"All the hype is well deserved - one of my favorite and most complicated beers to date. This imperial stout was truly the thickest beer I've ever had and was certainly one of the most favorful. The most surprising characteristic was its smoothness in all of its boldness. It's unfortunate they will not bottle this one but then again, that's what's so great about it.   Loved it.",0.5988607035632846,4.5,0.967
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"2014 release. Poured a thick, thick, thick stream. Little head with small pour, but carb is there. The nose is beautiful blend of coffee and maple, with slight bourbon, absolutely stunning. The taste is transcendental, follows the nose perfectly. Never anything ever come close to this in term of actually tasting the smell. This beer has the most incredible mouthfeel of any beer I've ever had, that's including Lawson's Maple Tripple which brewed entirely on maple syrup and Tree House Good Morning which absolutely killed it with the mouthfeel.   This is my favorite beer of all time. I was really hoping for this beer to be a bust because how difficult it is to obtain. Loving it means I have to try to get more. Damn it!",0.6430765993067368,5.0,0.967
Enjoy By IPA,"4.20.16 good date choice guys. its a little sweeter, not quite as dank or funky this time, but really nice. did the abv go up a hair maybe? either way this is always excellent and deserves all the praise it gets. big ups to stone's marketing team or whoever came up with the title and concept. what a good idea.",0.5566457922943431,4.5,0.967
Fort Point Pale Ale,"A 16 oz can dated 3-15-17 poured into a TH tulip  Appearance- A very cloudy hazy orange with thin finger of white head. A dull sort of look  Smell- Melons with tropical fruits. I smell pineapple, grapefruit, and a nice hint of peach. Lite hops and even less piney resin.   Taste- A citrus and melon taste dominates the first sip. Not much hop in the taste but there is slight bitterness that grabbed my attention. The fruity taste lingers with a palate clinging sweetness.   Mouthfeel- Medium carbonation with a soft pleasing creamy texture. Rather oily for the finish and I have not had another APA that it really compares with.  Overall- The creamy texture sets this apart from most APAs. I have recently been enjoying Zombie Dust and this is a huge change in the feel and fruitiness. Great job Trillium.",0.6813841191727122,4.5,0.967
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Pours black, no head at all. Sticky lacing is present. Overall, looks good.  Smell: Big coffee notes, sweet maple, vanilla, fudge Taste follows the same, but it is even bolder Mouthfeel: Oily and sticky all at once but not necessarily creamy. IF there is a flaw in this beer, it is here. KBS, BCBS pre ABI days, and some of the other heavy hitters are simply more pleasing to the mouth to actually drink.  Overall, this is a very good beer. I would even lean to say a great beer, but my personal preference, the syrupy style of RIS is just not what I am looking for.",0.6601023428208584,4.5,0.967
Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,"I received a bottle of Hop Juju in a ninja box from the Newbies! I've been looking for this one for a while, so my heart skipped around a bit when I opened the box. I always love trying new IPAs - but ones that are so highly rated, and for so long... well now.  Hop Juju has some curious esters to it - a bit of banana, perhaps? It's quite hoppy, but I can't exactly nail down the style. The consistency and syrupy-ness tend to make me think this is a bit more in step with West Coast style IPAs, but it's very difficult to categorize. It has a sweetness, but likewise a bitterness. It's very palatable and nicely balanced.  This was worth a hunt, and a wait. It's quite good.",0.6394776628190678,4.25,0.967
Beatification,"A clear pale yellow, pouring into the glass you can tell this thing is nose and tongue stingly tart. Tastes bright citrus- grapefruit and lemon with crisp clean acidity. Tastes like the sour candies of your childhood. So complex and tart and the body on it is great. Just enough to hold up the acidity. Right up there with the most sour beers I’ve ever had and definitely one of the best I’ve had.",0.6981828884679485,4.75,0.967
Scaled Up,A nice brew. A very cloudy pale color. After pouring it in a glass i was expecting a wheat or flavor infused brew but I was pleasantly surprised buy the taste.

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2006 Vintage  A - pours a reddish orange color (more red than orange) without much of a head on it  S - smells beautiful - lots of raspberries with some citric tones with a layer of funk enveloping everything  T - huge citric tones up front that locks up the mouth. There is also a slight raspberry flavor present in the front as well. The more this one rolls back on the tongue the more the raspberries pop. The more this warmed, the stronger the raspberries were. On the backend I got surprise, surprise, more raspberries mixed with an acidic sourness. There is a slight bit of funk in the back too.  M - medium body, a little watery, with a carbonation burn at the back that leaves a dry finish  D - really solid framboise. Even with age on it the raspberries popped like crazy. I really enjoyed the added level of citric tones and subtle hints of funk thrown behind the raspberries. This makes we want to try the other Lou Pepes that much more.",0.6582426590921397,4.0,0.967
Black Tuesday,"From a 2013 bottle. (thanks to Ultrarunner100 for the share) This was a sublime experience. Black Tuesday pours as dark as the night, and at that you are captivated. The nose was full of amazing bourbon, chocolate and vanilla. The flavor includes all the nose and some anise and a nice warming booze for good measure. Feel is rich and full. I found this beer to be similar to some good ports I have had, and that is the way I recommend one approach it.",0.6384530965955301,4.5,0.967
Green,"Poured from a can aged six days. Cloudy orange color with white head. Tropical fruit smell. Tastes of mango, orange. Starts sweet and finishes with mild bitter. Great IPA, less sweet and more bitter taste than Julius, a great alternative. Great mouthfeel, good amount of carbonation. This is a great beer with typical tree house flavor.",0.6656068968071994,4.5,0.967
Sip Of Sunshine,"Can dated 10/5: The liquid rolled out of the can's opening as a clear, golden waterfall. A nice white foam rose with the beer level, ending at near a coupe of fingers in height. The fell to a nice mix of foam with some large soapy bubbles, mostly near the glass's edge. The body ended up a little hazy in the wide-bodied glass, though it was more clear looking straight down the glass when it was 2/3 gone.  The beer as a somewhat floral lean to it, in the sense that there's a nice fruit blossom-like aroma. A mix of sweeter light tropical fruits with a sharper citrus note that comes in behind it. A bit of spiced orange brings up the ending - though I can't tell if I'm getting some spicy hops or a little hint of the 8% ABV.  First sip is a bit of a surprise from what I expected given the nose. There is a brief malty sweet opening, but very quickly this beer is bitter from the tip of my tongue to the back of my palate. There's a nice malt platform for the hops, keeping the beer from being too much like hop water. The bitterness starts with a piney note (that the nose didn't reveal to me, unless it was what I sensed as ""spice""), and gains a little orange and ruby grapefruit. The bitterness softens to a pithy impression as the malt peaks through a little in mid-taste, bringing about a little tropical aspect that is familiar from the nose.  This beer has only a moderate heft to it, and is fairly clean overall. A decent tingle lasts from lips to gullet, partly from carbonation, but I feel the alcohol content is showing up a little as well. Aftertaste has a bit of a resinous to slightly dank taste and semi-dry.  Overall, I can see why this is very well liked by the community. I really liked its taste, and its feel reminded me a little of DC Brau's OTWOA. This beer is more bitter than that beer, however. It had a blend of citrus and pine/resin with just a brief interlude of a sweet/tropical flavor.",0.6899798293911796,4.5,0.9669
Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Poured into a Teku from a bottle purchased at the brewery two months ago.   A: Super pale, yellow straw color. Crystal clear, no haze at all until the final pour from the bottle. Sparkling carbonation, two fingers of frothy head. Laced the glass well on the way down.  S: Hay, lemon zest, funkiness, hints of spices, you can pick up hints of the underlying tartness T: Lemon hits the tongue first to start out tart, followed by funky brett type characteristics, some spices and barnyard type flavors M: Very light on the tongue, carbonation very present in the middle mouth but no bite. Finishes up super dry, bits of spice and tart linger on the tongue between sips O: Excellent take on the style, love the Saisons with some nice funk/tart to go wit the dryness and spice. Try if you can get some!",0.6343442332373829,4.5,0.9669
Vicinity,Look- Hazy golden straw. Slight tinge of translucency  Smell- Grape Juice that set out at room temp for a bit too long.A little bit wet earth. Nice funkiness to it  Taste- Similar to aroma. Digging it. Very hard to find a comparable. The after taste actually has a bit of the organic taste you get from eating green seedless grapes  Feel- Well rounded. Juicy beginning. Little bite but nice carbonation and spiciness  Overall- Great Beer. Not my favorite but I can appreciate the qualities that are not my preference. It's well crafted. Has a great taste to it. I can't downplay it.,0.6688750810711013,4.5,0.9669
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"On tap at Dark Lord Day 2009.  A: Very dark with a small tannish head.  S: Sweet malt with bourbon, oak, dark chocolate, coffee, and dark fruits.  T: Much the same as the nose, but with more of the oak presence coming through, especially as it warms.  M: Very heavy with low carbonation.  D: Excellent. The taste only gets better as it warms--one of the best sippers around.",0.6434922420403197,4.5,0.9669

Enjoy By IPA,Great IPA always fresh but never the same twice which is why it can be amazing or not really your style. Over all the good ones overtake the bad and for this I give it a 4.25 overall rating. Also trust the bottle and enjoy by the date on the front of the bottle.

Enjoy By IPA,"Enjoy by 10.31.18 -   22 oz. bottle:  Pours amber to copper with a creamy lasting white head. Lacing sticks.  The smell is robust - pine and grapefruit - some alcohol.  The taste is of pine/resin with grapefruit. A sweet touch with spicy alcohol comes through. Rounded bitterness in the finish. Alcohol shows but doesn't overwhelm.  It has a rich, full body with a silky smoothness despite alcohol bite.  Another winner from Stone! A big DIPA - big on hops and malt that interplay with each other well. Nice!",0.6789881224568767,4.25,0.9668
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Vintage 2008, poured from a corked and caged 750 into a tulip.  Pours a dark maroon color, almost brown when not in the light. Extreme soda like carbonation right after I opened it, but after about 5 minutes of drinking it seems almost flat. Very low levels of carbonation.   Aroma- Cherries, dark sweet fruit, must, vinegar, lemon peel, and tannins.  Taste- Starts with sweet cherries and must, and become sour and vinegary in the middle of the taste, and end very tannic and oaky, almost red wine like.   Nice mouthfeel with little carbonation and actually a little less crisp and dry than I expected.  Overall a great kriek, but at the $40 price point I may not buy it again.",0.6657085162501012,4.25,0.9668
Scaled Up,"A draft straight from the brewery in Canton.   A hazy orangish to golden color with about two fingers of head. Not much lacing for so much head.   You can smell all the tropical fruits from a distance. Orange, grapefruit, and a little lemon.   The taste does have fruity tones but it fades to something more bitter. The alcohol is well hidden in the fruits.   A dry sort of taste with a medium-heavy body. Very smooth.   Overall a solid DIPA with great fruits for an awesome taste and better smell.    kculrich, Wednesday at 04:25 PM Report Like",0.6765084636779807,4.5,0.9668
Scaled Up,"Pours a completely opaque orange color. Thinnish white head dissipates leaving sticky white lacing and some spotty foam on top of the beer.   Smell has notes of orange, cantaloupe, and a ton of dank mosaic hops. One of the purest dank smelling beers I've had. Tons of weed with a citrus undertone. I'm not a huge fan of overly dank smelling beers, but the aromas on this are quite pungent and crisp.   Taste is very fruity initially with lots of peach, mango, and orange. Gives way to a more dank flavor showcasing the mosaic hops. The finish then is almost spicy and the nelson hoops provide a white wine like flavor. Touch of hoppy bitterness on the finish. Really nice array of flavors that plays together quite well.   Feel is incredibly smooth with a thick mouthfeel. Medium carbonation, just a really nice DIPA. So drinkable and it hides the ABV incredibly well.   Overall a lovely DIPA.",0.6868012826196758,4.25,0.9667
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"500ml bottle poured into snifter.  A: Smallish white khaki head that disappears quickly. Body is pure black with no light coming through.  S: Whiskey, leather, bakers chocolate, roasted almonds, coffee is there but very subtle.  T: Lots of chocolate, whiskey, leather, nice anise, light licorice, very nutty,   M: Full bodied nice creaminess a touch thin.  O: Huge amounts of bourbon give way to quite an enjoyable beer all around. The beer has a lot of chocolate and nuttiness. The bourbon adds a nice sharpness with the leather quality. The coffee is there and comes out quite nicely but more subtle as the beer warms.",0.6396580481142566,4.5,0.9667
Sang Noir,"750ML bottle picked up at a store closing for half off - which is where these bombers out to be price-wise, & I’d buy them much more often. 2014 bottling split with my wife.   The pour looks brown until held up to the sun & is instantly light-struck, rendering the beer undrinkable. And reddish. No sediment, which surprises me. Smells like a nice pinot with a sharp shot of cherries. Nice.   Sang Noir should be put in six pack cans. Hits the tongue with a tart zip, edged with balsamic vinegar & tart, tasty cherries. Acidic wine & fresh oak contribute before a low, rumbling lick of bourbon makes it’s presence known with authority. Too many bourbon-barrel “wilds” end up all wild, with the beasties devouring any hint of barrel, which is not the case here. Fuller mouthfeel that many wilds, & so easy to sip.  I’d wager this would be a hit with wine lovers, beach bums, bourbon sippers, & all manner of people who like tasty stuff - if it were reasonably priced. The balance of beer & barrel is excellent, as is the beer.",0.6296857888517325,4.0,0.9667
Black Tuesday,"2015 version poured into a snifter glass; color is rich and dark brown with no head. very nice lacing. smell is bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, alcohol, toffee, dark malt. overtime the alcohol smell fades, but its strong at first, which isn't surprising given the abv and the age. taste follows the nose here: bourbon, brown sugar, vanilla, molasses, malt, alcohol burn that fades to sweet. massively drinkable considering the abv, yet this is a slow and steady sipper that was shared over several hours. mouth was the biggest surprise; thinner than anticipated with very low carbonation.  a stellar take on the style, but also a beast of a beer. glad i got to try it and glad i have another in the cellar to age.",0.6433747853427317,4.75,0.9667
Black Tuesday,"I really wanted to like this. I’ve heard great things about the Bruery and decided to become a Society member to give them a try. This is supposed to be one of their best but sadly, like most of their beers, it’s just too sweet for my liking and very reminiscent of a dessert wine.

Beatification,"Yellow and orange appearance, looks darker than pte, almost appearance wise is more akin to a typical dipa moreso than a wild ale. Real good looking head, this is the best looking wild ale I may have ever seen, just pristine.  Really massive sour notes, dry, earthy and extremely citrusy (and not just lemon).   Taste, wow, immediately reminds me why this is my favorite of the Russian -tion beers. And then it makes me pontificate whether I like this more than framboise for a cure or pty. Yup, that good. Body is light, taste, sour power is heavy. Keeps the brett aspect down, lets the other germs dominate. Never approaches anything that could be considered vinegar-esque. Oak notes are mild. Its all about orange type citrus notes, dry and earthy hyper drive sour.",0.6796878893250744,5.0,0.9667

Madagascar,"Stark black with a vibrant mocha foam that fizzles out to a thin ring.  Smell is waxy, bourbon soaked wood, roasted walnut, vanilla-sugared strawberry, and sharp, stinging cola, with a hint of maple emerging as it warms.  Vanilla drenched brownie flavor comes out up front, but is quickly cut by peppery and sharp bourbon that, when paired with the sweetness, translates to a very distinct Vanilla Coke flavor, with a maply finish.  Feel is thin and crisply carbonated with a sticky, semi-dry finish.  Okay, this really does taste like Vanilla Coke. I should know, I spent my entire high school job drinking them left and right. I thought maybe letting it warm would improve it, but ultimately it's way too sweet.",0.6728768772545914,3.75,0.9666
Black Tuesday,"d a 2013 bottle. Shared with friends.  A- pours pitch black with little head that fades, no lacing.  S- At first open and pour there were faint chocolate notes giving way to dark fruits and booze as it warmed.  T- Served slightly chilled, dark fruits and slight chocolate notes. As warms dark fruit and booze start to come out becoming very prevalent.   M- very thick, fills the pallet and goes down smooth.  O- this was well worth the KBS I traded for it. This easily goes up with the best barrel aged stouts easily available each year.",0.6105055216028005,4.75,0.9666
Haze,"L: Very orange in color with a white frothy head that stays around for a while. S: Orange with a little peach and other citrus. T: Similar to the nose, though not quite as juicy as the smell and a little less sweetness than some of the other TH beers. You can't really taste the bitterness, and this hides an 8% ABV better than any beer I've ever had this strong. Delicious. F: Some carbonation, not as hefty as some other NE IPAs. But nice.  O: Great beer, up there with all their others. The slight decrease in sweetness was actually a positive for my palate the night I drank it.",0.6402291502084122,4.75,0.9666
Swish,"I tried this one tonight for the first time and I was psyched based on all the glowing reviews. In fact I thought I was going to drink a beer that would knock me on my ass. What I had was a very solid DIPA that looked, smelled, and tasted great. It's not too far behind, but I don't think this beer quite stands up to the elite beers coming out of the Northeast right now.  Edit 3/19/15: yeah same result. Really very good beer but not the monster everyone's raving about IMHO. Smells great, tastes almost as good, but I just don't think it differentiates itself enough from many other New England IPAs",0.5450837128184379,4.25,0.9666
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Bought a cup of this for $5 at Dark Lord Day. Definitely worth it.  It has all the great characteristics of the regular Dark Lord (great mouthfeel, incredible malts, you know...), but the oak aging mellowed the super-sticky sweetness which was my least favorite thing about regular DL. It's great what the aging did for this beer.  I generally say that aging isn't worth the expense, but in this case it mellows the beer and further adds to the great complexity.",0.6317387672827767,5.0,0.9665
Black Tuesday,"2014 bottle poured into snifter (19.7% ABV). Pours jet black with small amount of head with strong bourbon, chocolate, and coffee aromas. These flavors definitely come through upon first taste with a little vanilla included. The carbonation level isn't too high. With the high ABV, one would think this would feel syrupy but it actually wasn't. Overall, this is a delicious beer and definitely lived up to the hype that surrounds it. I recommend this beer to anyone! Cheers!",0.6320653081947307,4.5,0.9665
Coolship Red,"Chill haze pale salmon-red with loud fizzy bubbles settling quickly to nothing but a slippery, lightly bubbling surface.  Smell comes across as oaky, acetic and vinegary, but also floral and fruity with tons of red raspberry.  Taste is quite sharply sour, very very potent of malic acidity, verging into acetic, but also full of bursting raspberry juice, as well as some toasty char and a little balsamic lemon glaze.  Nicely effervescent, satisfyingly so like champagne, but that quickly dissipates to a slick medium body with a stinging, semi-dry swallow. It gets far more acidic and sour as it warms, to its detriment.",0.6660705562914193,4.0,0.9665
Nectarine Premiere,Golden orange. Looks like orange juice. White head.  Nose is amazing. Straight nectarine.   Taste is nectarine and sourness. Tart with some lemon citrus. Extremely fruity.  Great sour beer. Loved the nose. Awesome offering.,0.6464807907422131,4.5,0.9665
Aaron,"re really excited to get to try this one.  L: very dark, looked almost like prune juice with just a ring of bubbles around the glass  S: The smell was sort of faint with the barrel dominating but hinted at dark fruits and sugars  T: Very big. The initial hit is huge, bright dark fruit: plum, prunes, raisins, followed by bourbon and oak. Definitely not as much bourbon as a lot of BA barleywines, and that worked well. It complimented the beer instead of overtaking it.  F: Full bodied and just shy of sticky, although it does leave a coating on your lips and tongue.  O: This is just a really nice beer. I'm glad we've got another one in the cellar.",0.6043658093055866,4.75,0.9665
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Enjoyed at the Alvinne Craft Beer Festival In Belgium. Reviewed from notes.   Brilliant cherry red body. no head or carbonation.   Smells a bit of malt but mainly of really fresh cherries.   Tastes of concentrated fresh cherry juice, with some wood and some bitterness from the cherry pits.   Body is light and with no carbonation, it has a flat mouthfeel. But the mouth just bursts delightfully with fresh cherry flavor.  Great tasting cherry lambic.",0.6717640359586874,4.5,0.9664
Sang Noir,"Bottle form Rutager, 750ml into a tulip.   Deep blood red, light tan head with good lace and nice retention. Nose is bourbon cherry pie, sharp acidity, oak and cherry pits. Harsh acidity, but the bourbon smooths things out. Taste has light bourbon, oak, an intense sour cherry blast, tart, acidic, and more cherry pits. Finishes sweetish, but tartness prevails. Rich, intense cherry character, and a lovely malt profile. Medium full feel, lasting finish. Awesome.",0.6821404298900691,4.5,0.9664
Beatification,"Tried right after a 4 year old bottle of 3F Gueuze. Bar was set high...but met! Great fizzy, pale, gueuze-like appearance. But this one ended up more funky and interesting than the 3F. Loved the aroma and flavor of this - perfectly tart, funky, earthy, fruity, tannic and bitter. An amazing beer.",0.6685364454088786,4.75,0.9664
Scaled Up,"Consumed 1/29/16  Cheers to Goblinmunkey7 for sharing this beer  A: Medium tangerine in color with some honey and gold around the edges - decidedly hazy and straight-up turbid - pours with a medium sized, white head, fades to a wispy cap, leaves some streaks of lacing  S: Stupid, stupid amounts of hops - first off, this is stupidly dank - extremely resinous and extremely dank, straight-up weed - some bright citrus with sharp orange and grapefruit - yes, this is a juice bomb, with lots of tropical aromas - pineapple, mango, and melon - some pine and hits of mint as well - some pale malts underneath the weedy, resinous juice explosion  T: About as absurd as it smells - an atomic hop bomb, a true Trillium IPA - super, super juicy with orange, tangerine, and grapefruit juice - some floral citrus as well and a touch of pith - resinous and sticky pine, hop cones, and weed - tropical notes, including sticky pineapple, mango, melon, and a touch of passion fruit - so, so juicy - some herbal notes and mint - pale malts, but they don't matter  M: Medium body, chewy (or ""fuzzy,"" as some describe New England IPAs), medium carbonation, lingering hoppy finish  O: The fact that this is basically an experiment is what makes this hilarious  As anyone in the Boston area knows, Trillium is awesome. This DIPA is no exception. I had some of this about a month ago (which I believe was batch 1), and it was good. This is even better. And by that, I mean it's absurd.",0.6579274614080743,4.5,0.9664
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"e number 240 of 300, purchased at the release.  Normally, I would start with the appearance, but as soon as I popped the cap, I was flooded with coffee aroma. I have never smelled coffee so intense in a beer. It pours out so dark and thick -- two more extremes I have never seen the likes of.  The smell? Coffee, toffee, chocolate, all manner of dark fruit. As it warms, maple begins to emerge, then eventually dominate. It delivers all of this and more as I drink it. It's a sipper, to be sure, but it is one of the most enjoyable beers I have ever tasted.  Mouthfeel is great. It's full and creamy, with restrained carbonation. If this beer has a flaw, I suppose it's a tad sweet. But I will dream about this one for a long time.",0.6528200926558675,5.0,0.9664
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Found a 2008 bottle at a local bar. Score!  A: Pours a dense pink/ruby color with a beastly pale pink head. Great retention and lacing. Looks amazing.  S: Rich raspberry aroma with a touch of cranberry and a dry hay-like smell. As it warms, the wood begins to come out a bit and I get some cedar.   T: Nice snap of unripe raspberry/cranberry tartness. Lemon, some faint oak and a nice dryness on the finish with some cherry skin. Absolutely fantastic.",0.6592543387646902,4.5,0.9664
Swish,YES!!!! The nose on this beer - so wonderful - so malty sweet and then boom excellent hop bitterness. Notes of huge pineapple and earth and dankness. Huge huge huge fan of this one. The look of this beer is quite yellow/strawy/hazy not my favorite look but everything else is pretty much perfect.,0.6286902613180572,4.75,0.9663
Todd The Axe Man,"Clear golden orange with a nice white head that leaves excellent lacing.  Citrus, stone fruit, mostly peach and faint pine. Malt is there but sit way in the back.  Taste is strong hoppy goodness consisting of peach, nectarine skin, citrus and faint pine. Finished dry and bitter.  Mouthfeel is spot on for the style. Medium and almost coating. Carbonation is well done and helps this finish on the soft side.  In your face old school ass kicker of beer. Really good and will enjoy as long as in is available in my area. Recommended if you want a change from the juice bombs.",0.6846605979632546,4.25,0.9663
Enjoy By IPA,"Pours a clear, orange color with a little over a finger of white head. The smell is fantastically strong from the moment the bottle is opened. Strong smells of tropical fruits, especially citrus like tangerines and oranges, some smell of peaches. Dank. Smells delicious. Taste is solid, hoppy bitterness from the start, not overpowering but it's there. Sweet and citrus, some pine notes, alternates a lot with the malts. Nice, medium body beer. Has a lingering bitterness to it. Overall its solid and nice, glad I grabbed a six pack, might get another one.",0.680247782449856,4.25,0.9663
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"I had this on-tap at the 3 Floyds brewpub during Dark Lord Day.  Appearance: Pours a pitch black color with no light coming through. There is hardly any head.  Smell: The smell is very sweet and roasty with bourbon hitting the nose right away. I'm also picking up some chocolate and vanilla notes.  Taste: This is an awesome tasting beer. Very sweet and roasty with some bourbon heat. I'm picking up hints of cocoa and vanilla. Very smooth.  Mouthfeel: Very thick and mouth coating. The carbonation is mild and the finish is dry.  Overall: I liked the vanilla version a little bit better, but I really enjoyed this one as well. The balance is wonderful and it is a smooth drinker.",0.6637059318812517,5.0,0.9663
Thicket,"Pours thick and opaque with a high effervescence and no head. It is a rich purple and looks like homemade blackberry jam. Smell is like other Side Project fruited sours: large amounts of fresh ripe fruit (in this case, blackberries) and a lacto yogurty sourness. In this case, the fruit shine over the lacto. Taste is extremely sour but not as sour as Fencerow or Fuzzy. Tastes like unsweetened yogurt with fresh tart blackberries. A defined sour acidity lingers on the aftertaste with a hint of red wine tannins. Mouthfeel is well carbed and very dry. Overall, a fantastic beer that balances the fruit and sourness better than every other SP fruited sour other than Blanc.",0.6717798313175515,4.5,0.9663
Green,"Drank along with Julius for comparison. This was more golden with slight haze, adequate head with good lacing and retention. Sharp on the nose with more earthy notes and hints of herb and pine. I really like galaxy hops and was excited about this, but I didn’t care for it. I thought there was very little citrus or funk here. It was dry, herby, and mineral with significant bitterness. On the other hand, it got better as I drank and I appreciated the full bodied complexity. Can’t say I would seek it again though. If you are expecting a NEIPA, you might be thrown off.",0.6898981947531113,4.0,0.9663
Vicinity,"Poured from a chilled can into a tulip glass. Not sure how old the beer was, I received it as a gift a week earlier and I don't know how long ago Trillium had it available.  L: Massachusetts/New England IPA... orangish (though a dark orange, not as bright as some of those from Tree House), cloudy with some translucence, it seemed like I could see 1/8 inch or so into the murky depths. Poured thicker than most IPAs, but this seems to be the NE IPA trend S: citrusy, fruity, summer fruits... combination of orange, mango, nectarine sort of. There was a sweetness like cream with an underlying spicy note we couldn't place. T: The sweet, fruit forward hop aromas were prevalent in the immediate flavors, but they were quickly balanced by a slight spicy and herbal qualities from other hops. The malt bill also contributed to an earthy and mineral-like quality. We found it balanced, and complex.  F: it was thick, but not like nectar. It coats the mouth and lingers. Carbonation was spot on. O: This beer was made in honor of an oyster bar's 1 yr anniversary. I can see how the fruity, mineral quality in the beer would pair nicely with oysters. The beer was fine by itself, but would really shine in that context.",0.6797053504136142,4.5,0.9662
Darkstar November,Wow! Having at a share right after I had Damon from Hill Farmstead and I think I like this better. Very marshmallows mouthfeel. Pours so dark with a great head. Delicious!,0.5770335335460325,5.0,0.9662
Darkstar November,"2015 500ml mini-bomber into a Duvel tulip at fridge temp, allowed to warm.  Look: pours like straight used motor oil. Essentially no head, even in the face of an increasingly vigorous pour.  Smell: smoke, chocolate, cherry/berries.  Taste: dark angry roast, some bright pine/cherry from the hops, oak, caramel, hints of vanilla/coconut/molasses.  Feel: very thick and chewy, but without being tedious. Carbonation gives it a bit of fluffiness, and it hits a perfect balance between dry and juicy. Standard-setting.  Overall: this is a pretty brash beer, and there's a bit of harshness in the taste that keeps it from being a world-beater. But it's a very good beer nonetheless; glad I got to try.",0.6738132015645023,4.25,0.9661
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"rb  12oz gold wax provided by Syndicate in a homerun tasting... Darrel is good peeps and should be given the utmost trader elbow room IMO.  Pours impossibly thick.. dark brown/black viscous brew.. the the head is dark brown and dies back quick but the sugars hold on leaving nice lacing.  Thick nose.. sweet and never over done... tons of character.. maple with big coffee and dark toast.  Flavor is again just amazingly full.. from front to back the dark malt moves silky into the bourbon and dark cherry... soooo thick and full.  Very tasty, but not worth the hype... Not even close.  Darrel deserves a nice slow.. golf clap for acquiring this one.. clap clap clap.  Thanks my friend.  4.25/4.25/4./4.5/4.25",0.6172878431763712,4.25,0.9661
Vicinity,"Canned date of 07/12/16  Appearance - Pours hazy and pale orange in color with a white, finger width head that doesn't hold for long before fading to a thin, broken layer of surface suds. Not much for lacing.  Smell - Slightly juicy aroma. Mild mango and lesser citrus.   Taste - Follows the nose. Not much punch, but juicy with mango notes, lesser citrus, some mild pineapple zing, and a hint of pine and pith in the finish. Malts are beneath, but hit on some doughy bread character. Finish is lightly bright citrus and some fair white grape character.  Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth, and quite drinkable.   Overall - A pretty good NE DIPA. I don't know. Maybe the Yojo has spoiled me, but I didn't find this particuarly amazing.",0.6940527564584829,4.0,0.9661

Mocha head quickly thins to a rim. Wonderful lacing from side to side.  Oh that musty, Bells barrel fragrance. Nice bourbon high, dark chocolate, molasses and vanilla.  Roasty char, dark chocolate, bourbon predominate with some nice vanilla and molasses finish.   Thick, fudge, tongue-coating goodness.  A wonderful, decadent, thick and rich BA RIS.

Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Pour from a bottle that was corked on April 28, 2010, into a goblet.  Deep crimson with cherrywood undertones. Murky. The head, pink and girlish, flits away teasingly.  Schaerbeekse kriek smells like the inside of a winery, full of fermenting fruit and freshly-emptied oak barrels. It’s also funkier than George Clinton, with heavy helpings of hay, horses and lemongrass. Cherry syrup is there, but in a more subdued form than I would’ve liked.  The flavor moves the barnyard funk to the background, but replaces it with a burly balsamic acidity holds hard to the sides of the tongue. Tart and sweet, with smacks of underripe cherries that become more prominent as I work my way through the glass. Lemon peel, vanilla and new oak stand out against a backdrop of red wine.  Champagne-like in carbonation, the beer’s highly effervescent, which only accentuates the feathery medium-light body.  There’s no denying Schaerbeekse Kriek is a quality example of the style — a true lambic, with the accompanying tartness and funk — but I wish there was a touch less sour stuff and more sweetness. It gets a little too abrasive near the end of the glass, and I find myself wishing for more cherry.",0.6506831849731167,4.0,0.966
Chocolate Rain,"Well lookie, they aged Black Tuesday with cacao and vanilla! What a great idea. This totally improves Black Tuesday in every way. The vanilla is very natural tasting, and the chocolate plays well. If I ran The Bruery I would find a way to make this a regular...at an astounding price. If only they could find a way to can it. Love that April Fools joke.",0.5408149624707428,4.75,0.966
Madagascar,"Batch 2 bomber poured into a BCBS snifter.  A: Pours a rich black color with over a finger of khaki head that reduces slowly and leaves a thin collar. Lacing is minimal. Viscosity seems right no par at just below 10%.  S: I get vanilla up front as the most dominant. Bourbon next, with just a slight bit of coffee. The chocolate gets lost in the mix. I'm a huge vanilla anything fan, so I really enjoy the aroma of this beer.  T: Vanilla up front which drives a very sweet flavor, with the bourbon coming in right at the end to leave a semi sweet and semi dry after flavor. Again, coffee and chocolate are more afterthoughts. As the glass warms I pick up a bit more chocolate notes, but not it is still a complementary flavor to the vanilla.  M: So creamy. Carbs is low, which lends to just how creamy this beer is. Slightly dry on the end, attributed to bourbon. Yet enough sweetness that the dryness is very mellow.   O: Granted not a lot of Milk Stouts are barrel aged, this is easily the best Milk Stout I've had to date. The vanilla and bourbon additions are very welcomed, I only wish that the coffee made it through more - a possible sign of not having fresh. I love this beer, and love even more that a fairly unknown brewery can nail a style like that and redefine what a Milk Stout can be.",0.6511389429339836,4.5,0.966
Flora - Blueberry,"Pour is a transparent blood purple with a pink head. Nose is a really nice blueberry cake aroma, nice faint grain and a decent yeast, faint vanilla and some fair oak, leathery brett towards the back. Taste is very nice, lots of bright blueberries, a bit of yeast, notes of oak, brett is just a hint strong in the back thinning out the great flavors a small amount with a bitter finish. Body is bigger, a bit prickly in the back, strong carb.",0.674549827120746,4.75,0.966

Swish,"This beer pours a super cloudy golden yellow color with a 2 finger bright white head that fades to 1/4 inch ring around the edge with a microfilm layer across the top. There are sticky chunks of hanging lacing. Smell is citrus, tropical and green dankness. Grapefruit, orange, pithy citrus, mango, pineapple and dankness burst out of the glass. Taste is the same, simply fantastic. Feel is light and juicy, but has a sticky resinous finish. Cannot believe this is 8%. Overall this beer is amazing. Like more resinous, citrus, and slightly more dank version of Alter Ego. Just fantastic. Also has a similar hop profile to Billy Full Stack in my opinion.",0.6552293056096584,4.75,0.9659

Green,"This is a bit more piny and less citrusy than its sibling Julius. Sweet pine up front, quickly transitions into tropic fruit, primarily mango, and a sweet maltiness. Medium body and a tropical fruit/citrus aftertaste with some pine resin. Really pleased with this one.

Coconut B-Bomb,Black in color. Tan colored head that receeds into a nice collar. The aroma is exactly like a firestone 19th anniversary. The mouthfeel is creamy and exciting. Coconut is very noticeable in this beer. It honestly taste like special K cereal with coconut slices. This beer has a candy like sweetness to the finish.

Vicinity,"Great, awesome pineapple/OJ color with a glorious head of 2 fingers in my Deschutes pilsner glass.   Aromas of tropical mango, pineapple, orange, grapefruit, and hop resins.   Heavy quantities of orange, grapefruit, pineapple, stone fruit, but met with a rather firm and overwhelming spiciness and peppery flavor, meeting pine-cone bitterness. Peppery, herbal finish. I could have done with more juiciness, and less pepper overall here.  Feel is very creamy and sparkling water-like carbonation. A resin-y finish.   Overall, a pretty good DIPA. Definitely worth a shot if you can grab it.",0.6809861276890634,4.0,0.9657
Coconut B-Bomb,"This was a surprise for me. I always expect BW, but then realize it is a very dark winter warmer. This takes b-bomb to another level. I like it more than CC-bomb as well.

Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Purchased in Belgium from Bier Tempel in Brussels.  750ml corked and caged green bottle uncorks with minimal effort with a loud socking thunk. Pours a dirty, muddled red-pink colour, with a frothing and fizzling head of rose that effervesces to nothing, like a glass of soda. Light body, very little to it. Apart from the colour, I'm not overly impressed.  Nose is organic and funky, with slightly acidic medicinal cherry overtones. Quite brightly flavoured, but also deeply husky and pongy, like a good lambic should be. Not bad.  Taste is clean, vinous and acidic, with pleasantly tart lambic sourness that cleaves its way through the palate. The kriek character merely tones the acidity—it doesn't add any sweetness of true fruit essence. Finish is lingering and slightly bitter with cherry pip and stalk characters. Crisp and biting feel, although the tingle comes exclusively from the acidity, not at all from the now dormant carbonation.  Not a bad kriek, and a pretty bright and unapologetically acidic one. It doesn't have a great deal of complexity, and the rampant acidity makes me consider it a little unbalanced, but it's a respectable beer nonetheless.",0.7017786994313828,3.5,0.9657
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"batch poured into a TG tulip.  Upon opening, maple just filled the room. Tons of maple.  Look is super viscous. Motor oil like. Opaque black. Coats the glass.  Taste is all maple up front and then finishes with a coffee flavor that I found to be a touch astringent. Faded as it warmed though.  Feel was super thick, viscous body. Coated my mouth and lingered.

Taste: opens with some pineapple, a little bit of mango, more fruitiness comes through with some peach, and lighter amounts of citrus. malts come through with some bread and lightly toasty malts. some additional tropical fruits near the end.  Mouthfeel: fairly full bodied, pretty refreshing. moderate to strong bitterness. some lingering bitterness.

Flora,"Bottle purchased for onsite consumption at Hill Farmstead Brewery in Greensboro Bend, VT. Batch 6, looks to have been bottled in 2014?  This one pours with a slightly hazed straw yellow color, with a bit of fluffy head and a little bit of lacing.  This smells like funky lemon candy, wheat, oak, earthy white wine, and dank citrus.  This is exceptional, especially at this advanced age (4+ years). It's got such a deep citrusy funk, wheaty and floral, with a great oakiness. It's so wild and untamed, but also delicate and soft.  This is pretty light bodied, but very creamy and unbelievably drinkable. If this wasn't so difficult to acquire, I'd drink it everyday.  This beer is impressive both in the depth of flavor and it's long term aging ability.",0.6999594278525192,4.75,0.9656
Darkstar November,Bottle  Pours as you would expect. Thick motor oil flows from the bottle. Very small mocha head that disappears quickly. Aroma is stupid good. Lots of milk chocolate bourbon and vanilla flavors. This one almost smells like there's vanilla beans in it. But all there bourbon barrel aged beers do. No wonder FO is so good. Taste is like a milk chocolate bourbon brownie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Tons of sweet chocolate marshmallow and of course that vanilla flavor from the barrels. Mouthfeel was med-full. Leaning more towards full. AWESOME brew. Bottle logic nailed it again!!,0.5948323891484872,4.75,0.9656
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"L — Pours a pitch black body with a scant half finger of light brown head. Minimal retention and lacing  S — Bourbon, prune, bittersweet chocolate, smoke, vanilla, caramel, oak. Comes across as a pure BA stout, not one with a bunch of adjuncts added.	 T — Rich fudge, cinnamon, vanilla, toffee, caramel, vanilla, bourbon, oak, chili heat, dried dark fruit, hint of tobacco leaf and leather. Everything is integrated so wonderfully. So decadent  F — Big mouthfeel, medium- carb. More thick and oily than velvety and fluffy, but that’s ok  O — This beer really knocked my socks off. As a lover of this style of flavored stout who frequently finds the chili heat to be too mild, this one really has that perfect level of spice. Pricey, but you get what you pay for   91/100",0.6485885728024778,4.25,0.9656
Sip Of Sunshine,"The appearance had a hazy glossy orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than thirty seconds leaving some light speckled to semi-spider web lacing. The smell had a full bittersweet citrus hops with a light underscore of piney hops, graced by a big sweet sticky freshly cut grass and as it opens up, the citrus opens up to lean towards the grapefruit. The taste balanced extremely nicely between the bitter citrus and piney hops to the sweet freshly cut grass. Sticky sweet grapefruit to grassy aftertaste leads to a wet citrus finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a great sessionability about it. I’d want to pound this on a hot Summer’s day. Overall, I say this was an exceptionally wonderful DIPA that I would love to have again.",0.695160008681648,4.25,0.9656
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"My sticky sin stained hands hold tight to a 10oz. plastic cup at Darklord day 2008. Used oil black with no head just a skim of dark tan ring on the edge of the cup. Nose is big and thick with tons of deep dark fruit notes and malty sweet port. Thick and really brooding, this is what blackness should taste like. The song ""Paint it black"" comes to mind. Incredible complexity from dark rich sweetness and smooth long dryness on the end of the tongue. Very port like as expected. This would challange Raspberry Eisbock for my favorite after dinner beer. An attractively brooding mouthfeel. Surprisingly drinkable for its strength.",0.6602501954825999,4.5,0.9656
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Dark color with tan lacing. The nose is all coffee in a beautifully smooth way. The taste I mainly coffee with some good bourbon depth to it, keeps it from being bitter. The finish is a little harsh compared to the taste, but still great. Overall body could be a little fuller/creamier. This is an awesome ba coffee stout, very glad to have it.",0.6822907325728947,4.5,0.9656
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Poured into a snifter. An opaque bark brown color with a thin dark tan head. Little retention and lacing. A big whiff of chocolate and vanilla on the first sniff. Some bourbon and roasted malt. The taste followed with sweet vanilla, chocolate, candied sugar, and whisky. A very thick, viscous drink. Well-balanced but heavy and sweet. Definitely a sipper with friends. Great brew.",0.6146022898768565,4.25,0.9655
Aaron,"A: Pour is a hazy red, brownish color with a frothy off-white head and faint retention  S: Nice touch of bourbon/barrel essence. Extreme complexity with the elegance of wood, nuts, toffee, vanilla, caramel, fruit, and oak surfacing  T: Sweet, sugary, caramel fruit with vanilla, subtle chocolate, and leathery presence; slightly bitter and a boozy counterpart. Nice touch of rich, syrupy bourbon to the likes of the aroma  M: Sticky, tacky, oily, creamy body with a bit of booze and medium carbonation  O: The intricacies truly show here; have fun and get encapsulated in this blockbuster",0.6806449970160559,4.5,0.9655
Swish,"finally drinking this for the first time. pours out a glowing pineapple juice color with bright white head that leaves excellent lacing.   on aroma and palate is massive amounts of orange, pithy grapefruit, peaches, hint of mango, some sharp herbaceous character, sweet bready malts and a hit of pine. at first it drinks a bit like a juice bomb but there is definitely balance that shows as the beer warms. mouthfeel is soft and medium bodied, easy drinking stuff. overall an excellent brew!",0.701020989878484,4.5,0.9654
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"I have had Dorothy before and think it’s wonderful.

Scaled Up,"Thanks to JLindros for hooking me up with a can. Like him I just haven't come across this beer somehow.  A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice hazy light gold hue with a one finger white head that fades slowly to leave a creamy blanket and light lacing.  S - Aromas of some musty tropical fruits, papaya, guava, light pineapple. Little bit of citrus peel and juice, decent amount of resinous earthy pine. No discernible alcohol.  T - Taste is similar to the nose. Loads of musty and dank papaya and guava. Very little bitterness. The grapefruit and citrus notes are pleasant, mosaic pretty much dominated. Loads of spicy earthy pine. Nice malt backbone, little bit of biscuit notes.   M - Mouthfeel is quite nice. Almost brightly carbonated, medium bodied, alcohol hidden nicely. Not heavy. Solid.  O - Overall this was a solid DIPA. I feel the mosaic was a bit heavy handed here, for my taste anyways, as it seemed to clash with the musty tropical fruit notes. Still though this was a solid beer.  Serving Type: Can",0.6968393568737175,4.0,0.9654
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"2015 vintage drank in a snifter on 2/11/2017  Overall this has the look and feel of the great J O's barrel aged stouts. This one certainly has faded some, and I would love to try this fresh. The chocolate and barrel came through nicely, however, there was only a little bit of the sweetness from the maple. Certainly a great beer, but probably one that shouldn't age for 2 years. I did read that this vintage had some infection reviews, so I was excited to had a good bottle.",0.5887739018904439,4.25,0.9654
Swish,"Poured from a 16oz can into a snifter. Thank you Joel for trading this to me! About 2 weeks old.  Pours a very hazy bright orange body with a decent one finger white head that reduces fairly quickly to leave a little lacing and a layer of foam.   Aromas are juicy and potent - very tropical, fruity, citrusy, mango and pineapple, very inviting. Definitely an East Coaster.  The tongue matches the nose but to a lesser extent - still very tasty though, with tons of citrus, grapefruit, tropical fruits, followed by a slight lingering bitterness. Medium carb and pretty creamy / medium body.   The hype is true, this beer is truly world class. Like a glass full of fresh, fruity hops.",0.6846524359213051,4.5,0.9653
Todd The Axe Man,"to see that others have found this unfiltered now! Floaties are present and it threw me off with the picture on the Surly website.  Have had this on draft a few years back and now glad to see it in cans. Even though price point is on the high end for a 4pack of 16oz cans, it still works out compared to buying equivalent bombers.  Look is golden haze unfiltered, looks juicy and the head quickly dissipates. Excellent lacing.  Smell is dank and more fruit forward, tropical, mango, peach, melon. Hint of malt and like the fact that it is a single type malt ipa.  Feel juicy, juicy, juicy and dry. Still feeling the tongue tingle a good minute after a sip. Look of an NEIPA but the bitterness lingers.   Overall an awesome beer worthy of the ratings across the Interweb on this site and the others. Get this fresh and you will not be disappointed.",0.6490653646946818,4.5,0.9653
Black Tuesday,"2013 vintage  Appearance: Pours dark and thick, as an Imperial Stout should, with a small khaki head that collars quickly. Lots of alcohol legs, as expected.  Smell: Vanilla, Caramel, Coconut, maple syrup, Bourbon, tannins from the barrel, dark fruit, fairly strong scent of alcohol(shocker).  Taste: Amazing blend of caramel, vanilla and dark fruit up front with a bit of a Bourbon bite in the middle. The end is sweet malt with some roasty character. Though there is a bit of heat at the end as expected, I wouldn't have guessed the high abv; this definitely drinks smoother than how much booze it contains. It sure does warm you up going down, however, which is where you can tell how strong it is.  Mouthfeel: Viscous, silky and smooth. Can't see how this could improve.  Overall: Drinks very smooth for the abv and has an amazing combo of flavors, blended extremely well. I'd love to try some older vintages, but I don't see anything wrong with drinking this right now. Not a let down at all, must age amazingly.",0.6996646407954145,4.75,0.9653
Society & Solitude #4,"on Tap in a Chimay goblet  A- A cloudy apricot, light orange with a thin head and nice lacing on the glass  S- Orange, grapefruit and citrus hops. A little sweetness almost like fresh strawberries. None of that barnyard hay/funk you get from other HF beers  T- A nice complex hop kick in the teeth. like a fresh sweet orange and nice balance of bitter and sweetness. Again none of that yeasty/grassy you get from the others.   M- Medium to mild. big flavor but not much carbonation   O- Another magnificent beer from HF. This beer reminds me of Lawson's 'Double Sunshine' big time.",0.6659311052785623,4.5,0.9653
Mastermind,"Pours a cloudy golden straw color with a 1-finger white head. Good retention on the head and leaves a nice crown of lace as it dissipates.   The aroma is very tropical, with notes of ripe mangoes, pineapple, and light melon. Back end has some wet grass and just a touch of pine.   The taste is a nice blend of tropical and citrus flavors, with loads of pineapple leading the way. The malt is equally as present, however, and provides a subtly sweet biscuit character.   The feel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Smooth, yet slightly sticky with a dry finish. Has a slight warmth from the alcohol.  Overall, a very good, very well-balanced beer. The tropical flavors and aromas are nice and the malt provides a perfectly sweet balance to the hops. However, if you're expecting a hop bomb, or something akin to Second Fiddle, you may want to pass on this one given the difficulty it takes to obtain.",0.7231999373449329,4.25,0.9652
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Opened this baby to celebrate my 28th birthday and my engagement to my beautiful girlfriend. One of the oldest gueuzes I’ve had to date, really been looking forward to popping this. This is a red label '02 poured into a Cantillon gueuze tumbler.  A-Pours a murky orangish brown in color with a half fingers worth of tight white head.   S-The nose is straight dirty funk. There is lemon, dirt, manure, wet dog, horse blanket, and must.   T-The flavor mirrors the nose, there is a bunch of lemon rind and must.  M-Light mouthfeel, almost a little watery, light carbonation, gentle acidity, and a long finish.   O-Had this side by side with Armand & Tommy and I thought it blew Armand & Tommy out of the water. The funk has taken a nice, big hold of this and isn’t letting go. Armand is a magician. One of the best gueuzes I've had to date, trailing only Loerik and Blauw in my opinion. I will actively be seeking more bottles of this.",0.5791844969029569,4.75,0.9652
Todd The Axe Man,"2 month old can poured into a snifter   L: Unfiltered with sediment throughout, burnt orange/amber with loose white head that quickly fades S: Straight from the fridge it's pretty two dimensional: dank resiny hops and malt. As it warms, I get more sweet fruits--mango, guava, apricot--and it's fantastic. T: Very well balanced with the malt sweetness balanced by grapefruit and resin hop bitterness. After warming in the glass, those sweet fruits came out more. There is a very long lasting mild bitter aftertaste. F: Slicker and boozier than I'd guess for the style and ABV, but not unwelcome. Mild to medium carbonation. O: This drinks more like a DIPA with just a bit less sweetness and a bit lighter/more carbonated. Very nice, though, especially after it hit 50°/55°.",0.6735491719393886,4.25,0.9652

There is also some spiciness with it and wheat aromas. There is a slight bit of bubblegum as well.   Taste: It has a strong banana flavor with wheat a bit of spiciness to it. It has a sweet impression. As it warms, there is a it of clove that can be tasted. There is a slight hint of vanilla.   Feel: It has a moderately light body. It is somewhat creamy.

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2001 vintage, bottled in 2002. Huge thanks to alfrantzell for breaking this awesome S.O.B. out on his birthday.  Pours a cloudy reddish color with a nice off-white head that fades to a ring and spotty foam.  Aroma is very funky and tart, with a lot of raspberry and just a tiny bit of acetone/nail polish.  Flavor really jumps out at you with a huge fruit flavor. Raspberry all the way, really tart and funky, with a little nail polish, but not at all in a bad way. Really amazing taste.  Medium body with lots of long-lasting acidity. Carbonation is fairly lively despite the age on this one.  Great drinkability. Kept me wanting more of it. This is a hell of a fruit lambic, easily one of the best I've ever had.",0.6500637148294419,4.5,0.9652

Haze,"Pours a beautiful hazey golden/yellowish color. Looks like peach juice. Aroma fills the room with notes of peach, orange and passion fruit. The taste follows with peach and orange up front and an oniony dankness on the back end. Beautiful creamy mouthfeel. Dankness lingers a bit longer than expected and stays with an aftertaste I can do without. Leaves beautiful lacing all over the glass. Really nice beer overall.",0.6522752156572833,4.75,0.9652
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,Another winner from Trillium. The street series is excellent and this is one of the better brews from that series. Like most Trillium brews its very well balanced and super smooth. Well done,0.6389677637371322,4.5,0.9652
Chocolate Rain,2014 bottle poured into snifter. Chocolate brown in appearance. Was expecting black motor oil I guess. Huge bourbon barrel characteristics with some some slight chocolate on the nose. Medium mouthfeel with more bourbon and some sweetness in the taste and aftertaste which helps cut the alcohol content. Not an overwhelming 18.5% abv at all and believe the cacao nibs and subtle sweetness help. Very little vanilla present if at all. Outstanding brew. Hoping I can move from PS to RS to stock up even more. Curious to see how this would taste with a bit of age on it.,0.6471800120101294,3.75,0.9652
Beatification,"Batch 5  A - Pours a clear yellowish orange, with a small head that quickly dissipates. Minimal lacing, but some visible carbonation in the glass.  S - Crisp and slightly tart with a funk. Hint of lemon zest and a sliced green apple.  T - This beer packs a very intense sour bite! There's a nice fruitiness (green apple in particular) too and a perceived sweetness though it's actually pretty dry.  M - the brew was medium in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a citrusy, slight fruity, acidic, sour, and dry finish.  O - Another great sour from Russian River. I prefer Supplication and Consecration over this one.",0.6938055992750711,4.0,0.9651
Chocolate Rain,"From notes on 6/27/15   Opened this bottle with 3 other people. Probably a good thing since it is so big. Pour a thick black body with pretty much no head. Huge sweet cocoa aroma. Almost overwhelming taste. Just a ton of cocoa and vanilla with lots of bourbon. It has a pretty strong bite on the tongue. You can tell there is a lot of alcohol. Still, I very much so enjoyed this beer.",0.6127514423513082,4.75,0.9651
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Here is another BA top 250 that is over hyped and does not belong on the list. I love hefeweisens and this one is very mediocre.   Look is hazy, cloudy, tea like with bubbly lacing.   Aroma is wheat, malt, and mild banana  Mouthfeel is thin, watery, creamy, and flat Taste is very subtle of bananas and wheat, can't grasp any clove. Overall there are better hefeweisens out there and was hoping for much stronger banana and clove flavor. When it all comes down to it I'd rather have a Hoegarden and was very much hoping this would be better. Sure in the year 1040 this may have been some amazing beverage but now in 2017 it's pretty plain. Perhaps there wouldn't be other hefeweisens without this but just doesn't cut it for what I want my hefeweisen to be.",0.6859647243336021,3.25,0.9651
Nelson,"Been wanting to try this for a while but never got around to it. Finally found a fresh bottle so here goes nothing. Pours an ultra-hazy gold, kind of like fresh pineapple juice, with a creamy white head that dissipates surprisingly quickly for a rye beer. Nose of muted grapefruit and pineapple and a very distinct rye graininess and spice. Nice but nothing terribly special. Initial taste is of vaguely tropical fruits and maybe a slight (possibly purely subconscious?) hint of Sauvignon blanc, but I'm wondering if I just imagined that because Nelson Sauvin. Follows shortly with the same rye grain note, quite prominent on the back end. Moderate bitterness, with a feel that is creamy and slightly juicy. Overall? This is a good beer and one I'd drink again. It is not, however, the mind blowing beer as the hype might have you believe.",0.6686393912031204,4.0,0.965
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"373/420  Pours very dark brown near black oil, very minimal heavily burnt over-roasted head. Oily consistency in the glass.  Smooth sweet aroma of port, umami-soy sauce, vanilla, dark chocolate, sweet oak, dark fruits and a touch of bourbon. Tastes follows the nose well - a lot of port, umami, dark fruit and chocolate. Very nice sweet vanilla and booze on the finish. Very vanilla forwards as it warms.   Beast of a beer, drinks like a port - kind of strange liquor. Do not pick up on nearly as much bourbon as I anticipated and hoped for, but it still works well. I anticipated this being much richer in espresso and dark chocolate considering the 2011 is the base. The PVW was significantly better",0.6597216662927885,4.5,0.965
Black Tuesday,"What a classy beer from a classy brewery. Just as the bottle suggests, this is one elegant beer. Appearance and mouthfeel are both good, but the smell and taste are darn right awesome.

Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Bottle purchased at 3F for 9 euro, into a wine glass; Bottled 4/25/11  A - Pours a clear deep garnet with one and a half fingers of pink foam.  S - Big aroma of tart cherries complemented with some must, but not very heavy must. A faint amount of oak. Pretty straightforward, but smells great.  T - Again, big tart cherry , but there is more musty funk in the taste than what I got from the aroma. Quite tart indeed, but not at all acetic. Earthy funk brings a mild bitterness. A bit of lemon in the finish. Extremely tasty.  M - Light and crisp with low carbonation. Tart throughout, but some bitterness creeps in on the finish.  O - Very tasty kriek. The flavors from the fruit are very nice. I enjoyed this more than the regular 3F Oude Kriek. Wish it were cheaper (and easier to find) in the US...",0.6765632217495553,4.5,0.965

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Huge maple aroma right out of the gate and a vicious, dark pour. Maple dominates the nose but chocolate, barrel, and some coffee see also present. The mouth feel is massive and coats the mouth for days with adequate carbonation. It all makes for an impressive experience, but the taste falls well short of world class. There is a sour note that I also found in Mornin Delight. Some reviews have described it as coffee bitterness, but that's not what I get. It tastes like an off flavor. Since I've tasted the same thing twice I'm quite sure this isn't just a bad bottle. I'm not a fan of MD and the barrel aged version doesn't cover over the flaws.",0.6325335351298461,4.25,0.9649

Not as black as you might think, dark around the rim and doesn't appear super thick  Nose- straight vanilla, then some sweet milk chocolate then bourbon. Vanilla is really crazy strong, even for a 2012. Slight booze.   Taste: this is a dessert. Vanilla, chocolate and bourbon. Vanilla is still extremely prominent, then sweet chocolate whole bourbon and sweet oak is present throughout. Very rich and decadent, drink this by itself.   Overall: this is a liquid dessert, much like a port or brandy. Would be fantastic with a flour-less chocolate cake with rich vanilla icing. This is a fantastic beer, for sure, but it's so rich is a ""this is my only beer tonight"" kind of beer",0.6199572011255248,4.75,0.9648

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Bottle #505 of 688   I had two bottles of this in two days of crazy beer tasting. This review is from day #2 in comparison with the other DL variants  A - as expected, pours black with a chocolaty head  S - sweet bourbon with lots of fudgy chocolates and a bit of soy  T - sweet vanilla opens this up, and is quickly replaced by fudgy chocolates. Spicy bourbon flavors move in and are cut into by more chocolate flavors. This is really sweet and the bourbon is very well integrated into this.  M - smooth and full like all of the other DL barrel aged varieties  D - nice version of DL...this is my 2nd favorite barrel aged bottle version behind the vanilla bean. The bourbon adds a nice complexity and takes away from some of the cloying sweetness that plagues the regular version of DL.  http://www.flickr.com/photos/[email protected]/8159864035/in/photostream",0.6080026315763826,4.0,0.9647

Lovely offering from the Hill,0.6885546704184983,4.5,0.9647
Haze,"This beer is good but certainly not in my top 10 for DIPAs. It looks hazy as expected with a nice orange hue. It has good citrus smells and flavor with a slightly dank bitter aftertaste which again is good but not great. There are so many breweries that aren't hyped up nearly as much as TH that do it better (for example Cellarmaker). Other than Julius, which is an excellent yet one dimensional juice bomb, I don't see why everyone is going so ape shit over this brewery.  Had this beer again with fresher cans.

Good retention with moderate lacing. Easily roused to a finger-height head with little agitation  Smell: Incredibly tropical and fruity. Mango, guava, peach, apricot. Mild pine and resin but the fruits predominate. Increasing pine character as it warms.  Taste: Typical pine and resin. Nothing surprising. But of orange-juice / rind  Feel: Fairly high carbonation. Deceivingly thick mouthfeel. Fair amount of alcoholic heat but I wouldn't place it at 9.4%  Overall: Great stuff. Absolutely intoxicating aroma and very balanced flavor.

Oude Geuze Vintage,"2007 vintage. Poured from a 750 mL caged and corked bottle into a tulip. Thanks goodstrongbeer for bringing this out!  Appearance: This pours a cloudy tangerine color with a golden border and a champagne color right at the edge of the glass. A small creamy white head forms initially.  Smell: This is a tightly wound aroma of fruit and sour notes. Nice horse blanket funkiness. Tart apples, sour white grapes, and a little woodiness as well.  Taste: Up front the flavor is quite tart, with tangerine pushing its way to my palate's forefront. An aggressive barnyard flavor comes through.   Mouthfeel: This is very smooth, sour, acidic, and dry. A refreshing carbonation keeps this feeling light.  Overall: Funky, very complex, and quite enjoyable. As my lambic experience grows, this is definitely one I would like to revisit in order to appreciate more of the complexity that I may have missed. Nonetheless a fantastic beer.",0.7109804358927181,4.5,0.9645
Black Tuesday,"It poured a very dark brown color - almost like a heavy barleywine. There was very little foam, head dissolved quickly. Aroma was alcohol laden with strong notes of vanilla and some chocolate. The booze just kind of sucker punched me in the face. The taste was similar, just instantly boozy with the alcohol burn coming in quickly. But then it transformed to a very sweet liquid desert with rich notes of vanilla. The bourbon character is there once you can get past all that booze and it starts to warm up. Eventually it almost becomes a chocolate liqueur. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, nothing too extraordinary. Overall I did not care for this beer and clearly I'm in the minority. Granted it did have strong notes of vanilla which was a plus but I still found this beer boozy and hot.",0.6624431407400649,3.5,0.9645
Enjoy By IPA,"Pours a golden yellow, which is quite lovely. Head is foamy and white and retains well. Lacing is tight and everywhere. Tangerine, citrus, and dank hops form a juicy, hoppy aroma. Nice juicy dank and piney hop flavors with a bit of citrus and tangerine to back it up. Good balance, which leans on the bitter hoppy side. Mouth feel is a bit harsh on the carbonation side, but otherwise manageable. Not as full as other IPAs either. Overall, a good solid IPA. Didn't deliver as well as I thought it would (my first Enjoy By), but it's still quality.   Served in a 12oz snifter. Bottled March 14th. Drank March 26th.

Green,"Green is another spectacular offering from Tree House, which may very well be my favorite brewery. It is turbid as usual with an impenetrably bright yellow orange hue. It smells very tropical as if you were taken to Jamaica. The taste reflects the smell with significant pineapple. There is some sizzling of the hops on the tongue at first, but then this beautifully pillow-like, super smooth creaminess takes over. It is hard to tell if I like Green or Julius more, but I think Julius has a slight edge. World Class Brew.",0.6675395666398984,5.0,0.9643
Green,"Look: Poured from Green can into Treehouse pint glass. Can had canning date of 5/23/2018 on bottom. Pours a cloudy light orange opaque color with a creamy settled head. Smell: Fruity and floral, pleasant and complex yet fairly mild Taste: Notes of orange peel, grapefruit, and tangerine first hit the palate, followed by the galaxy hops which add a strong bitter kick to the end. The combination of flavors provides a great baseline of what tastes should be in an American style IPA Feel: Smooth medium body, somewhat light and creamy feel. Very drinkable and easy to forget this beer is 7.5% ABV Overall: This is a classic and delicious American Style IPA. Combines much what both east and west coast style IPA's do best. This rating may not be fair to the beer because the brewery that makes it. I've had too many Treehouse beers that I prefer over this one, yet this is still a world class beer and should a favorite for any who prefer this specific style.",0.6978824558860369,4.25,0.9643
Beatification,This is my favorite Russian River sour of all time. This and Compunction are very close 1 and 2. This pours a beautiful peach color and smells super tart like their other sours. very little head with quick retention and carbonation. Really nice and fruity with perfect balance.,0.6525018078001501,5.0,0.9643
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Night sky brown. Thin chocolate head that dissipated quickly. Nice film lays on top. Foam rings to the side. First whif is a bourbon booziness. Subtle coffee can be found behind. This is one of the best balanced bourbon stouts I've had. Like I'm drinking a fresh ground iced coffee with a bit of chocolate added a hint of oak and a shot of some quality bourbon. Very smooth rich feel. A tiny bit of water and oil going on, otherwise I'd push higher. Fantastic beer.",0.6604896893498811,4.75,0.9642
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Poured into a tulip. Brewed in 2009 (label), bottled in 2011 (cork).  3.5 A: Fairly clear plum colored first pour. Three fingers of fizzy pink head that falls quickly and leaves no lacing.  4.5 S: Raspberry is huge in this. Tart, sweet, and powerful. Like any good Cantillon fruit, this is full of acid, but low on funk. Tons of lactic acid with a mild to moderate acetic component. Underneath there is a light musty basement type funk.  4.0 T: Moderately sour with a good tart pucker factor. Raspberry and tangy lactic acid galore. Surprisingly, there's a good bit of funk in there as well. Musty basement, rotting wood, and a mild cheesiness. Sharp, tart raspberry finish.   3.0 M: The mouthfeel is kinda dull. Lighter medium body. The carbonation is on the lower end for the style, but good enough. The problem is that it isn't very spritzy. Creaminess is lacking as well. This sits rather dead on the tongue.  4.0 D: Tasty framboise. A bit hard to justify the price, but good for a special occasion, like a Pens playoff game.",0.6818909381530279,4.0,0.9642
Swish,"16oz can courtesy of BabyTree, thanks man! Super hazy orange, good head, good lacing. Aroma is mostly citrus, bits of pineapple. Flavor has some malt which I was not expecting and then a really good citrusy hoppiness. Nice and juicy.",0.6687926002301581,3.75,0.9642
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"Love BBBM and love Jackie O's. Dark pour and thick head. Nice strong bourbon backbone, and chocolaty molasses maple nose and taste. There's some burnt caramel sugary tones in here that really make it a nice late night warmer!",0.6220914866330257,4.5,0.9641
Darkstar November,"Darkstar november '15 consumed 161127  Pours an oily black color with a small, nut brown head. Its head leaves back a tiny amount of lacing, which foams up after swirling, together with some slick alcohol legs.  Smells of sweet molasses, spicy licorice, bitter chocolate and melting caramel, creating a very sweet note. Has a boozy oaken quality on top, which compliments perfectly to the molasses and chocolate, making this even sweeter on the nose.  Has a very low carbonation, thick and warming on the palate with a satisfying, bigger body, smooth and creamy throughout.  Tastes of chewy, sugary molasses, toffee and a pleasant earthy bitterness, revealing bitter chocolate and creamy fudge. Turns quite warm during mid palate with lots of licorice, spicy oak and creme brulee. Looses its bitter balance during the finish, while the sweetness at the same time gets toned down, due to lots of whipped cream and an even silker mouthfeel.   So sweet, still nice as a decadent dessert with a convincing bitter chocolate balance.",0.6818778880365639,3.75,0.9641
Black Tuesday,"General: So I got this at a white elephant gift exchange with our company. Everyone passed it up because they are all liquor drinkers so I was thrilled to pick it up! Poured this into a small tulip for tasting purposes. I live near The Bruery, about 15 minutes away or so and I have a big problem with their beers. They are going bigger and stronger only. There is no intricate 5% ABV beer in the tasting room, only beers above 10% ABV. That's not my style but I'm going review this fairly and not allow my prejudice to get into it.   Appearance: Black as it gets, this is really dark and has a slightly tan head that diminishes quickly.  Aroma: A slight chocolate hint with a bourbon aroma. there is also a big alcoholic aroma to this. It's intricate though at least, there are undertones of caramel and maybe some sort of rock fruit like a prune or something.  Mouthfeel: This is thick, it is almost like it's got cream in it. It's kind of crazy how much booze in this, I can feel a burn the entire way down to the stomach.  Taste: Booze booze booze. What little flavor of bourbon and chocolate is there is really overpowered by booze but that's what this was intended to be so OK. I'm not a big fan of this beer but for someone who wants a big strong beer, this is it.   Overall: Again it's a Bruery beer. I'm not impressed with the flavors that they developed, I'm more impressed that they created a beer that was 18.9% ABV. This isn't my style but I'm not going to give it poor marks because of that. It is what it is, it's a super strong beer that has a slight chocolate flavor with a hint of bourbon.",0.6261292885795242,4.75,0.9641
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Appearance: Looks like DL, pitch black, oil slick, etc, etc  Smell: Only a hint of oak on the scent. Lots of roast malt and molasses.  Taste: Did they add sugar to this one as well? If so, why? Roast malt, molasses, brown sugar, milk chocolate, semi-sweet baking chocolate. The oak is huge on the taste, like a fresh oak barrel. Too much barrel actually. Much hasher than the regular DL or VB DL.  Mouthfeel: Great - thick, chewy, smooth, near perfect.  Drinkability: To much fresh, wet oak and I get some added sugar. Regular DL is better, but honestly none of the three is T-50 worthy in my opinion.",0.6434546984394496,3.0,0.9641
Peche 'n Brett,"A: Hazy, golden orange color with a white head that doesn't stick around for too long. S: The second best peach smelling beer to VSP. Holy hell, it just hits you in the face with fresh peach skins with a touch of funk and a little oak, but mostly a huge peach bomb. T: Nice peach with some funk and oak dryness on the back. The taste isn't as peach heavy as the smell, but still very nice. M: Has the nice creamy mouthfeel that helps with the lacto that you feel more than you taste. O: I was really pumped to try this and it was very good. It's not as good as VSP, but it's a solid beer",0.6321890478227764,4.5,0.964
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Bottle (2007)  Thanks for opening this with me, mrbubbler!  Slightly hazed rose and dark pink in color with a moderately sized off-white head that lasts longer than expected, eventually leaving dots of stick down the glass.  A big blast of fresh raspberry leaps from the glass, along with big amounts of stinging sourness, along with a mild, funky, earthy character. Superb.  The flavor is exceptional, with a huge combination of fresh raspberry and big sour notes, along with mild leather and some funk. This is so good it seems simple. All the desired flavors are so big, pronounced, and expressive, it doesn't get much better than this.  Medium bodied with high carbonation. A joy to drink.  Simply phenomenal.",0.6975763850222747,5.0,0.9639
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"On tap at DLD 09. Pour to a jet black with just a hint of brown, a thin dark brown skim of head that lingers well and okay lacing. But it ain't about appearances. Nose was a very potent and pleasant mix of aged wood, pourbon, chocolate, toffee and caramel, and as it warmed, the alcohol snuck in as well. Mouthfeel was full, a tad biting and oily. Taste was the highlight, as it took all the scents of the nose and blended them into a very complex taste where every sip seemed to accentuate a different aspect.  Finish was log, smooth and warming. FFF served this in small cups, which was a good thing, given the various beers to be tasted and the 14% abv.",0.6832398627540676,5.0,0.9638

Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Pours bright and honey colored with a medium haze and minimal head.   Smells sweet and sour with some pleasant medicinal herbs mixed in: lemongrass, lemon peel, peppery yeast, chardonnay oak. Delicate, very nicely barreled.  Tastes like it smells: a lemony, peppery wisp of summer. Medium tart (it's a few months old and wears its age very well). Not much by way of the honey sweetness and intense brett that others have described. The lemon prevails throughout, starting like lemon juice and ending like a shock tart, saison barley evening things out, ending on pepper and light wood.",0.6548089448469471,4.25,0.9638
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"2015 bottling.  A: Pitch-black pour with a tall and fizzy black head. Color drains quickly, as does the head itself. No lacing.  S: Heavy, heavy, heavy bourbon. Extremely bold caramel and toffee and oak notes. There is some sweet chocolate underneath but I don't even get any coffee in the aroma. It basically smells like pure bourbon but without the heat.  T: Again, extreme bourbon levels. Loads of caramel primarily. But now the coffee kicks in. Loads of fresh coffee beans with a crapload of sweet milk chocolate (probably more bittersweet but I think the bourbon is sweetening up the whole thing). Some roastiness and then into the finish you get another taste of that coffee, this time much more bitter along with tons of dark, decadent chocolate. Lingering caramel and oak with plenty of alcohol sting.   M: Heavy, thick, lower carbonation. Syrupy as a result.  O: Another sensational Jackie-O's stout. HUGE stout flavors loaded with coffee, chocolate and bourbon. It's very sweet and very syrupy - drinkability does suffer a bit but the strong booziness helps cut it quite a bit. Flavors are bold and sharp and in-your-face. Not for the timid. Tremendously tasty stout.",0.6540411894853854,4.75,0.9638
Sip Of Sunshine,"Poured from a 16 oz can into a snifter. Canned 9/16/16.  A: Pours a somewhat hazy, golden color with a slight reddish-orange hue. One-inch, foamy, white head with good retention. Thick, white, billowy lacing throughout.  S: Aromas of tropical fruit and citrus consisting of orange, pineapple, melons, mango, passionfruit, and grapefruit. Dank and piney hops come through strong as well.  T: Evenly fought battle between the fruity and hoppy characters with strong notes of grapefruit, orange, and tropical fruit accompanied by piney and resiny hop bitterness.   F: Medium bodied, smooth, and crisp with good carbonation. Slightly dry.  O: Overall, a great DIPA. Awesome balance between the fruitiness and hoppy bitterness. The balance is very elite and makes Sip extremely drinkable. Slight juicy character. Very unique. Would love to try this fresh. Well worth the search to get this.",0.7086407398716583,4.75,0.9638
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Burg shared this gem with everyone at the Swamp Head Batch 600 release. A huge want of mine. Thanks man! 2010 Sticker on this one pours bright red with a mostly white with a pink hued read on top. Aroma of barnyard funk, yeast, hay, dust, and big juicy raspberries. Flavor follows just the same with lots of dusty barnyard funk and plenty of juicy raspberries. Dry oaky finish. Body is light, pretty dry on the finish, and has medium plus carbonation. Oh yea. This is good. Glad I finally got to try it.",0.6272993488804142,4.25,0.9638
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"'05 Vintage.   Very nice lambic from Cantillon. Pours a raspberry color with a thin pink head.  The nose has lots of wild mountain raspberries, oak, musty funk, horse blanket, and damp soil.   Taste has mixture of sweet and tart raspberries up front and through the finish. Red pinot grapes, oak, sour funk and an earthy famyard presence.   Very dry yet full body has an acidic finish. Perfect carbonation enhances every flavor. Perfect blend of fresh raspberries and the usual Cantillon funk. One of the best offering from Cantillon thus far.",0.6857848063370123,5.0,0.9638
Coolship Red,"2019 vintage; drank 4/5/19 @ Yuss Haus Mach III.  I found this less subtle than the 'regular' Coolship, which was a revelation for me. Fruit forward & enjoyable, but a bit one-note.   The base beer is a delicate beauty, best enjoyed on it's own. This will do in a pinch though!",0.6378932869291032,4.0,0.9638
Juicy,"L: Darker than I thought it would be; More of a deep amber-hued body with a generous 1cm white foamy head with decent retention S: Tropical fruits, pineapple, mango, and of course a healthy amount of funk on the nose T: Burst of peach, Meyer lemon, and mango is met by a delicate tartness F: Light and pillowy mouthfeel with a lactic coating on the finish O: As malleable a saison as I've ever encountered, Juicy takes on aspects of a tart wild ale, rustic farmhouse ale, and juicy DIPA in a very clean and well orchestrated flavor profile. While I've been nothing but impressed with HF's offerings, Juicy truly separates itself in my perspective. This was a novel beer in many regards to my palate and one I thoroughly enjoyed. While it certainly lives up to its namesake, the soft tartness and delicate mouthfeel only serve to enhance the experience. Nicely done.",0.729673583920023,4.75,0.9638
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2007 Edition, from a 750 ml green bottle, capped and corked. Fizzy pink head on the pour that quickly subsides. Cloudy, somewhat murky deep garnet hue.  Sour, tart and sweet raspberry characteristics in the aroma, some acidity and funk in the background.  Acidic and tart raspberry in the flavour which sweetens up a bit in the middle, with a sour funk on the finish. Some bready malt rises up well into the aftertaste, almost but not quite replacing the acidity.  Medium-bodied, slick and sticky texture, with a moderate amount of carbonation.  Enjoyed this one much more than the Kriek, perhaps the raspberries marry better with the style and blending a bit more based on their inherent nature. Definitely one to pick up if it's available, the fruit does this one justice.",0.7086447800740833,4.0,0.9638
Green,"This is my very first Tree House offering, and it was absolutely amazing. I lucked out and picked up 12 of these and 12 of the Alter Ego.

Sip Of Sunshine,"Thanks to leftpaw for bringing this out to Oregon for our vacation week this summer. Pours mostly a golden yellow color. Good clarity to it. 1/2"" white head on the top. Passes the looks test. Aroma was pretty standard, a little bit of grapefruit and tree to it. Didn't pop anything tropical for me. There was nothing wrong with it, but I guess underwhelming might be appropriate here given the amount of commercial tug job hype for the tropical notes.   Taste was good, more of the citrus and pine edge to it. Pale toasted malts. Why is this rated so high? Its a good ipa. Oh, (checks region). Only in Florida could this be rated higher I guess. I did think it hid the alcohol pretty well.",0.6280071640865069,3.75,0.9637
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Purchased at The Nova's (Hudson, WI). Hurt the wallet.  A deep and clear pink color with a light pink-rose head. Soft cherries in the aroma and the signature 3F notes. Fruit in taste but the essence, not the flesh. Cherry, of course. Good sourness, very clean, big on oak. Amazingly light and clean feel, drinks like the FG was 1.000. Thoroughly enjoyable.  4.5, 4.5, 4, 4.5, 4.5",0.647499514497808,4.5,0.9636
Enjoy By IPA,"On tap into a pint glass. Pours clear golden color with a two finger head that sticks around and leaves lacing 1/3 way down the glass. Strong but balanced nose of peppery, dank, and citrus hops. Taste is complex but redeeming with pale malt, citrus, pine, and dank hops with clean finish. Medium body and medium high carbonation with a perfectly subtle bitterness. Fantastic IPA. Enjoy by 4/20 isn't over-hyped.",0.7152018654580646,4.5,0.9636
Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,"This beer has a thin off white head to a beautifully clear golden clear beer.  It smells of honey dankness.  Tastes follows the nose pretty well. Almost a honey like sweetness with slight dank earthy qualities. Some pine.  Feeling is wet, thick and sticky. Coats the mouth well.  Overall, I can see how hopslam and this get related. This held up to expectations",0.6541264443880358,4.25,0.9636
Oude Geuze Vintage,"A - Bottled on 07/03/2002. Pours a clear golden amber with a mixture of bubbles. An inch of frothy white head reduces to a finger's-worth over the course of a minute.  S - Aroma fills the room as soon as the bottle is opened. Barnyard funk, green apple, hay, sour solvents, slight (not unpleasant) mustiness. Really nicely refined.  T - Sour element is immediately present, although it takes some time to grow to its full potency mid-drink. It comes in the guise of under ripe apples, rather than perhaps lemon or vinegar. Finish is very dry and sourness lingers too. I was hoping that the subtlety of the aroma would be retained in the taste, but it just comes off as not very complex.  M - Light-to-medium body with quite a creamy feel, due in part to the soft carbonation.  D - Pretty good, although outclassed by others in the style - certainly is a bit one-dimensional when compared with the better Guezes I've tried.",0.693464545396708,3.5,0.9635
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"Imperial porter brewed with maple syrup and aged in bourbon barrels. Poured from a bottle into a Wicked Weed snifter. Very dark, nearly black pour with about a finger of tan head that quickly dissolves to a lacy ring around the glass. Rich notes of bourbon, dark fruit, chocolate, and vanilla.  Full body with a smooth feel and a rich, bourbon-forward flavor. Some roastiness and a substantial amount of dark fruit up front provide a combination of bitter and tart flavors, but there is enough malt sweetness to balance it out and provide notes of brown bread and crackers. At mid-palate, the barrel character swoops in and adds even more sweetness in the form of toasted oak, vanilla, dark chocolate, and alcohol. The dark fruit persists across the palate, the sweet and toasty malt dies out, and the finish is all dark fruit and bourbon barrel, with a lingering alcohol warmth and a faint puckery tartness. I'm not sure the maple syrup contributes much. Perhaps it's integrated with the malty sweetness up front.  It's hard not to like this beer. There's lots of bittersweet chocolate, dark fruit, and bourbon. Porters all seem to have a characteristic roasty note to them and this one doesn't have it because the barrel character dominates everything. It's more like a stout with a thinner mouthfeel. Whatever it is, one thing is certain. Jackie O's has one heck of a serious barrel-aging program going one.",0.6751401520787358,4.5,0.9635
Beatification,Look - very high carbonation and a clear pale yellow/straw color - stays quite active. Smell - decent amount of funk from 'spontaneous fermentation' - slight vinegar hint. Taste - pretty powerful blast of sourness and tart fruit - slight yeast and bread - some malt - mostly sour but backs off and other flavors come through then. Feel - medium bodied (which is a bit fuller than a typical barrel aged sour) and stays at a higher level of carbonation than expected. Overall - this is a great beer - I picked up this bottle in the original R.R. tap room in March 2019 - not as sour as I expected with a spontaneous fermented beer - a bit more complexity in this one as well - very enjoyable,0.7037199947442113,4.25,0.9635
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Poured into a 2016 Darkstar November glass, with a quarter finger of foam that persists. I can smell this from about a foot away as I pour it. Tons of caramel and dark fruit on the nose with chocolate fudge, toffee, butterscotch, hops, and a smidge of black licorice. Palate is fantastic: fudge, oak, caramel, toffee, butterscotch, and oak working together, and finishing with leather, tobacco, more oak, and hop resin. Super rich mouthfeel; perhaps a smidge cloying but otherwise delicious and decadent. Far better and more interesting than Black Note.",0.6125144627561955,4.75,0.9635
Aaron,"My 50th different Hill Farmstead beer. Poured from the bottle into a snifter. Pours a very very dark brown that allows no light to pass through with very minimal dark khaki head. Aromas are so wonderful, caramel, vanilla, bourbon abound. Flavors are flat out perfect. Booze perfectly balanced with caramel, vanilla, sticky bourbon. Mouthfeel is excellent. Just chewy enough. Overall, this beer is flat out amazing.",0.6850411672178445,4.75,0.9635
Coconut B-Bomb,"Had a couple of glasses on tap at the brewery. Probably the best Fremont beer I have had since Brew 1000 and this one might be better. Smell is fantastic and the taste is better, and I am really not a big coconut fan in general but it works perfectly in B-Bomb. I think this is the best beer I have had in 2017.",0.5836858873090479,4.75,0.9634
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"12 oz pour on tap into snifter.  A: Pitch black in appearance completely almost brimmed pour so no head.  S: Cinnamon, green peppers, light bits of whiskey  T: Peppers and cinnamon are on the fore front. A light touch of coffee and some bourbon a little vanilla and toffee and something almost mint like and medicinal, then the cinnamon comes back with a nice heat finish.   M: A little thin for a stout, but I will put that down with it being barrel aged.   O: A very good spicy beer that the bourbon lends a hand to nicely. The only thing I would ding this beer for is that slight mint/medicinal taste that is there and gone quickly. Also wished it had better mouthfeel. Overall, if you can get past the high price tag this is a good beer.",0.6308422364104991,4.25,0.9634
Swish,"Thanks for the hookup Mike! 2 weeks old!  Pours out that super turbid/hazy golden orange Trillium, Tree House, Hoof looking type of DIPA.  Aroma is super juicy and tropical with a nice green, earthy dank note too. Sweet, juicy orange, pineapple, mango, peach, tangerine, grapefruit.   Taste is also very juicy and tropical, but has a great finishing earthy, herbaceous dank note too that I love. Tons of sweet pineapple juice, mango, peach, orange, grapefruit, orange zest, very dank and sticky on the back. Lots going on here.  Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel, lighter bitterness (think single IPA) and NO HINT OF 8%!  Didn't know what to expect and completely blown away!

Vicinity,"d 04/12/17, it pours (you guessed it) cloudy gold orange color with a foamy 2 finger off white head that was full of bubbles, fading very slowly and leaving good spotty lacing. The second can of the night left much better lacing and a foamy layer on top. Classic New England IPA looks.  Smells of grapefruit rind and pithy lemon up front with orange peel, tangerine, mango, fresh squeezed orange juice and a punch bowl of tropical fruit. The malt backbone jumps in right away with toasted grains and graham cracker, followed by some caramel, piney hops, musty grapes, light peppery spices and floral notes like dry floral hops.  Tastes of wet citrus hops and fresh squeezed orange juice up front followed by the same hoppy lineup as the nose: lemon, grapefruit, blood orange, tangerine, pineapple, melon and then dank piney hop notes, herbal accents like tea leaf, peppery spices and floral hops. It finishes with toffee, buttery cracker, toasted grains and sweet malt. Very well balanced with a mild bitterness, this goes down very smooth and easy, hiding the 8% ABV masterfully. A lot of fruit to take in all at once, but it's a very tasty and almost refreshing DIPA that still packs a punch.  Big thanks to ""Boccu"" for waiting in line up at the brewery and bringing back a great haul to Long Island.",0.6590863723866258,4.5,0.9634
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Lot 11/30/2006, 750ml bottle.  Not the slightest bit of pop when removing the cork. Pours a flat, super clear golden color on first pour. Nice color and clarity, but a somewhat alarming lack of carbonation. Smell is of tart lemons, hay, grass, and lactic sourness. Very complex smell overall, seems ""mature"" to me. The taste is quite sour with tart lemons being most prevalent, followed by fresh cut grass and dried hay notes. The mouthfeel is almost totally flat, as expected, and light bodied. Overall, a very nice sour that did not disappoint. Had it retained any carbonation, it might have been truly exceptional. All the same, really glad to have tried it.",0.7094237248384836,4.0,0.9634

It quite literally tastes like Seizoen Bretta blended with peach juice. The amount of fruit in this is insane, without actually just tasting like a peach soda.

Sure Bet,"Appearance - The beer poured a murky orange-yellow color with white bubbles crown and glass.   Smell - The beer had a huge mango nose with some dankness also detected.   Taste - At the front, this is a big syrupy and slightly spicy double IPA. Sweet fresh mango blends nicely with the dank. The honey helps to lay a sweet backbone. At slightly sweet dankness lingered.   Mouthfeel - Talk about full-bodied beers. This one surrounds the palate.   Overall - Given the opportunity, I would buy this again.",0.6760063813423243,4.5,0.9633
Nectarine Premiere,"On tap at the brewery today.  The beers pours a hazy golden amber color with good head retention and attractive lacing. As good as this beer looks, of course it smells even better. There is a huge pithy aroma of fresh, ripe nectarines (shocker, I know), coupled with light pepper, light vanilla and underlying earthiness (for lack of a better description). This beer smells great. The flavor profile replicates the nose, but the sour component struck me as just a bit much. It blends in well with all the fresh fruit, but it pushes aside the sweetness, leading to some subtle astringency on the finish. The finish is fairly dry otherwise, with plenty of sour pucker power that just lasts and lasts. Alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile, though I wasn't surprised to learn that the abv. was in the 7% range.   Another solid effort from dG, but then what's new.",0.7216635688250542,4.25,0.9633
Todd The Axe Man," nice and hazy yellow-orange appearance with good carbonation as well.  Has big citrus, tropical fruit, herbal dankness, and some pine as well on the aroma. Tastes are hop forward with citrus, tropical fruit and herbal notes. Has aassertive hop bite as well.  The palate is medium with a resiny finish that lingers pretty well.  Overall an excellent ipa that while overpriced is worth it on draft.",0.6871365902260209,4.5,0.9633
Darkstar November,"Tried from the bottle at Ladyface 8th Anniversary Invitational. 1/21/18.  Pours like motor oil, with a nice tan head of foam.  Boozy! Dark fruit, roasty, and full of bourbon, caramel, and molasses on the nose.  More booze, more molasses. Caramel, roasty malt, hints of dark chocolate. So powerful, a real asskicker.  Thick, syrupy, and sticky sweet. A really great body that would really benefit from some cellar time.",0.6156589434577573,4.25,0.9633
Nectarine Premiere,"Appearance - nice white foam head that lingers, cloudy orange color that looks like OJ, Aroma has tons of citrus notes - the nectarine is immediately noticeable, slight funk notes as it warms - Taste is out of this world good - so much citrus juice-like acidity that compliments the lactic acid and makes this beer next level good. Body is full and balanced, sour with the citric & lactic acid but they pair so well together in this beer especially with the sweetness of the nectarine. Overall this beer has so much character and amazingly well made.",0.7072405451707217,4.75,0.9632
Todd The Axe Man,One of the best IPAs that I've ever tasted. Nice light straw color with a beautiful aftertaste. Slightly piny and earthy. You cant really tell by the aroma just how good this beer is. Love it!!!,0.6626135648747888,5.0,0.9632
Chocolate Rain,"Cocoa sweet boozy drain pour. I want with all my heart to praise this beer and to say that what I gave for it was remotely worth it. I wouldn't trade a six pack of your favorite AB-INBEV product for another bottle. Overly sweet, overly misplaced boozy in a very non clever way. This smelled like something my brother would have cooked up in his ""cooking class"" when he was postulating drug addled kittens. The mouth feel was nice and thick, like poisonous pancake syrup.

Vicinity,"Pours out that classic Trillium haze for daze, but a slightly lighter orange this time.  Aroma starts off bright and tropical with mango, apricot, orange and then some white grape/grape juice and a hint of earthy dankness.  Guava and mango on the taste with apricot, orange and white grape juice following with a dank, earthy, slightly piney finish and hints of stone fruits. Very tropical and juicy, but not one note.  Medium bodied, crisp clean, NO TRACE OF ALCOHOL which is always impressive! Moderate bitterness and carbonation.  Super easy to drink and awesome as usual! Not the best from them, but damn amazing as always!",0.6798427670024884,4.5,0.9632
Black Tuesday,"Review from notes.  Had this at a Jackie O's bottle share. Date, can't remember, didn't write it down, lol.  Pour was about 3 oz. Looks fantastic, dark as night, nice dark mocha head that is about a finger tall, and sticks around pretty well given the ABV.  Smells like a bourbon barrel stout should, with roast, chocolate, coffee, and booze, and the booze is readily apparent, which shouldn't be surprising with the ABV, but...  GAH! Rocket fuel! Roast and chocolate give way to an unbearable fusel alcohol that just doesn't taste good. Burns all the way down. I feel like I can light my breath on fire.  Just not pleasant, and this was a 2010 vintage. I shudder to think what a fresh bottle is like. Maybe the 2010 was just overly boozy. Who knows? I certainly won't go out of my way to find out.",0.5919439688925274,3.0,0.9631
Very GGGreennn,"Batch Canned 6/07/19 and reviewing based on 2 cans consumed within 2 days of canning  L: About as lively of a color as you could want. Looks like opaque pineapple juice with a fluffy meringue head.  S: As soon as you crack the can you can smell that this thing is an unrestrained hop monster. Very bright notes of pineapple, orange pulp, and an unabashed hop-saturated dankness to provide a kick to back up the citrus fruit.  T: Follows the nose as you'd expect only richer and more intense. The flavor seems to be trying to coat every tastebud you have and sticks around with no intention of leaving. A LOT of hop intensity. I would recommend saving this for last if drinking multiple IPAs because anything after it is gonna be swallowed up by the lingering impression of VGgg  F: Lovely, and surprisingly light and soft in the mouth. I wish it were a bit more like King Julius or JM in the way that those beers feel like they're almost expanding in your mouth somehow growing bigger and juicier the longer you taste them. But I'll take the softness with little complaint, as it's a nice contrast to the hyper intense smell and taste.  O: Amazing IPA that I would keep an entire fridge full of if I could.",0.6441312513318977,5.0,0.9631
Enjoy By IPA,"A clear amber orange with loads of carb rising, and a finger of white foamy head that sticks. In the aroma, I get lots of citrus (grapefruit, orange, lemon), a decent amount of the dank, but, not quite oniony vibe, and a nice touch of caramel malt. In the flavor, nice waves of hops and malts that alternate back and forth from sweet to bitter, ending with a pleasant bitter note. Dank is mostly what I'm picking up in the flavor, which is great, but, I think the nose gives off a little more in the way of the citrus. Still, a very tasty brew. The feel is, above average carbonation, full feel, a little oily up front, and, quite dry on the finish. I can see why it's in demand. Nice stuff.",0.6804248218450184,4.5,0.9631
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Thanks to Dyan for supplying this 2002 bottle to go along with the 2001 De Cam and the Blauw. Consumed side-by-side with the Blauw, and I think this one just beat out the other 3F geuze. What an awesome experience. Beer number 9 of the tasting, and number 3 on day 2.  Pours mostly clear with a slight haze, deep rich amber in color. The head is amply and sticky, providing a smattering of bubbles on the side of my tumbler, but nothing that is easily described. The cork blasted right out of the bottle as soon as we undid the cage, but there was no gush as all. The streamers in the beer look majestic. This is flawless.  The aroma is funky, dry, tannic, full of citrus rinds and a briny character, though not nearly as much so as the 2001 De Cam Oude Lambiek. Light and bright, their is a soily earthiness that makes me feel like I just buried my nose in a compost heap. The flavor is phenomenal as well, as dry and oaky tannins combine with an earthiness that can only be described as dank and musty forest floor combined with mushrbooms, and sour to the point where I can feel it in my enamel. There is not even a touch of acetic sourness. The acidity that wilts my teeth does not translate any farther into the digestive tract, as my esophagus and stomach are unaffected. The finish is full of lemon and grapefruit zest with more lactic sourness.  The overall feel is a bone dry sensation. Sprity but not overly so, the earthiness, funk, and briney salt water sensation make this an absolute standout among geuze offerings. This is absolutely phenomenal. Armand is a true craftsman.",0.6877621335891909,4.5,0.963
Beatification,"Thanks to MrFootStones for this bottle. Made me happy plus 2 others.  Batch 3  poured into goblet  Color: Golden to blonde with a few orange highlights. A thin white bubbly head appears but quickly reduces to a white ring around the glass. Leaves behind some head retention, but no lace.  Nose: Extreme and complex. Sourness, barnyard textures, funk, lemon scent, and mellow grassy notes.  Palate: Like heaven on the tongue. Extremely drinkable for how sour it is. The carbonation is perfect, no trace of alcohol and its tingles your taste buds. As this beer sits in your mouth waves of sour lemon and oak coat the tongue , later the grassy notes appear in soft gentle way. Truly well crafted.  Finish: Long and dry with plenty of layers. Tart and funky, sour and lightly fruity, and yea very drinkable till the last drop. A masterful sour!  Rating: 97/100",0.6794501674135456,4.5,0.963

Aroma is one area where Enjoy Bys typically shine and this is no exception. A lively bouquet of grapefruit, honey, malt, and citrus. The flavor is hop forward but does so mildly, with a round finish consisting of more grapefruit, melon, earth, and rich malt. The finish is wet and clean with a long bitter touch.

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"This is everything you want with this style of beer. Yellow hazy appearance, banana/clove/bubblegum nose, and moderate carbonization for the mouthfeel.

Nose expresses citric acid and cork. Taste is fairly clean - more acidic notes, cork and a slight peppery quality towards the back. Mouthfeel is light-medium in consistency (but closer to light) with a lively carbonation. All and all, an easy drinking and refreshing geuze that's fairly mellow, despite the the age.

Smells like what you would expect.. yeasty, subtle banana, spice, a bit tangy.  Tastes fantastic. Sharp initially then smooths out letting the yeast, and banana/clove flavors come into play leaving a lingering taste I describe as wheat beer for lack of a better term.

Scaled Up,"Bottle. Pours like your standard Trillium smoothie. Turbid as it gets. Thin white crown. Aroma is that Trillium hop milk I have had many a time before. Just a concentrated mix of several tropical fruits. You got your pineapple and apricot and guava and nectarine and 33 different types of citrus fruit. A bit of earthiness. Dank and Nelsony in a lighter regard. Sweet glazed doughnut malt. Flavor is sweet, juicy, fruity hop ooze. Not high on bitterness as far as Imperial IPAs generally go. Big feel; very creamy and textured. Like an Imperial Stout on the tongue. If I am in the mood for Trillium hop sludge, this one will suffice like any and all of their Pale Ales, IPAs & Imperial IPAs.

Enjoy By IPA,Had the 7/4/16 version near the end of June.   Poured into a snifter glass.   A golden yellow with a nice one finger of head. Not much lacing from this one.  Smell is mostly grapefruit and some pine blended with it. The pine starts to become stronger after it settles.  The taste goes along with the smell with grapefruit and citrus followed by the pine notes. A little sweetness in there and the alcohol starts to come through. Tasted better about the halfway point.  More complex fell than I expected. The hops finally kicked in with some nice bitterness in there. All of it balanced nicely.  A great beer to have fresh. Not sure this one would age well.,0.6698977669217462,4.25,0.9625
Todd The Axe Man,"Murky with ugly dish soap bubbly head.   Smell is pleasant. Pineapple and mango predominantly.  Taste is nice. Finished earthier than expected which I appreciate being a classic IPA guy.  Feel is really light and drinkable.  Over good. I used to chase the top 250 list with trade but never winded up with this one. Here I am a few years later and it's just sitting on the shelf a few miles away from me, no trading required. This is good, and I'd consider buying again if it weren't $15 for a 4 pack.

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"I've been wanting to try this style of beer and figured I might as well try a world class style defining brew so when I saw this at the store I picked it up with high hopes. For starters this is truly a gorgeous looking beer and has one of the best heads I've seen. When it came to trying the beer though I quickly reached the conclusion that this style just isn't for me. I'm generally not a fan of wheat beers and this one just didn't agree with my palate. Strong wheat flavor with slight banana, clove, floral and maybe bubblegum notes. Again this seems like a well made beer and I'm sure it's great if you enjoy similar styles but this one just isn't for me, I didn't enjoy it.",0.6220100442826972,2.5,0.9624
Coconut B-Bomb,This was by far the best adjunct BA beer I've had from Fremont. I was really impressed with its viscosity due to other Fremont BA stouts not being as thick/mouth-coating.

Todd The Axe Man,"16oz can into snifter. Murky dark orange body with a fine ring of lacing and a small head that dissipates quickly. Not hazy like the current craze, more just...murky. Not the prettiest beer but that seems to be of little import for hoppy brews these days.  Aroma is exceptional, very fruity and tropical, with a little sweet biscuit thing detected underneath. The flavor falls just slightly short, not quite as bursting with those fruity characteristics as anticipated, but still quite lovely. The overall vibe is much more Dipa than single; the malt flavors arent simply playing second fiddle, providing some depth and sweetness and mitigating the slightly bitter, grapefruit rind finish.   Body a bit bigger than medium and carbonation slightly under; again these characteristics give the impression of a double. Blindfold I would have guessed this closer to 9% abv.  Good stuff from Surly if not absolute upper echelon or super cutting edge (for what that's worth).",0.710330756235474,4.25,0.9623

The aroma is unmistakably tart, with a lemony-orange hop character. Dry and peppery, with a tart sourness that pops on the palate. Incredible.  2018 vintage. On tap from the source. This pours a pale straw gold color. Lively, effervescent, with notes of strawberry and hay on the nose. Crisp and sharp, with just a hint of funk lingering on the back. This is delicious.

Scaled Up,"16oz can, poured into a Trillium etched snifter glass. Enjoyed from a fresh can on 8.23.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal.  The beer pours a bright golden color, apricot and orange hues, hazy and cloudy with a foamy white head, not super tall with little retention yet lots of lace. The aroma is super citrusy, juicy and crisp but also bitter and rindy with a lot of ""green"" overhop character, hop spice, grassiness, pale grain sweetness and some floral scents that linger. The flavors offer a really bitter hop bite, tons of juiciness as well, very sharp citrus flavors, almost a lime like crispness to it with that same overhopped ""green"" character, some sweetness to counterbalance the beer creeps out and again, a bit of wildflower lingers on the tongue. The mouthfeel is nice, medium body, coating, smooth, moderate carbonation with a dry finish.  Verdict: A nice double IPA from Trillium but easily overhopped and unbalanced. Very juicy, tangy, and refreshing, but a bit too bitter, a bit too green and one dimensional with the citrus. While still a nice beer, not quite up to the standard that Trillium usually achieves.",0.7168828380761246,3.75,0.9622
Black Tuesday,"2015 bottle into a whiskey glass. Pours amaretto-amber color and not black. I thought the bottle came from the top section of the barrel where the watery part of the beer Flores up. The aroma is unequivocally boozy, with some almond, bourbon, and caramel malt characteristics. The taste is also thoroughly boozy--I had to double check the bottle that I'm not drinking port or amaretto. The taste is of peaches, huge vanilla, biscuity, almondy. Interestingly, no chocolate or roasted coffee whatsoever. The mouthfeel: it burns! From the alcohol, like sipping on soju.   I was surprised how transparent it is for a self-described ""black"" stout. I could clearly see the lights through the glass. I felt like I was cheated because of the tenuous stout characteristics. This, and the lack of supporting hops makes me think that this is better classified as a barley wine. Giving the beer a ""stout"" designation misrepresents its quality and unfairly bolsters its appeal. The only redeeming quality of this potion is the malt sweetness, which makes the alcohol somewhat tolerable. Do not attempt this bottle on your own, as it contains 8.9 drinks--more than enough to send someone to neverland. I would have W00tstout 2.0 or BASS any day over this.  $30 at the Bruery.",0.6397333464195133,3.5,0.9622
Society & Solitude #4,On draft at Blackback pub in Waterbury. I also drank a 750 mL of this last week.  The beer appears hazy and golden hued with a half inch of white head. The aroma offers a delectable bouquet of citrus and hops. Malt presence seems minimal - seems very promising so far. OK I'm back...just went to a different universe when I tasted this. To say this is delicious and smooth doesn't begin to do this beer justice. Light bodied without being thin. Dangerously drinkable.

Flora - Blueberry,"375ml bottle, October 12, 2018 bottle dated, poured into a Black Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass.   The beer pours a bright garnet color, cloudy complexion with some beet red hues and a foamy off white head, minimal retention and no lacing. The aroma is nice, blueberry skin, funk, grape must, tart blueberry juice, lemon peel, light oak barrel and a bit of ""bandaid"" aroma that seems a bit plastic like and fairly bitter. The flavors are good, juicy and tangy blueberry, pleasantly tart, lemon zest, wine barrel, musty oak, tannins and a vinous acidity that brings out a nice mineral water forward finish. The mouthfeel is good, coating and creamy with a lively and bright texture that finishes with a tart and dry bite.  Verdict: A very nice fruited Flora variant from Hill Farmstead. The ""bandaid"" character mellows out as it warms up and is really only present in the aroma, but it is certainly a distraction. That being said, the expression of blueberry feels very natural and is quite nice.",0.6934927941709504,4.0,0.9622

A - Pours hazy golden orange with a dense two finger tall white head leaving sticky rings of lace down the entire glass.  S - Smells of fresh citric fruit zest, pungent hops, fresh cut grass, pine needles and some light caramel malt sweetness.  T - Starts off with a ton of hop bitterness that lasts through the finish. The galaxy and citra hops work well together but they are hard to tell them apart at times. Hints of citric fruit zest, grass and pine as well as some sweet caramel help round things out. The finish is quite bitter, lingering on the palate long after the finish.  M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Lots of bitterness throughout with a dry finish, no alcohol detectable at all.  O - A very good DIPA yet again from Hill Farmstead. Not as good as some of their other hoppy beers but it was still a very enjoyable, easy drinking beer.",0.6598937471252685,4.5,0.962
Black Tuesday,"Review from memory, unfortunately. 2013 bottle served in a Duvel tulip. Got the bottle in a Reddit beer trade and split it with a friend. Served slightly cool, not sure of exact temperature.  A- Pours a very dark brown, which is much lighter and clearer than I expected. Pretty much no head.  S- Boozey nose, but that's expected. Rich and oakey.  T- Woahhh bourbon all the way through. Sweet vanilla and chocolate notes down to the burn from the booze. This beer is huge in every way. Almost a little spice character in there along with lots of dark fruits.  M- Thick and velvety, rather than aggressive. Light carbonation.  O- This beer was just a pleasure to drink.",0.6479654153373269,4.5,0.962
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"2010 vintage served in a tulip with the vanilla bean and 2009 DL. Beer is black and thick in the glass. Coats the wall and the swirl leaves legs of alcohol on the walls. There isn't a head or carbonation to speak of but it looks good.  The aroma is slightly hot, oaky, with a lot of roast and a nice smoothness to it. Very liquor. Hints of vanilla, very subtle.   Beer is full bodied and completely coats the mouth. Surprisingly smooth for such a high alcohol beer with such a strong aroma. The woodsiness of the beer mellows out the heat a lot. Lots of roast in the back palate. Drinkability good.",0.6715951921390378,4.0,0.962
Chocolate Rain,"L: pours light brown, but looks black in the glass S: huge sweetness no bourbon. Slight vanilla and chocolate  T: there is the vanilla, big time! Also the heat, a huge beer. Very sweet, which hides the alcohol a bit. But again, very nice vanilla. F: warming for sure, the true definition of a sipper.",0.6064788938019638,4.75,0.9619
Coconut B-Bomb,"L: Dark and rich mocha hues with a thin sandy head S: Dark chocolate and toasted coconut T: Leads with the bourbon barrel and then complemented by cacao nibs, roasted tobacco leaves, toffee, charred vanilla beans, and a lingering sweetness from the coconut F: Medium body with ample carb O: Nice variant in the B-Bomb series; the fresh coconut was subtle for me, but paired well with the delectable robust base profile of B-Bomb - excellent sipper",0.6587559459125191,4.5,0.9619
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"Dark chocolate and jet black hues with a scant head. Tons of maple on the nose in addition to bourbon and espresso. Strong blast of heat on the tongue is met by a sweet mocha, coffee grounds, and trace amounts of syrup. Medium body, but robust as compared to most porters. Very enjoyable bourbon barrel aged brew - wish the bottle were twice as large! Thanks to Brian for the trade.",0.6284719946426639,4.5,0.9619
Society & Solitude #4,"Growler from 9-18-13, drank on 9-29-13. Thanks to DonFrap for snagging this one for me!  This poured a hazy gold color with a foamy, thick off-white head that stays for a long time, leaving lacing down the glass as you go.  The aroma on this thing... wow. After my pour I was sitting back in my chair playing on my phone, a good 3 feet from the glass, and the smell was overpowering. Incredibly mango and citrusy hop and fruit smell.   The taste is an ever-changing complex arrangement that leaves you wishing the bottle was bottomless. At the forefront is a pleasant mango and fruit that tapers off to a biting grapefruit. The way this changes in your mouth is incredible.   Medium mouthfeel with perfect carbonation (even after spending a week and a half in the growler).   I wouldn't change a thing about this beer, except make it available more often.   A must have.",0.6332884027275851,4.75,0.9617
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Disclaimer: I didnt want to love this beer, knowing how tough (impossible) it is to obtain.  Pours a dark, thick syrupy pour. Smells unlike any stout I've had. Definitely sweet maple, sweet barrel notes and roasted malt. Smells amazing.  This is where Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout separates itself from others...taste and mouthfeel. The taste is pure perfection. Sweet, but not overly so. Perfect blend of maple, barrel, coffee and roast. Thick mouthfeel that clings to your entire mouth, making you want another sip.   I wish this would be more readily available.",0.6645931398039449,5.0,0.9617
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"750ml - bottled two years ago.  A - pours an opaque red-ish purple with an ephemeral head. No lace. No bubbles.  S - leather, tart cherry, oak, acetic. The second pour roused some rainy day earthworms which is similar to a wet dog for me. Yuck. It wasn't present in the first pour at all.  T - super tart, dry cherry and lemon peel. Leathery Brett.  M - light body. Mouth watering sourness. Minimal sweetness.   O - intense, dry cherry sour. it's like eating a handful of fresh, sour cherries while wearing a brand new, high quality leather catsuit, only better. Cascade Kriek is more complex and tastier than this, but this is quite good, if you like a super tart cherry beer.",0.6328285522983996,4.0,0.9617
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"On tap at DLD. A nice treat after waiting in the cold for hours. Poured pitch black with zero head and enjoyed in a small plastic cup, just the way it was meant to be had. Smell is rich sweet, sticky molassesy malt with a light bourbon and alcoholic vanilla aroma. Taste is rich, semi sweet, chocolatey, dark fruit fig like flavor with some soy sauce like quality too. Rich oily mouthfeel and light carbonation but a sufficient amount. Really good stuff.",0.6832282757148238,4.0,0.9617
Scaled Up,"Poured 1/11/16 from a 32oz growler that was filled at the brewery on 1/9/16, into an imperial pint glass.  A: The beer is a very cloudy yellowish gold color, with a thin off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thin lace on the glass.  S: The aroma contains a lot of floral hops and fruity citrus along with caramelized malts.  T: The taste starts out bready with a hearty malt character up front. Then a strong grassy hops bitterness comes in. Then there’s some sweetness from flavors of fruity citrus and caramel creating a very good balance. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet.  M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.  O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a very nice 2IPA to drink for a long time.",0.7078573628649759,4.5,0.9617
Green,"Received a Green 16 oz pounder in a trade along with some other great beers from Tree House and Trillium. Did comparison with Green, Alter Ego, Bright w/ Nelson and Artaic. Green won.

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Pours pitch black with light tan head and minimal lacing.   Aroma is booze upfront, then walnuts, chocolate, vanilla .   Taste follows the aroma . Booze upfront. I think in 6 months this would be much better  Mouthfeel is medium but I wish it was just a little thicker.   My opinion is I drank this too early and it could be much better in 6 months. If u love bourbon drink this fresh. But it is very hot",0.6235506264355902,4.25,0.9617
Green,"L: very hazy, light amber in color with a pale straw/off-white head. tight lacing, but the head dissipates to a thin 1/8 inch layer  S: Quite dank with the hop aromas here. Very fresh hops that are more on the fruity side. Pineapple and Tangerine are definitely noticeable per the back of the can. Orange sorbet, not so much. Not overwhelmingly complex, but an extremely dank and fresh nose to this one.  T: Quite leafy. Quintessential IPA character to it with a spicy, leafy finish. Much less fruity on the palate than the nose would suggest. Finishes somewhat dry with a whisper of grain and a lingering, round hop bitterness.  F: medium-full with a nice resiny quality to it. moderate-low carbonation gives this one a feeling of additional heft.  O: This is perhaps the freshest and dankest IPA I've ever had. Not earth shattering, but quite enjoyable to drink. The aroma is quite nice and compared with the other IPA available for purchase that day, Sap, this is definitely the one I prefer.",0.7029319152023044,3.75,0.9616
Juicy,"Poured from a bottle into a HF stem  Cloudy, hazy, gold with a huge fluffy head. Others have reported a gusher, this bottle did no such thing. phew.  There is a nice mustiness to it. There is also a fruitiness I just can't quite place. There is some funky scent in there, a band aid plastic...it all works well together, I'm not a professional at this so my descriptors may be off, but trust me...it works.  There is a lot going on here. Hops start out and a milky, tart finish follows. Again, it's hard for me to describe, but it works.  Rather creamy and well..Juicy. It's kind of like a saison on hop steroids. Feels oh so smooth in the mouth with just a touch of dryness as I swallow.  Really a fantastic beer stretching the boundaries of saison and wild ale. Really an awesome beer. I think I may have enjoyed CD 5 a touch more...but, Shaun is fucking killing it!",0.6120605871334227,4.5,0.9616

Nelson,"Poured from a Green Flash bottle.  Pours bright light orange with a fizzy head that rises, but subsides. Smell is peppery, grassy, dry grapefruit. Big Nelson Sauvin nose. Taste is spicy rye with zesty dry grapefruit. Finishes smooth. Fizzy texture, but dense enough to be pretty slick in the mouth. Great spicy IPA, great use of NS hops.",0.6768168871579086,4.25,0.9615
Mastermind,"Pours a hazy gold with a very fluffy three finger head. That head lasts for quite a while before breaking. Excellent lacing.   Smell is citrusy, with tropical fruits and a strong malt backbone.   Taste is like the nose, citrusy and tropical now with a tiny amount of piney. A strong malt presence is also quite noticable.   Feel is quite nice with a medium body and mild to moderate carbonation. There is a nice tropical fruit aftertaste and the finish is a touch dry.   A very nice beer, but to my liking it doesn't hold up against Second Fiddle. This is nice and enjoyable, and is a damn tasty beer though.",0.6966295845564079,4.25,0.9614
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Bottle 10/16/2018: Pours an oily black with brown edges into a black mirror of a body in the glass. A mocha to straight brown head builds low on only a moderate pour. A creamy ring leaves temporary sheets on the glass, but the lacing doesn't sustain. The ring does, however, keeping me company down the glass.  The barrel has a nice presence, a little more of the spirit, really. The barrel seems to quell some of the char I seem to recall from the base beer, and definitely doesn't have as big an umami presence. It is replaced with more mellow freshly burnt wood and cocoa aromas.  Near full feeling, mainly due to the expanding warming presence of the bourbon spirit up front. Creamy when more chilled, more smooth as it warms. The barrel is forward, but the base beer sneaks its way back into the picture. There's a bitter dark chocolate note during the transition, then the dark coffee and light char finally grab hold for the end of the taste. As the beer nears room temperature, the opening barrel notes mellow a bit and a little bit of a licorice bite feeds into the dark chocolate middle.  The regular beer is one that can be aged easily, I have found from other people and my own experience. I'd think this beer would also take some age, perhaps a little less than the base so as to maintain a decent barrel presence, but allow some of the spirit to integrate a little earlier in the taste. But what do I know? I might just have to prove it to myself.",0.6495352645811773,4.25,0.9614
Swish,"Finally made it up to Portland for some Swish and am NOT disappointed! Phenomenal beer. My sinuses are terrible in the winter and the citrus just punched right through to me.

Dragonsaddle,"12 oz can poured into snifter canned on 11/15  A: nice caramel color with superb clarity with a small white creamy looking head that looks like it laces very well   S: lots of pineapple herbal, stone fruit almost like overripe melons   T: mango,melon, pineapple with touches of resin and some light herbal taste almost no malts in this one just pure hops not very bitter for a Triple IPA  M: medium body on it but it has such a creamy texture for an IPA but it does not linger a lot on the tongue very clean though  O: This beer explodes with juicy fruit flavors but has such a dynamite body with the creamy body. You would never guess this was a Triple IPA it is not hardly bitter at all it drinks like a DIPA and the alcohol which is huge is completely hidden.",0.6747155564357885,4.25,0.9614
Black Tuesday,"2013 bottle. A 19% stout sounds fun, but I found Black Tuesday borderline undrinkable after even two or three sips. Unless you have a high tolerance for extreme sweetness, I would only recommend opening it in a group of at least four people. For me, it felt like a stunt beer, and was much less enjoyable than the Bourbon Counties and Parabolas of the world.",0.5906036700039512,2.5,0.9613
Haze,"L - hazy - as advertised. good lacing on the glass, lighter towards the top and grows deeper in the snifter. S- wonderful. papaya, mango, tropical, very very strong nose. T - the beer does not sip as strong fruity forward as the smell as the bite at the end is bitter and lingers. Lots of resiny earthy pine in the finish that lingers long. almost so much so that it overpowers everything else though the more you drink it the more the other notes come off the sidelines and take hold.  F - does not feel like 8.2 at all, light, fluffy. very good here. O - this is my first crack at tree house and it is very very good. almost a jeckyl and hyde type situation where the smell is so citrus and the finish is so earthy dank but they pull it together nicely. the more you sip it the more you get from it too. great stuff.",0.6641761691724677,4.25,0.9613
Vicinity,"Poured from a 16oz can into my Stella Artois chalice (it was clean!) Looks like cloudy juicy goodness. It almost glows. Nose is grassy & lemony. I've let it warm a bit before diving in, so was kind of hoping for more from this DIPA. Taste is the juice bomb it appears to be. I am not getting big tropical anything, More citrussy. But really very good. Finish is crisp, and remarkably smooth.  Overall, this is a superb beer. I hope I get more of the tropical notes on the remaining beers in this 4-pack, but 8% was never more crushable.",0.6772980498065418,4.5,0.9612
Enjoy By IPA,"This beer's color absolutely radiates gold with a big foamy head, an absolutely gorgeous pour. Aroma is upbeat and citrusy, but nothing truly of note. Taste is smooth, dank but sweet with the expected hops bite. The big ABV and malt keep it mostly sweet at the back end of a swallow. Mouthfeel, again, is incredibly smooth. Delicious, but maybe a little too rich for more than one or two a sitting.",0.6980448086847078,4.5,0.9612
Chocolate Rain,"750mL bottle courtesy of Shane! Thanks. Split 3 ways. Consumed 9-3, reviewed from notes.  A: Sludge and tar. Heavy pour yields a very thin mocha lacing which will quickly dissipate. Not as viscous in the glass as it first appears.  N: Tons of prune and bourbon. Fudge and soy sauce. The promised vanilla is plenty obvious, and there's a very good similarity to blackberry brandy.  T: Very much like a port heavily laden with chocolate and cherries. Snapping vanilla and rough dark chocolate similar to mocha powder. Prune and some more of the blackberry brandy. Huge alcohol presence. And oh yes, chocolate deserves another mention.  M: Drying and thick. The drying aspect is somewhat unique as its similar to the way baker's chocolate scrapes your mouth clean. Don't find this terribly successful.  O: Very glad to try this. Was very intense, but I feel like it could benefit from some more body and less chocolate. And this is coming from someone who's a bit of a choco-nut.",0.624031185674072,3.5,0.9612
Madagascar,"Was really excited to get to try this new batch. Bought several bottles of this and boy am I glad that I did.   22oz bottle poured into a Jester King Teku  A - Shiny black color, minimal white/tan foam head, minimal to media lacing, good ring retention   S - Huge vanilla nose upfront followed by milky chocolate and hints of coffee and bourbon on the back end. Really decadent vanilla and chocolate though  T - Taste follows the nose here, huge amount of vanilla chocolate and coffee up front, highly drinkable with a touch of bourbon on the back end. The 9+% makes this relatively easy to drink and crushable. Vanilla is definitely the dominating taste here.   M - Mouthfeel is actually pretty full, smooth creamy light mouthfeel that drinks smooth  O - 4 Hands hit a homer with this beer. Really nailed what a vanilla stout can be, there aren't too many vanilla BA stouts out there that go toe to toe with this one, looking at you 2010 BCBVS. Cant wait to do a side by side with this and 2014 Vanilla Rye",0.6334353009687196,4.75,0.9612
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"750 ml bottle. Bottled in April 2010. Pours a dark red with small white head that has decent retention and leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass. Aroma is huge cherry, some cherry pits, some lactic acid, light barnyard funkiness, and just the smallest hint of acetic acid. Awesome. The taste is again huge with cherry flavor without sweetness, cherry pits, a decent amount of sourness, with a good lactic tartness on the finish. Medium body. Low carbonation. I found the carbonation to be a bit low and felt the beer would have definitely benefited from more carbonation. Still a phenomenal beer. It reminded me a lot of the fresh Lou Pepe Kriek I had on tap a few weeks ago. I found the Lou Pepe to be slightly more enjoyable, but certainly loved this as well.",0.6462354286934225,4.5,0.9612
Todd The Axe Man,"Pour: On draft at Smoke and Barrel in D.C. Poured into a tulip glass. Appearance: Light gold to orange in color. White head present on the pour but reduces to virtually nil after settling. Lacing present on the sides of the glass. Some lazy bubbles rising to the top. Hazy look to it. Aroma: Dank and juicy hop profile...citrus and grapefruit. Huge nose that doesn't half step. Taste: Follows the nose. huge dank and juicy on the palette. Citrus all the way. Also reveals notes of grass and pine. Aftertaste: Finishes juicy and somewhat chewy. Lots of citrus, earth and pine on the back end. Very consistent throughout. Notes: Love Surly.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"KBBS '14 (gold wax/label). Big thanks to @newbeeraday for sharing this bad boy!  A: Thick black pour reluctantly leaves the bottle and delivers a quickly receding mocha head. After a few moments, only wispy small bubbles remain, clinging the rim. Very oily legs effortlessly paint the glass.  S: Coffee, roasted malt, sweet maple. Burnt sugar. Some type of spice--maybe cumin? Tobacco, rye whiskey.   T: Sweet maple up front, roasty coffee in the middle and a lingering sweetened French vanilla coffee tail with a rye/bourbon boozy burn. Ms. Butterwoth's pillow after the Kentucky derby. Surprised at the nice retention of bourbon after many months since the release. [side note: tried this with VBDL '14 and by contrast KBBS tasted bitter and darker].  M: Fluffy pillow of velvet. Thick, rich, nicely carbed. Burn down the throat. Pretty much perfect for the style.  O: Well, it's a great beer. No doubt about that.",0.6195130572065888,5.0,0.9612

Juicy," 3 shared on 3-4-16. Pours on the darker side of yellow. Pretty hazy. Juicy is a great description of the beer overall, because that is what I got from nose to finish.

Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,"Brilliant copper amber body, clear with some haze from the chill. Three finger white, creamy head with some serious staying power. Nice sticky, web-like lace. Fresh pine and compost in the aroma mingles with tropical fruit, which comes more alive as it warms. The malts are wonderfully bready with a touch of honey. The taste is complex yet balanced. Tropical fruit juices, pineapple, mangos and papaya. Citrus rind and herbal hops towards the middle with a wonderful piney spice at the end. A touch grainy but mostly bready malts. Hints of honey sweetness throughout.  Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Resin like mouth feel but not too heavy. Lovely dry finish with a bite from the alcohol.  Perfect balance between the malt and the hops. Hop profile very balanced for such an aggressive beer.",0.7217046729585802,4.5,0.9612

F: very smooth for 20%. The heat is there but is a easy drink. Nice warming feeling. Would be great on a snow day.  O: lucky to get 3 bottles in 2015. My first time tasting it and it was a good showing. Not quite sure if the real thing met the hype but a phenomenal beer. I did expect just a little more. Maybe a creamier mouth feel.,0.6055441004934259,4.5,0.961
Peche 'n Brett,"Bottle No. P3746 (from the January 2013 IIRC, celleared upon release). Poured into my large St. Feuillien goblet, Peche 'n Brett is chill hazed burnt gold with a creamy, tight bubbled white head leaving sheets of foamy lace.   Smell is gorgeously soft, sweet peaches and pear nectar. The brett flutters through the fruit oh so subtly, adding just a touch of depth. Really fantastic.   Taste is also soft, the peach evident yet softened by the drying brett, which is really rather clean, while still making it's presence known. Perhaps just a touch understated, but the delicate nuance really adds the drinkability.   Mouthfeel is soft and dry, with fine carbonation.   Drinkability is high, it's really hard to believe this is 10% ABV. Not to mention how subtle the brett and sweetness from the fruits are, no palate wrecker here, just extremely balanced. What an elegant beer, fantastic.",0.6907097605834526,4.75,0.9609
Swish,"Can date hard to read, looks like May 7. Poured into Teku glass.  L: 1F+ head with poor retention, leaves no lacing and only a thin ring. Beer is a super-hazy golden yellow, like pineapple juice.  S: Wow. Just a dream of pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine, and slight earthy dankness. Total juicebomb.   T: Follows nose beautifully. Lots of grapefruit, tangerine, and pineapple to a lesser extent. Light malts and flaked wheat provide some good body. Finish is slightly earthy and quite neutral.  F: Medium bodied, fairly actively carbonated. Construction is supreme, balance exquisite. Drinks like ABV is half of its 8%.  O: Well, that's just incredible. Glad I was able to make the trade for one.",0.6873333120685248,4.5,0.9609

Chocolate Rain,"Leftovers of a bottle saved from the previous night, poured in a Bruery tulip. Dark brown, delicious and cohesive aroma of bourbon, raisins, a moderate dose of dark chocolate, and something herbaceous, almost minty. Sweet and moderately boozy on the palate, with rich dark fruit like raisins and figs, dark brown sugar, bourbon, super smooth and tasty.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"KBBS Vintage 2014 (x2)  Simply amazing! Poured from a 12 oz Vintage 2014 bottle into a small tasting glass (Thanks to the generosity of Mike & Clark for the first sample and Brandon for the second!) The smell was out of this world; coffee, maple, vanilla, roasted malt, slight bourbon and oak. Appeared very dark almost black with a dark tan head, very thick. The taste followed the nose and was unlike anything I've ever tried before. I was completely blown away by this stout, it surpassed the hype in my opinion. I found myself waiting about 2 minutes between drinks, leaving enough time for the taste to linger and to again smell the stout. Taste amplified over the first 30 seconds and the maple became stronger. Overall extremely impressed with this release from Toppling Goliath! I just wish it were more readily available as it is almost impossible to find. 5/5",0.6185684375566212,5.0,0.9608
Black Tuesday,"2015 vintage. Drunk Feb2017.  Look was very dark, practically no head. Wonderful aroma of dark fruit, chocolate, and barrel characteristics. Was expecting some alcohol heat to be evident on the nose but it was surprisingly masked well. Can say the same thing about the taste. Expected this to be hot as hell on the alcohol heat due to the high abv (even with 2 yrs on it), but it was a sweet dark fruit-covered chocolates and bourbon flavor. Impressed! Mouthfeel was a bit thin, a little oily, but still had some minor thickness. Overall, I was very impressed and full enjoyed the taste and aroma on this. I wonder what even more aging would do to this. Worth my time!",0.6642058739389526,5.0,0.9608
Nelson,"Poured from 22oz bottle into a dimpled mug.  Appearance: light golden-yellow hue with a moderate haze and a finger of frothy white foam that lasts a decent interval. Attractive!  Smell: brightly piney and grapefruity hops with a nice toasty base. The rye and the prickly hop elements work very well together indeed.  Taste: much like the aroma, pine, grapefruit and maybe a little tangerine are the prominent hop flavors, and the rye adds a bready touch to the finish. What a wonderful beer.  Mouthfeel: medium body with a decent carbonation and an OK creaminess. I don't think you drink Nelson for its texture, though.  Overall: I could see myself drinking a ton of this stuff.",0.6754145996445436,4.25,0.9608
Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Poured a slightly hazy bright yellow with a fluffy, beautiful white head. Aromas of lemon, funk, citrus zest, and buckwheat meld perfectly together. A really excellent saison with a perfect, lingering finish.",0.6787127036420886,4.5,0.9608
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Being completely honest, I'm being generous with my numbers above owing to the beer's reputation and my own style preferences and biases. I used to love wheat beers before my IPA and imperial stout days; now, everything else seems to fall short. Additionally, I drank this particular beer immediately after Stone Enjoy By DIPA, which provided a more immediate contrast. It was beautiful to look at - cloudy and golden with a huge head with good retention and lots of bubbles rising. Aroma is of funky overripe banana, wheat, yeast, lemon, spice. Taste is similar and very wheaty. A tiny bit of sweetness, sourness, and bitterness all balanced together all the way through the finish. There was also a note of artificial lemon juice that I did not enjoy.  I appreciate that it is well crafted but it is not my cup of tea these days so maybe I shouldn't be reviewing it in the first place. I do recommend it highly to anyone who enjoys wheaty beers.",0.6823948874968364,3.5,0.9607
Enjoy By IPA,"Finding Enjoy By 04.20 on tap mid-March, bought a bunch of cans and still enjoying on 04.10: still dank, beautiful citrusy, complex and awesome.  Agree with Brew Killer review: “exceptional in every way...” .  A truly world class, wonderful IIPA",0.6247336486522233,4.75,0.9607
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Bottle shared at RBSG 2012 Grand Tasting. I don’t even know what to say about this beer. It’s a whole new level for imperial stouts that I didn’t know existed. All those other reviews of other imperial stouts that talk about ""fudge"" and ""brownies"" and ""roasted coffee"" and ""barrel notes"" may as well be talking about dog food. This beer is so vivid, so delicious, it’s like brownie concentrate with caramel, nuts, syrup. Body is full and soft, unlike the oily chore that is regular Dark Lord. It’s definitely really really sweet, but in sample size it’s unparalleled. Maybe the biggest highlight of a great night.",0.6281876538373073,5.0,0.9607
Nectarine Premiere,This is a wow drank on draft and from a bottle. A glass of ripe nectarines. Appearance is hazy like fruit puree. Aroma and taste is straight up nectarines with a touch of apricots. Sweet and tart just like your favorite stone fruit. Overall perfection.,0.6465389010262332,5.0,0.9607
Sip Of Sunshine,"Dated 1/30/17. 12 days old.  Clear golden/light amber in the glass. Two fingers of rocky off white head. Big juicy tropical fruit forward nose, followed by a bucketful of hops, sweet dankness, resin, florals and pale malt. Bitter yellow grapefruit up front to let you know who's boss with a wonderful balance of all the notes from the nose. Above average carbonation with a medium body that leaves a great oily coating in your mouth. Wonderful extra dry, bitter aftertaste that doesn't linger too long. Definitely the best East meets West IPA I've ever tried.",0.6568631254339472,4.5,0.9607
Swish,"Best beer I have had. Was fortunate enough to have Julius, double dry hopped Scaled, Roosevelt, and Swish this last week. Swish has the best balance of smell, juicy citrusy hoppy taste with just enough bitterness to remind you it's an IPA and the trademark New England hazy OJ look. Love this beer. Perhaps my all time favorite. Thanks BB.",0.6140194191583859,4.75,0.9607
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"500 ml. bottle poured into a 20 oz. mug. A gentle pour creates a finger thick eggshell white long lasting head.  Large and small bubbles shrink to a creamy foam. No lacing yet it has ""legs"". Vintage maple or orange-pineapple juice colour, hazy and opaque.  Smells of yeasty sourdough bread, banana, fruit cocktail with a faint must. Sweet malt, banana, slightly sour apple juice and peppery hops control the taste- in that order. Medium to rich oily body with lots of CO2. Great balance between sweet, a little sour and bitter hops.  Centuries "" spelled correctly this time"" of practice have paid off. I tried this beer's Dunkel cousin, I don't have a favorite as both are outstanding and suprisingly different. This verion has more pronounced fruit flavors, might be a better choice for the upcomming heat wave.",0.6719683625684294,4.5,0.9606
Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,This beer is nearly perfect. Excellent IPA. It has a very smooth almost gentle finish compared to some other IPAs. Golden Amber in color. It has a great head on the pour. Quite excellent,0.662783319472051,4.75,0.9605
Sip Of Sunshine,"I have been trying to get this beer for awhile and all of a Sudden it popped up ""everywhere""in CT. It looks like they have teamed up with two roads to do some of there brewing down there.  This beer is as good as advertised. I don't have the palette like some of the other reviewers but this beer is delicious.  The only small negative is the alcohol bite you get at the end but that's what you get for an 8%. I read somewhere below that this great beer maybe better served at the 6.5% and I actually agree with that.",0.5671539520757579,4.75,0.9605
Sip Of Sunshine,"I avoided this for the last few months while Lawson sorted out their non juicy hop issue. Since I missed out on my weekly Treehouse alottment last week due to the new brewery drawing huge crowds, I figured I'd try Sip again. Wow am I glad I did! They are back and better than ever. If you are seeking a true New England IPA and your standards are very high this one's for you. It is a juicy hop bomb from the 1st sip to the last. I poured into a tulip so I could enjoy that beautiful tropical smell. There isn't one hint of the 8% abv. In summary, it's perfect, the smell and taste are incredible...and this is from a guy who compares everything now to Treehouse",0.5763093445690305,4.75,0.9605
Beer:Barrel:Time,"Amazing barrel forward stout. Smells like vanilla wafers and charred oak and dark caramel. Baffling complexity combined with sufficient sweetness. And while the booze is currently still fairly intense, I can see this aging beautifully. Mouthfeel was full but as usual is the case in any non-TG beer, I wouldn't have minded a bit more substance there. Altogether of the best barrel aged beers I've ever tasted and perhaps (surprisingly) i enjoyed it even more than any of the Derivations I've had.",0.7126268269971547,4.75,0.9604
Todd The Axe Man,"Poured from a can dated 7/05/19 into the test glass. A - late season sunflower color, a touch of haze, gently carbonated. A loose white froth caps the experience. S - Pineapple, papaya, a touch of spice, medium roast malts, some orange peel as well. T - Follows the nose well, with great definition on the palate. M - A bit slick, medium in body, with a sweet wave that runs amock. Finish is sweet and lingering around are the fruits as mentioned. O - A very good IPA, worth the accolades the offering has earned",0.6510775292619273,4.25,0.9604
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,Side by side with 2016 Expedition. Thanks Dave and Jon! Great oak character. I'm a huge fan of Expedition Stout and the base beer shines through so well. Lots of barrel flavor. Absolutely delicious.,0.5807650194774656,4.5,0.9603
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"Black with a brown biscotti looking head that dissipates moderately fast. Super chocolate nose, super chocolate taste with a dark chocolate cherry cordial background flavor. Little bit of coffee and roasty malts as well. This is the most chocolaty stout I've had yet. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but overall great chocolate stout. Nice job Nate!!",0.6582553344810638,4.5,0.9603
Enjoy By IPA,"Indulged in the 7/4/19 edition with the patriotic red, white, and blue can.   Look: Urine; lighter than amber. Creamy and persistent lace head.   Smell: My sense of smell isn’t that developed, but I get a lot of mango and papaya.  Taste: Mango, pinneapple, and papaya give way to cantaloupe and honeydew melon. The fruit flavors linger through an emerging mild, piney, hop bitterness. The whole thing is incredibly balanced and smooth for a 9.4% beer that drinks more like a 6 or 7%.  Feel: Mouthfeel is light to moderate. Smooth and drinkable, not too resiney. Fresh, refreshing, and good for a hot summer day without being too light for a beer of this genre.   Overall, a very strong beer; better than the Great Lakes Lake Erie Monster, but a hair behind the Columbus Brewing Bodhi in my opinion, both of which I also sampled this weekend.",0.6951748648293793,4.25,0.9603
Madagascar,"2014 bottle. Subtle vanilla flavor compared to vanilla rye, which some may like, but I enjoy a sweet, in your face vanilla stout. Still, it's a very good beer. Looking forward to trying 2015 fresh",0.6452972186251582,4.25,0.9603
Black Tuesday,"First actual review, and it will be brief. Blame TMTOBA.  750ml bottle, 2012, served in a snifter.  A: black and thick. Not super thick or syrupy.   S: bourbon, burnt sugar, chocolate.   T: bourbon/booze but not overbearing for 19%. Burnt sugar coated raisins (light raisin taste) mix with chocolate and a dash of vanilla.  M: not super thick, but definitely sticks a bit. Feels a bit hot, and should be sipped. Swig at your own discretion.  O: I'll be honest, initially I was thinking not the best. About 2 sips later it improved. The further I got into this baby, the more I appreciated it. For a super boozy beer, this is top notch. You will definitely notice/taste/smell the booze, but for 19% or so, I think it blends VERY well. The more I think on this beer, and miss the flavor, the more I admire it. Definitely share a bottle with 2-3 others (even if I did not do the same...yikes).",0.6000935449890878,4.5,0.9603
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Serving: Can Canned: Feb-13-2018   A: Pours a murky rotten mango color with a finger of short-lived soapy head. Middlin' retention; barely-there lacing. (3.75)  S: Really interesting hop aroma. Vanilla, imitation mango, moss, olives (!?), herbs. Something incredibly vivid that I can't quite place. (4.5)  T: Dry, powdery suggestion of bitterness with melon, guava, mango, citrus zest. (4.25)  M: Soft, medium body with medium carbonation and a crisp, dry finish. (4.5)  O: This is a weird one (and I mean that in the best possible way). It had been a while since a Trillium beer had that ""wow"" moment like the first time, but this one did. It pours all right looking and is otherwise very good. Juicy, woodsy, fresh bitterness in the flavor and a fluffy/dry feel. The real star for me is the aroma but mainly because it reminds me of something from my childhood (like eerily so) and I can't quite place it. Like an Orange Julius or some sort of mango-coconut kind of smell. Really nice, creamy and fruity. Great beer.  Danke, J-Dawg! (4.5)",0.6762702396955887,4.5,0.9602
Sip Of Sunshine,Absolutely the best new beer I've tried all year! I love high resin IPA so I thought I'd be let down by this fruit forward New England style IPA but I wasn't. It was crisp and refreshing and went down so smooth it is dangerous given the high ABV.  This is what an IPA is all about ... I see what the hype is all about. I do love the fact you can also find this at a lot of places unlike other cult craft beers. Maybe because I live in CT.  Overall you cannot go wrong with this. It packs a punch and tastes good. What more could you ask for? The only downside is that the can looks super cheesy in the way that someone from the 90s would have a sun tattoo and listen to DMB.,0.5928260516097674,5.0,0.9602
Todd The Axe Man,"Great citrus and floral nose. Pours coppery haze with substantial head and lacing. Hop nose is decidely tropical. The taste is world-class IPA. Not too murky, not too bittter, hop flavors are showcased with clean, supporting malt not getting in the way. Great combination of old school and new school IPA. Very drinkable American IPA - as good as the style gets. Not too over the top, with a juicy hop profile that's second to none.",0.6610331171301151,4.5,0.9601
Space Trace,"Pours black with tiny tan head (duh). Smells of coconut and caramel. Taste starts with huge tropical coconut followed by that marshmallow bottle logic stout taste, ends with some big oak/bourbon barrel. Mouthfeel is a typical barrel aged stout, wish it was a 15%er but that's just me (11-12% will just be fine). The b st aspect of this beer is the taste. Probably the best BA coconut stout I have had. Coconut is big, but doesn't overshadow bottle logic's amazing stout game, all about that marshmallow notes",0.6225513242270522,4.75,0.9601
Swish,"Pours golden yellow with strong carbonation and a one finger head. Smell is of sticky hop aroma, sweet malts, pineapple and grapefruit citrus. Taste is a citrus wave, with crisp hops, biscuity malts -- with solid bitterness through. Some sweetness stands out as the beer warms up. Still hop forward. Finishes dry and bitter, with a sweet lacing. Overall - really great IPA out of Maine. There's some stiff competition and this beer has to be mentioned when discussing the best.",0.6789783334713375,4.5,0.9601
Todd The Axe Man,"Thanks to umichfan for this beer. Poured from the can.   This was a nice departure from all of the NE IPAs I've been drinking recently. It has a really solid malt profile which helps give the beer a larger body than you'd expect from the nose. Aroma is grapefruit and some faint pine resin in the back, with the barley showing up as you pull away. Has a pretty heavy mouthfeel for the style, and there is definitely a boozy kick at the end of each sip.   Overall I enjoyed this beer. Pretty heavy hitting, even if the ABV is on-par with some other easier drinking brews in the same style. Maybe not something I'd drink one after another, but definitely a treat once in awhile.",0.6346880036294247,4.0,0.9601
Peche 'n Brett,Bottle: Poured a hazy orangey/golden color ale with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of light tart notes with funky yeast notes and fresh peach notes is quite awesome. Taste is a great mix between some peach notes with loads of tart notes with light acidic flavours and some funky yeast notes also noticeable. Body is full with limited filtration and good carbonation. Best peach beer I have ever had with lots of dominating flavours and nice balance between the funky and tart flavours.,0.6999687914958901,4.5,0.9601
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Red label 2003 bottle shared by Denise for our Memorial Day sour tasting. Thanks!  Incredible aroma: sour, funky, tart, acidic, citrusy. Each freely billowed up from the glass to massage my nasal cavities. Taste balances everything well with a crisp, clean citrusy finish. Tons of depth that I'd never really experienced in a gueuze before.  I enjoyed this more than any of the Armand'4 bottles we opened immediately prior. This one aged quite well; wish we had another bottle.",0.6783990146866773,4.5,0.96
Todd The Axe Man,"Poured from a 16oz can with a canned on date of 9/21/17;into a tulip (as recommended on the can). Appearance- hazy orange with some noticeable sediment and a powerful storm of carbonation bubbles that sustains a soapy white head. Lacing is decent! Smell - citrus fruit, grass, pine and a touch of sweet malt! Taste - the citrus is definitely there, but there's a sneaky touch of pineapple too; the grass, pine and malt sweetness pair so well together! Feel - this feels a lot like Lagunitas Sucks to me; hop dominant but just the right amount of sweet malt backing! Overall- I'm getting this in Denver during GABF, so I'm sure the price is higher here than what it typically is in the Midwest, but hovering around $20/4 pack pints is awfully high for a regular IPA; however, you get what you pay for and this is an absolutely stellar beer!",0.6655381102716743,4.25,0.96
Mastermind,Bottle: Poured a pale yellow color ale with a generous pure white foamy head with excellent retention and good amount of lacing. Aroma of fresh juicy hops with nice grapefruit and tropical notes. Taste is also dominated by loads of juicy hops notes with fresh tropical fruit notes as well as some grapefruit. Body is light with good carbonation. World-class IIPA indeed with almost no bitterness and loads of fresh hops juice.,0.6847779974016635,4.0,0.96
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2014 vintage at the brewery.  Pours a deep red, with fine foam.  Smell has a crazy amount of raspberries, complimented by a little bit of funk and some elderflower.  Taste is moderately sour, but sooo refreshing and fruity. Raspberries, some lime and a bit of hay are the main notes, and it's so deep and complex. The flavors just keep evolving as it warms. Awesome stuff!  Mouthfeel is thin and prickly.  Overall, an amazing fruit lambic, so complex and enjoyable.",0.7304727251407861,4.75,0.96
Green,"Canned yesterday  A: poured into a tulip to a deep yellowish orange that is hazy as all hell and topped by a dense two finger white head that has good retention and lacing S: Smells of oily and juicy citrus hop notes with a little tropical fruit and pineapple. T: Taste is juicy hops with citrus, some herbal notes and tropical fruit with some hints of pineapple. Slight malt sweetness but mostly just fresh and juicy hops. Swallow is more juicy citrus and tropical fruits with some slight lingering herbal bitterness balanced by slight malty sweetness M: This beer has a moderate mouthfeel with a creamy texture. Decent carbonation is just under prickly. The swallow on the beer is oily and resinous so it coats the mouth well. O: Overall this is a tasty beer. Definitely different from what I am used to with some very nice and bright hop notes. It seems to represent the style well but I think there are some better IPAs out there. Tree House has a lot of hype behind them but hype is not a flavor note.",0.6839895512492729,4.5,0.9599
Juicy,"This beer has been rated and reviewed endlessly so I will only note a few surprises. I came into this not having read reviews, only knowing it had a somewhat legendary status. From what I'd heard, I expected more hops, a lighter beer, more pure fruitiness. What I got was something less extreme, less one dimensional, better to my tastes. There is a ton of oak. That was surprise one. Big oaky notes. Buttery. No vanilla or tannic elements, just woodiness. Love it. Surprise two was the body; this has heft, girth, thickness for a wine ba wild ale / saison. Carbonation is a bit muted but that just enhances it's heft. The name juicy didn't conjure that for me. The darkness of the beer was surprise three; had the auburn tones that one might expect of a biere de garde (without the abundant head). Acidity is mild, perfect for the richer body.   This is less a summation and more an observation of facets. A beer I would love to drink over and over again. Sadly, probably not gonna happen.",0.67765921053901,4.5,0.9599
Chocolate Rain,"2012 bottle crushed druing Sugar Bowl hope solo  A- Rather transparent for a BA stout, especially with this amount of ABV. Little to no head. Thin lacing around the bottle.   S- Big bourbon upfront. Chocolate malty in back. Dates perhaps raisin thin in back.  T- Rich chocolate bourbon. Very smooth. This is for the sweet beer lovers. Probably wouldn't work if you are a die hard strict RIS fan.   M- Pretty smooth, with some carbonation going down the throat. Kinda thin. Surprised by that. I have had this many times, and I don't remember it being this thin.   O- I think?? a well crafted beer by The Bruery. It seems their most popular beers have to have a sweet factor.",0.6240573406563256,4.25,0.9599
Sure Bet,"Between MN distribution & a good trading partner, I’m rapidly becoming a huge Pipeworks fan. This is the latest 22 oz. bomber to show up in the Land of 10,000 Lakes. Split with my wife.   The pour is light-skinned peach with virtually no head. The nose, is mango & sugar & citrus, oh my. Supremely sweet up front; let’s see how that carries over.   Sure Bet states it contains mango puree, but it might BE mango puree. Ever sat underneath a mango tree with mango syrup streaming into your mouth? It’s like that, only the tree, ground, & air are all mango too. Might be a mango too far. Additionally, there’s mouth-rending pure sugar (the honey, I presume), citrus, & low level of bitterness playing hide-and-seek with my tongue. Thick. My sweet tooth says “this is easy to drink”.   Too crazy sweet & too crazy mango – not even sure the base is beer. Pretty good brew.",0.6251391029390504,4.0,0.9599
Sure Bet,"Big Thanks to @Kevinpitts for this beauty!!!  Pours a hazy swirl of orange.  Smell is tropical, zesty mango, hint of orange, and some bitter, resiny love. Taste is amazing. Juicy mango, peach, bitter, resiny, and yet sweet malty backbone. Lord, my pants are wet. Finish is hops with mango juice, going toward orange and pineapple. Every sip brings more heaven.  Overall, stunningly deliscious.",0.6178219005823158,4.5,0.9599
Scaled Up,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into a pint glass. Thanks Steve for giving me this.   Pours a pretty hazy body with a big white frothy head that reduces slowly to leave heavy blotchy lacing and chunky retention, looks really nice.   Aromas are very dank and citrusy, floral, grapefruit. On the tongue is crisp citrus and grapefruit, followed by some resinous dank notes, slight pine, finishes with a light bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium body and medium carbonation.   A really nice DIPA. Super flavorful and balanced, on the citrusy / floral side. Enjoyed.",0.6961127993953093,4.5,0.9598

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Thanks to mcj6986 for this 375ML bottle (2016). I loved the base beer, so I was jazzed to see this come up on in the trading scrum for less than 3x VR.   The pour is blacker than Wormtongue’s soul, may he rest in peace. Evident carbonation is minimal, with scarcely a hiss on popping & only the rumor of bubbles breaking up the gloomy surface. Smells like Christmas cookies with a little bourbon pop from your uncle pouring a double a few feet away. I’m not disappointed.   Oro Negro – Bourbon Barrel Aged brings me home like a Heather Brooke video. A bit more heat than the base, perhaps because it’s fresher, & the cinnamon is correspondingly meeker. The bourbon is in your face – if your face were across the room & down the stairs, more of a finish in the back of the throat (hahaha!) & a pleasant numbing sensation than a taste. Subtle. Chocolate is about buried, vanilla ghostly, no nuts, as the heat builds with each sip. Thick, but this bottle is going to take some effort to get through.   This needs some time. The heat obliterates some of the base beer’s lovely qualities, & the bourbon is detectable only after cleaning out the Augean Stables. I was really looking forward to this, & it was a letdown. I’ll revisit my other bottle in a few months, hoping the habaneros have dulled & let the rest of the beer breathe a bit. A very good beer, but...",0.6053641333963921,3.5,0.9596

Nelson,pours light golden with minimal head that dissipates quickly. smell of nelson suavin all the way I can't seem to place what im smelling w this hop. maybe some floral notes and lemon? anyway smells pretty nice. taste follows nose w the hop presenting itself from front pallate all the way to the end. rye gives this beer a nice spice at the finish with bitterness lingering. this is a great beer and I love nelson hops even though I can't quite place what im tasteing. seek out this one it's a def winner.,0.6107105187493119,4.5,0.9595
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Picked this beer up on the fly and really was happy I did. Colour is brilliant cloudy yellow with light carbonation and really thick cream that keeps its volume.

Mastermind,"I had this fresh and from a growler after it had sat for 2 weeks. It was a little better fresh - but when fresh had a really strong licorice flavor. After it waited a bit, it seems to mute the licorice that I remember (there was still some for sure though), which let some hop and other cirtrus/pineapple flavor through. Very good DIPA.",0.6217511647629324,4.5,0.9594
Sure Bet,"This is an amazing beer. Cloudy hazy orange colored pour. Nice head. The aroma is off the charts, the mango! Taste is incredible, similar to grouper with a hint of mango. Mango isn't as strong on the taste as the aroma. Overall one of the best IPA's I've ever tasted.  This is one to be enjoyed super fresh!",0.6679965732245634,4.75,0.9594
Green,A: Beer pours a hazy yellowish orange body. Strong pour gave a solid two fingers' worth of white head. Lots of lacing left behind on the side of the glass while drinking.   S: Lots of tropical fruitiness here on the beer. Big amounts of pineapple and orange notes coming from the nose. The aromas from this beer are top notch. Big tropical sweet aromas all over the place.   T: Flavors are very similar to the nose. Lots of tropical fruit flavors on this beer. Grapefruit and pineapples stand out over other fruit tastes. Beer is very creamy tasting also.   M: Very soft and creamy mouthfeel. Almost no clesr amount of alchol on the feel of the beer; very well hidden. Very smooth and easy drinker. I imagine this is something I could drink a large amount of fairly quickly.   O: Outstanding beer. Big tropical feel all over the place. Almost no noticeable amount of alcohol. Easily one of the best IPAs of this style I have drank.,0.6649975210682173,4.75,0.9594
Peche 'n Brett,"Yields a clouded amber-yellow color with a decent sized head.   Lots of ripe, almost overripe peaches on the nose with an earthy quality and ice-tea sweet malts. A faint, funky, dusty sourness cuts through the prominent fruitiness, which reveals a luscious sweetness, reminding me of a peach jogurt.  Has a medium carbonation among a fuller body with a late dryness, coating up the sourness.   Drinks with a heavy, fermented fruitiness from the very beginning, complimented by sweet, cakey malts and a creamy softness. Has a jogurty sourness, which gets accompanied by a perfumy peach fruitiness throughout. Finish with more acidic jogurt, still soft on the tongue with even more perfumy peach.  Seems a bit unbalanced to me due to the overly artificial, perfume dominance, which is pretty intense on both aromas and flavors. Got a nice, well fitting tartness, which adds to the richness of the peaches. Unfortunately its pushing too far, adding a distractive artifical flavor to the taste.",0.6971555010024462,2.5,0.9594
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Exceceptionall beer had on tap at the Lion's Pride In Brunswick, ME.  A - Faded cherry head with a beautifull red 1 finger head poured into a glass.

Smell is pineapple, bright green freshly cut Christmas tree, orange, white pepper, and kiwi. It sounds like a strongly vibrant nose, but I think in this brew the aromas are subdued a touch, not sure why.  This one's really balanced yet flavorful, hitting tons of notes that include pineapple, orange sherbet, sweet vanilla, peach and orange, with a lot of same yeast spiciness found in some Hoof Hearted beers Ohio locals tend to complain about when ultra fresh. There is also a bitter but bright element, like lemon rind.  This is a super soft beer, like bubblegum juice, and it goes down all too quickly.",0.6687879688064161,4.0,0.9593
Sure Bet,Not sure when this was bottled but I poured into a tulip glass and got almost no head and minimal lacing.  The color was a nice apricot color. Got a nice tropical smell to it and would be happy to use as an air freshner. The mango scent lingered but was not overwhelming. Tasted like a decent IPA solid but not near the top of my list. Felt like there was bit of spice that lingered on my tongue for a few seconds.  This is solid Imperial IPA from a brewery that regularly puts out some of my favorite beers. This is a solid beer I would be happy to drink again but would not go out of my way to seek out.,0.6287284915002458,4.25,0.9592
Chocolate Rain,"Batch 2  Appearance: Very dark brown with a fairly small beige head which dissipated fairly quickly. Considerable legs on this one.  Smell: Upfront Bourbon, raisins, brown sugar, vanilla, chocolate/cocoa, and a bit of coffee/roasted malt aroma. Also a bit of ethanol in the nose.   Taste: Bourbon, raisins, vanilla, brown sugar, chocolate, and some coffee/roast malts appearing in the finish. There is an alcohol presence but no way is a beer that's 40 proof not going to have an alcohol presence. Nice barrel presence and flavor complexity.   Mouth-feel: Medium to full bodied. Some heat but good for it's alcohol level.  Overall: Good beer, which is quite a bit better closer to room temperature. My memory may not be accurate but I feel the cask version I had in 2010 and Batch 1 were a bit better than the batch 2 bottle being reviewed. Nonetheless, it's a big beer that's a stellar sipper.",0.6672329621319885,4.5,0.9592
Sang Noir,"Enjoyed at EBF 2014.  Pours a brownish body which sounds plain but is anything but. Strong blackberries, currants and cherries are accentuated in the flavor and the aroma very nicely.

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"This is the true definition of what a world class stout should be all about. I've had this 3 years in a row now at DLD and it never fail to impress and you will find me in the pub again and again on DLD. Pours a chocolate blackness and delivers everything you could imagine or ever dream of in a stout. Bourbon and oak seem to melt flawlessly into the background of this monster stout that does truly make this a treat to be savored. If there is a flaw it would be that it's not bottled and sold as a one bottle kicker on DLD along with it's standard version. Everything is here oak,vanilla,bourbon,chocolate fudge goodness.. the best way is fresh off the tap but to see this end up bottled would be awesome..Keep up the good work FFF's you started this whole craft beer craze and one off stout release everyone else is copying what FFF's started..the true kings of craft beer!",0.5998397750159159,5.0,0.959

All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"This is the good stuff. Tree House really knows there way around a stout. First time having this and it’s fantastic. Looks wise it’s more on par with HOTS or Somewhere Something: dark with a creamy, mocha head. The smell is great. A light roast coffee with loads of chocolate. Also getting some berry notes, maybe blackberry or raspberry. Flavor is even better. Tastes like someone blended coffee and some berries into a chocolate milk shake. It’s has such a creamy feel and taste. It somewhat reminds me of cheesecake oddly enough. Really digging this one and would say it’s in the upper echelon of stouts I’ve had.",0.6435930851277536,4.75,0.959

Double Orange Starfish,"Pours a golden hazy hue. Lots of citrusy aroma. Wow, this really delivers. A lot of galaxy beers have been over hopped and provide a hop burn that is unbecoming, but this greatly balances the hops. There's a beautiful minerality. It is citrus fruit heaven. I really enjoyed this.",0.673836060973814,4.5,0.9589
Haze,"Pours a creamy opaque light straw yellow with a whispy frothy white head. Nose is of citrus skin and light pine. Taste is a thing of beauty! A nice citrus punch in the mouth. Both peeland zest as well as juice of oranges, grapefruit and lemon. Nice malt backbone although minimal presence, you know its there because the hoppyness of this beer is perfectly balanced. Meadium creamy body. Smooth to drink. Finishes with with a Nice pungent citrus bitterness that leaves you craving the next sip to start the process over again.

Black Tuesday,"2014 release, 19.7% of DANG.  Smells like a rich, dark chocolate candy bar, dropped into a pan of hot chocolate pudding, quietly burning on the range. Complexity of this beer is off the charts. I have had several of The Bruery's blended beers that incorporate Black Tuesday, and I've had Grey Monday, but I will freely admit I was not expecting the zany flavors this monstrous brew delivered to me on the first sip. Abundant fig, oak, hazelnut, almond, vanilla, sweet cream, molasses, molten caramel, pudding, semisweet chocolate... I don't know, man. Blown away. Was all ready to be objective about it and then the first drop hit my tongue. BT is entirely worthy of the reputation it has garnered.",0.6194318491828779,4.75,0.9589
Society & Solitude #4,"Made a special trip to the Pony Bar on the Upper East Side so I wouldn’t miss the very brief NYC appearance of this beer. Other kegs seemed to kick in a single afternoon and this one wound up lasting less than a day so it seems I wasn’t alone. Simply put this is as good as any highly hopped beer I’ve ever had. I don’t know how to rank these beers anymore; it simply is a matter of what hop combination one prefers at any given time, because this one and things like Abner, Pliny, Double Sunshine, the best of Alpine, Heady, the best of Surly and Three Floyds, etc. are all just fantastic. Holy crap there are some terrific hoppy beers being brewed these days.  S & S #4 pours light hazed, apricot/gold; with a small, slowly settling head and nicely clinging lace. Super vivid hoppy aroma leaps from the glass, packing tons of tropical fruit, citrus, pine, and resinous notes. The flavor follows suit; there’s no maltiness muddling things up; just lots of tropical and citrus fruit, with lesser pine and floral notes bringing up the rear. Some very light fruity sweetness and a dry finish. Lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. The bitterness is assertive but doesn’t get in the way of the hop subtleties at all. Booze is totally masked.   Medium body, moderate carbonation; smooth and slightly creamy, drinks clean but leaves the hops lingering on your tongue for a long time. Bravo, extremely well done. What a beer.",0.6756960856227898,4.5,0.9589
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Poured out jet black, thin tan head on top settling into a ring around the glass. The smell is of molasses, not much coffee but it smells very good regardless. The taste is sweet again not a ton of coffee but definite chocolate in there with some caramel in there too. The feel is a little thinner than expected. Overall a very good stout.",0.6196547478050893,4.5,0.9589
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"This beer poured with virtually no head what so ever. It was probably served a little cold but I was probably the 10th person to get this so I'm guessing it was due to that.   The color of this brew was as dark as a beer could get, IMO. It coated the cup like the nastiest motor oil from the most run down POS you could imagine. (I still have the cup)   The smells was phenomenal. Smells of vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, chocolate cake, and a little burnt coffee made up this beast.   The taste simply cant be put into words but I will make a poor attempt at it. It was probably the most balanced beer I've ever had. At no point did this beer reveal any of its 13%. It was super creamy, Bourbon-y, and very chocolaty.   The mouth was so rich and creamy and thick and malty. I am honored to have tried this brew.   Overall, this beer is the best beer I've ever tried. It, IMO, can't get much better than this. I'm excited to see what can top it.",0.6176374474831384,5.0,0.9588
Very GGGreennn,"A - A bright milky orange body that is completely solid, white head with just a tinge of orange, and curtains of lacing. It looks the epitome of a NE IPA.  S - The smell is pungent fruit, mango and orange juice, orange cream soda, and a vanilla-banana note in the finish.  T - Joining the orange and mango notes from the nose are pineapple and peach come through in the taste. The close introduces a hint of grapefruit juice and mild pith elements that balances the slightly sweet open.  M - This lays down so softly, gently running across the tongue with a tingly hop resin feel that lands just right.  O - This is an extraordinary beer. Fundamentally the best IPA I have ever had. Superb.",0.6499193468779029,5.0,0.9588
Todd The Axe Man,"Pours a slightly hazed orange color with a small, soon vanishing white head.  Smells of cake coated citrus pulp, together with a subtle blueberry quality. Citrus fruits are dominating the nose in a pleasant way, getting depth from a pithy quality, as well as a flowery softness and dough. There is also a bright note of orange pulp atop the lemon, together with some old ginger, producing an awesomly well smelling beer.  Has a soft medium carbonation, perfectly illustrating the refreshing nature of this beer, while displaying a noteable flavor depth, featuring a solid, sweet malt balance. The beer stays soft on the tongue throughout, while its different flavors come together perfectly.  Tastes of an initial lime bitterness, which immediately gets coated by toffeeish, cakey malts, with the lemon regaining a flowery depth afterwards. The hops take a fruity turn then, revealing passion fruit and orange, which are tied to the omnipresent lemon all the time. Develops a powerful, bitter dryness during the finish, in which a herbal note adds to the hops, and the present malt backbone shrinks to a balancing minimum, providing a note of required dough.  This is an awesomly well made ipa. It is juicy, bitter and refreshing, while integrating a nowadays almost uncommon malt note. This maltiness really does enrich the hops though, which would be a little to harsh and one dimensionally straight forward on the palate otherwise.",0.7411602284722739,4.25,0.9588
Dragonsaddle,"Description: Clear and golden in color with just a bit of white head. The smell is initially a big blast of citrus fruit with some dank, pine and resin underneath. Taste is similar with pineapple, mango and a sweet, fruity taste up front. The finish has just enough bitterness to provide a good balance to the beer and leave a pleasant, slightly bitter aftertaste: alcohol is almost completely absent which is quite an accomplishment for an 11%+ ABV beer. The mouthfeel is thin and smooth with just a little carbonation.  Suggested food pairing: Pork...maybe grilled or roasted  If you like this beer then you should also try: Bodhi  Overall: 4.5 (This beer is very good and I would definitely drink it again) As some others posted, perhaps the most notable feature of this beer is that the alcohol is virtually non-existent. Well, I mean it tastes like it's not there. I certainly felt the alcohol about halfway into my drive home...not ideal. This is dangerously smooth and drinkable for a beer of this ABV. It's not a hopbomb like some triple IPAs, which is a good thing for me. I don't think I would put it in the very top rung of IPAs, but it's pretty close. If Hoof Hearted keeps at it I'm sure they'll be there soon.",0.6831035443153733,4.5,0.9588
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"750ml bottle ""2008 sticker"" bottled in 2010. I was a little uneasy with this bottle. It appeared that at some point the pressure must have really build up inside and leaked through both the cork and cap and ran down the side of the label. The cap pried off with a hiss and revealed a layering of beer atop the cork which was riddled with rust. The cork was so saturated that it dissolved/broke as I removed it. Fortunately, the bottom half of the cork formed a solid seal and loudly popped as it came out. Shared with some friends and split into matching Cantillon glasses, this brew pours a fairly dark yet clear ruby red. A pink frothy head retains fairly decent. A light swirl revives a finger of pink froth.  The smell of this brew is surprisingly juicy and fresh with earthy ripe raspberries. It is somewhat pitted and grain or seed-like with a sweet over-ripe raspberry smell that is more rich as sweet smelling than what im use to. It has a light grassy element with a touch of funky/stinky cheese. In the background are notes of oak that are lightly musty. As it warms up, it evolves into almost a floral aspect that is quite appealing.  The taste of this brew is quite sour, the expected acidity of the normal Cantillon offering is augmented with a flavor of unripe raspberry which adds a different dimension of acidity. It is earthy and natural in flavor that is deep and unique that really meshes well with the barrel flavoring that comes across lightly musty. Considering how juicy and sweet smelling this brew was, the level of tartness really shocks the sense which was enjoyable.  This is a light bodied brew with a lively level of high carbonation that is not over-done. For being several years old at this point and in the bottle for more than a year, I found this brew smelling/tasting exceptionally bright and refreshing. I really enjoyed the other Lou Pepe's both on tap and in bottles when I had them, but this came across even more appealing to me. I need more of this brew!",0.6943773593158153,5.0,0.9588
Green,"ing a cold 16 oz can poured into a snifter. The beer pours a very hazy goldenrod color with a fluffy bleached white head of 2 cm that fades gradually to a clingy edge layer and a few wispy islands. This foam sticks around for the sampling and leaves some dense lattice after each sip. The aroma is apparent immediately on the pour into my glass with a good dose of tropical fruit, some pineapple and a bit of peach, but then some pithy citrus rind as well, moving the nose further on the bitter scale. Hop dominant nose on this beer. First sip reveals a creamy textured body with mild yet tingly carbonation. Smooth and easy drinking for the physical traits on this one. Flavor is fairly sweet up front with a lot of fruit notes including pineapple and orange which moves to some rindy pith grapefruit and a little pine sap maybe on the finish. This lingers a bit on the finish with a bit of bitterness, but the sweet fruit also rolls along after the swallow. I dont have a sense of any alcohol on the finish, again making this very drinkable. Quite a tasty IPA and I can see why there is so much love for this beer. Worth purchasing, especially with how fast they move the lines in Charlton!",0.6843891138392029,4.5,0.9587

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Pours dark brown with only a few large bubbles and no head. Vanilla dominates the aroma. There's also cinnamon chocolate brownie in there, and hints of pepper, bourbon, and barrel. The first thing I noticed on the taste is the substantial mouth feel which is an improvement over the other Jackie O's beers I've tried. Vanilla is prominent and the other flavors come through more as well including a substantial dash of heat from the pepper. There's a creamy, milk chocolate quality, big cinnamon spice, and plenty of bourbon to round it off. I love the walnut addition, which gives it a unique flavor that really works. Some dark fruits are there as well. The carbonation is low and the best sips were toward the beginning of the glass when the carbonation was more lively, but that's a small critique. This is really good and really easy to acquire. My first few Jackie O's didn't impress, but I'm glad I stuck with them and acquired some more. Can't wait to try the next beer from that trade.",0.6545687551039597,4.25,0.9586
Chocolate Rain,"The Chocolate Rain is a variation of Black Tuesday. Even though higher in ABV the flavor is a tad lighter.  A. Thick black with a dark brown head.  S. Chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, & coffee.  T. All described in the smell are noticeable but the two flavors that stand out the most while drinking are chocolate and vanilla. Real powerful in taste but stands out more on the sweet side. Not bitter in anyway.  M. Thick syrup and extremely smooth. Consume in a small round glass taking a sip at a time or this beer will be gone before you know it.   Overall I would have to say Black Tuesday is the king of stouts and the variation Chocolate Rain is the cherry on the icing. For 19.5 the alcohol is well hidden and the flavor is extremely enjoyable for any drinkers choice.",0.6403352842529068,5.0,0.9586
Black Tuesday,"Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Small pour (8oz glass), so easily more head formation with a 12oz or larger pour. Aroma is roasted, toasted, and caramel malts with a swell of bourbon behind. Plum, toffee, and molasses give it a little extra boost. Aroma mellows as the beer warms, providing a kaleidoscope of dark stout flavors, with the alcohol receding into the background. Flavor profile is roasted, toasted, and caramel malts quickly followed by toffee, molasses, and bourbon. There is a boozy, heavy burn at the back fresh out of the fridge, but as it warms the bourbon turns to more of a warm liquid, as opposed to a molten express delivery of alcohol. The dense flavor profile covers up the near 20% ABV well, but the booze still peeks through, even after aging for a little over a year. Mouth feel is thick with a velvety, grainy texture. Overall, a hearty, boozy stout with a huge ABV. It remains well balanced all things considered, but the ABV still peaks through.   Served in a 8oz Black Tuesday glass from a 750mL bottle. 2016 bottle reviewed in 2018.",0.663320614759232,4.5,0.9586
Lou Pepe - Framboise,07 vintage bottle split with Bar fly B.   A- a steady pour yields three fingers of fluffy pink head that settles quickly leaving only a few wisps on top. Beautiful slightly hazy deep pink in color that's glows spectacularly when held to light.   S- ripe juicy tart raspberries and musty funky wet wood. Sharp acidity and touches of red wine vinegar. Some barnyard aspects going on but this one is all about the fruits.   T- wow! Now that's a butthole ripper right there. Bracingly sour right upfront with super tart under ripe raspberries and lemon juice. Musty funky yeast and rotten oak. Touches of sweetness attempting to fights its way through the sour but barely making a dent. As the brew does some serious warming the rougher edges smooth out and the whole thing comes together to a level of perfection that no framboise I've had can touch.   M- a few steps less then medium in body and a good bit of sharp bright carb. A pucker that will rip the drawls from yo ass a pull them out ya mouth. My juices are flowing for minutes after each sip.   O- to say this brew is one dimensional is all wrong. Its powerful and confrontational in flavor but very pure and to the point. Massively sour and fruity with all funk playing second fiddle but in a good way. Each and every time I have this beer I'm blown away by it.,0.6715648627084521,4.5,0.9586

T- Taste is of chocolate and vanilla with slight dark fruit smells. Leaves a fantastic after taste of bourbon/vanilla and chocolate. Alcohol shows up big so be ready to be warmed up.   M- Very viscous with good carbonation full bodied beer that is sweet yet balanced considering the abv. Liquid dessert if you ask me.  Overall, this beer is a masterpiece unto itself.

Fort Point Pale Ale,"Beautiful hazy OJ color, definitely brighter, not turbid or anything. A nice creamy, frothy head of 1/2 finger, and leaves bubbly lace skirted on the sides.   Aromas of oranges, orange pith, peel, juice; grapefruit, cracker, and herb.   Pithy grapefruit and orange coming forward first, followed by orange peel, some bright orange juice/pineapple mix, and an herbal bitter/bread finish. I could use a bit more juice here, instead of the bitter-herb-pith I get.  Feel is pithy as well, that's the word of the day here, with a resinous pucker and a soft carbonation profile.   Overall, this is a solid drinker. I don't really think it's the 99 world class rating it gets, but it's a solid 90 for sure.

First sip is a *wallop* of sour, wow. Everything from the nose seems present. Sweet apple cider, bright white wine notes, zesty citrus. Extremely tart through the middle with a tiny bit of relief through the finish. Finish is quite dry, with a lot of dry oak notes. Sweet and sour fruit linger on in the aftertaste. Some funkiness emerges in the finish/aftertaste as well. Alcohol is well hidden.  Medium to medium-light in body, medium slightly-sharp carbonation.

Darkstar November,"Absolutely fantastic beer. Aged for a year. Wish I had another. Like a chocolate milkshake with bourbon, only better. Really terrific bourbon barrel stout. Better than CBS that I had 2 days prior.",0.5429258558126379,4.75,0.9583
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Oh this is good, and my expectations were high. Robust, chewy, viscous, edgy, boozy and smoky. Smell picks up on the robust elements first: leather, wood, coffee, smoke, molasses, then mixed in with the sweeter dark chocolate, bourbon, licorice, ginger, and then a finishing wash of wood tannins, smoke and roasted malt. Taste is more focused on the wood, bourbon and licorice immediately, then the rest of the flavors from the aroma plus a hint of vanilla, great wood throughout. Fantastic heavy stout",0.6677947125851258,4.75,0.9583

Juicy,"This is simply a beautiful beer, top to bottom. It is easily one of my top beers, if not my top beer.   It was a gusher, so be prepared with a glass. The half ounce of beer spilled on the bar was truly tragic.  This beer is listed as ""0 ICUs"", which means there is no ""citrus zest"" added to the beer. That's surprising, as the first thing you notice in the aroma is citrus fruit everywhere. The taste follows, with a barrage of oranges, apricots, and peaches. It continues and builds along with a lurking bitterness from the New Zealand hops. Towards the back end, an explosion of multi-layered Brettanomyces sensation starts, reminiscent of Orval. It finishes with a combination of that Orval-esque Brett flavor and orange citrus. It's aged in Mimosa barrels, which had 500 ICUs if I remember correctly, so the fruit flavors that I was lucky enough to taste in Mimosa are certainly present in Shaun Hill's ""mini-Mimosa"" here in Juicy.  Don't take any of this to mean that the beer is one-note citrus. It's not. Between the sufficient amount of hops to keep a lurking bitterness, the intricate flavoring of Brettanomyces in the back end, and the citrus flavor, it combines to make a truly world-class and wonderful beer. Everyone was absolutely blown away by this beer. It'd be on my short ""desert island"" list for sure.",0.6575664409351295,5.0,0.9582
Todd The Axe Man,"urs a hazy dark orange color with a medium creamy head that slowly dissipates.  S: Huge nose of citrus greets you on the first sniff. Notes of grapefruit, sweet orange, lemon peel. Very little noticeable malt character. Some pine in the background, but the sweet and tart fruit is forefront.  T: Very similar to the aroma. Lots of tart grapefruit, sweet orange, lemon peel. Not a lot of malt, and some pine near the end. A very tasty, fruity IPA.  F: Medium to full body and creamy carbonation.

All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"Amazing to me that a brewery that does IPA's so well can also nail a Stout like this. I only wish this was available more often.

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2007 Vintage (bottled in 2009) poured into an unmarked tulip glass. Pours a bright fizzy red with a thick, dense pink head. The beer is mostly clear with a very slight haze near the cap. Retention of the head is impressive and there is absolutely no lacing left on the glass.  Sour smell with obvious raspberries. I don't get the barnyard funky smell as much as I do a blatant sour.   Immediate puckering blast of sour with this guy. It took me a few drinks to get my bearings and get my mouth to calm down a bit. Very sour, tart, and puckering. There is a sweet raspberry taste mixed in there, but it certainly plays second fiddle to the trademark Cantillon sour. The finish mellows to a lingering sweet-tart like memory that hangs around for quite a while  This was a very nice beer, but just seemed a bit too unbalanced. Medium bodied with a spritzy carbonated feel. The sour dominated the raspberry a bit too much for my taste, but still a very solid brew...  Consumed: 1/29/2010",0.6663719152504359,4.0,0.958
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Got this bottle the day it was bottled from Armand himself. This beer didn’t re-ferment in the bottle yet. Following Armand’s advice, consume the same evening.  Look: pours a deep dark red color with no head Smell: Cherries, fresh cherries and cherries. Light tart, some vinigar, oak and yeasy as well.  Taste: follows the nose. Full of fresh cherries, perfectly balanced by the typical 3 fonteinen funky sourness and wooden tones of the beer.  Mouthfeel: medium body and very low carbonation Overall: Unique to try, significantly different from the bottled and re-fermented one! This is like a lambic with fresh cherries juice. I had world class fruit beers before (hommage, framboos, fou foune, blabaer) but this must be the best fruit taste I ever had. Pure juice, amazing!",0.6689164358397885,5.0,0.958

Aaron,"Big rich barleywine with massive dark fruit, brown sugar, and bourbon. The mouthfeel is just shy of a rich stout. The beer coats the mouth with a warming from the bourbon and the richness of the beer is sweet enough to balance it. One of the best barleywines I've had.",0.6532265481201943,4.75,0.9578
Oude Geuze Vintage,"2003 Vintage, many thanks to hannont for sharing this.  This beer defies traditional reviewing. Yes, classic gueuze aromas of hay and barnyard and lemon and a refreshing tartness, but what I really mean to say is: this beer smells and tastes like heaven. With complete seriousness, I think this is the best beer I have ever tasted. Should you find yourself in the presence of this beer, do not pass it up under any circumstances.",0.6074623902381789,5.0,0.9578
Sang Noir,"Enjoyed after a nice rest in the cellar. Complex melange of aromas and taste - sour mash, oak, vinous grapes, dark fruit, puckering green apple and candied fruit.  Fruit acids, wine tannins, oak, bourbon starches and sugars - pleasantly tart and incredibly smooth. Hints of a well made manhattan.   No heat or zap from the ABV. Easy to drink and enjoy; nowhere near enamel stripping or harsh. A true beauty.",0.6824135039839626,4.5,0.9578
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,Poured a beautiful hazy golden with a thick head. The aroma of banana and pepper. It was very lively on the tongue With a nice level of carbonation. On the palate the flavor of banana and clove and a back note of bubble gum came through especially as the beer warmed while I was drinking it. It had a wonderful mouthfeel and was crisp without being overly dry. For the full experience I suggest taking out of your fridge and letting it stand 10-15 minutes before drinking it. Very good.,0.6886730743694183,4.5,0.9577
Flora - Blueberry,"375ml bottle. Thanks Dustin. Poured into a taster glass 8/9/2014.  A- Beautiful purple-blue body with a nice half finger pink head. Wow. This is so unique and beautiful looking.  S- Blueberries galore. This is full of rich, bright blueberries with that Vermont funk. Lots of white vinous smell here as well. Fantastic.  F- Unfortunately it doesn't quite live up to how it smells; fairly restrained with a fair amount of white vinous tartness mixed in with a touch of blueberries; there's a bit of that base Florence wheat flavour as well.  M- Medium in body, fairly well carbonated. The finish leaves a bit to be desired compared to Flora. I'd have liked a bit more of a dry white wine finish to it.  O- Regular Flora is still king.. But this beer looks and smells absolutely phenomenal.",0.6622376674281819,5.0,0.9577
Black Tuesday,"Bottle opened and split on 6.29.13  2012 Vintage  A - Pours a deep brown/black with a few dark tan bubbles that form, move to the edges and then fade away quickly.  S - Bourbon, alcohol heat, chocolate, vanilla, roasted malts.  T - Bourbon and lots of heat, chocolate, vanilla, roasted malts. Very good.  D - Heavy body with lower carbonation.  O - This is a great beer that I have just never gotten around to opening. It was a nice bbq with friends over, so we opened some good beers. This was one of the hilights for me. Lots of boozy bourbon, heat, and layers of chocolate and vanilla. Wonderful beer.",0.6187358768221168,4.5,0.9577
Space Trace,"Special thanks to DaveHack for sharing this one with me. The pour of this beer is much like the other Bottle Logic stouts. It's a very deep black color with a thin head on top.

Overall this beer is awesome.",0.6381513631191033,4.5,0.9577
Aaron,Aaron is a great example of an English Barleywine. It looks and smells like some of the classic barleywines out of the UK. The addition of the barrel aging that Shaun does so well just sends it over the top as one of the better examples of English Barleywines. The right level of sweetness that doesn't overpower the beer but marries up well with ABV which I have to assume is on the higher side. Another great beer from Hill Farmstead.,0.5685974042351204,4.5,0.9577
Coolship Red,"Had this in tap at the Allagash tap takeover at Novare Res on April 5, 2014. The color was most amazing. It looked like Kool-Aid.

Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,#5000 - Thanks to Millerbuffoon for sharing this excellent Saison. This beer poured out as a hazy yellow color with a decent looking white head on top. The beer has some subtle notes of funk and citrus going on in it. The taste has a bit of sweetness upfront that changes into a tart citrusy finish. The feel of the beer is light bodied with a good carbonation to it. Overall it's a very solid Saison.,0.6837626430823195,4.25,0.9576
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Pours a dark red color with a light pink head. Scent is funky as shit with sweaty gym socks and sweet cherries. Tons of barnyard funk and tart cherry aroma. Not nearly as funky as the regular kriek from 3F though. Taste is immediately sour cherry and biting vinegar. Tons of sour and barrel flavors. Lovely barnyard funk. Awesome cherry flavors. Mouthfeel is sour and sticky on the teeth...medium bodied. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is an amazing kriek lambic. I wish I could do a side by side with the regular kriek from this awesome brewery. 3F never lets me down.",0.6273408017024491,4.5,0.9576
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"bottle dated ""10/16/2018"" or packaged as Bell's likes to use. This was poured into a snifter. The appearance was a nice looking dark brown close to black color topped with a slim cap of a little off white semi-foamy head. Barely any lace. The aroma had some dark bittersweet chocolate roaming into stealthy woody sweet to spicy barrel with a whiff of a vanilla edge roaming into some caramel covered biscuits. Light toffee coated milk chocolate malts layer themselves into the end of the nose. The flavor moderately presented a superb blend of a ""cool-headed"" range of bittersweet dark and milk chocolate malts playing with some caramel to biscuity sweet tastes. Subtle toffee to vanilla and woody characters grip nicely. Nice aftertaste of some pulled sweet coffee mentality to sticky caramel then nutty to toffee-ness. The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a fair sipping quality about it. Some distracting woody spicy harshness comes about to push out the ability to take larger portions down my throat. Good carbonation and ABV. Mild spicy finish with woody dryness and caramel and a smooth blend of sweet to bitter chocolates. Overall, the base beer is there, but becoming ""covered"" a bit as it ages. Is it me or why do people think ""barrel aged beers"" are better than their regular counterparts? Hmmmmm...I beg to differ.",0.6892172505588187,4.25,0.9575
Dragonsaddle,"Not to be cliche, but this monster hides the alcohol content extremely well. Super juicy, big pillowy body, and doesn’t carry the sharpness you get from a lot of triples. Finishes clean. Outstanding.",0.6755108958636179,4.75,0.9575
Black Tuesday,"750ml bottle, 2016 edition, shared by a random at rogerdandy's latest typically epic bottle share.   This beer pours a solid black, with a few minor cola highlights, and one stocky finger of rocky, chunky, and bubbly brown head, which leaves surprisingly very little lace around the glass as it slowly sinks away.  It smells of burnt caramel malt, charred toffee, vulcanized rubber, vanilla-forward Bourbon barrel, bittersweet cafe-au-lait, medium cocoa powder, and a further mildly acrid booziness. The taste is bready and doughy caramel malt, dark chocolate, rather warm Bourbon barrel essences, creamed coffee, vanilla extract, and more plain leafy, weedy, and perfumed floral hoppiness.  The carbonation is fairly low due to its weak frothiness, the body a solid, no-nonsense heavyweight, and pretty smooth, with an alcohol-laced creaminess. It finishes sweet and hot - both in a very good way.  Overall, Black Tuesday is yet another stellar behemoth from this SoCal brewing concern - the Bourbon is certainly present, yet hardly intrusive, which renders this one stupidly easy to put back. Great stuff - but yeah, definitely made to share, as already mentioned a few times.",0.6711567484783968,4.5,0.9574
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Poured from 500ml bottle into a Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen glass. Pours a beautiful golden color with perfect head that is slightly billowy and remains for a while. I’m in love already. Smell is a nice balance between fruit and typical spices like clove and slight banana. Aromatic is the word which comes to mind. Taste is phenomenal with fruit on the front end and spice on the back. Lingering notes of citrus and grape add to the enjoyment. Mouthfeel is flawless- medium bodied but not thin. Overall this is the top Hefeweizen in my book. If you try one Hefeweizen, this is the one to try. The only other beers which come close are from Schneider and Sons or Ayinger. This is good both from the tap or the bottle. Mead of the gods!",0.6670037676396299,5.0,0.9574
Enjoy By IPA,"Pours a very lightly hazy pale copper in color with a finger of white head. Very hoppy, pine, some citrus, and a bit of tropical fruit. Taste follows the nose and is hugely hoppy, the flavors are somewhat less distinct than the aromas but tropical fruits are more pronounced here but pine and citrus are still present. I get a bit of booze here as well but it's not unexpected given the 9.4% ABV. Good mouthfeel, medium bodied and moderate carbonation. Overall a very good beer but I will say that I found it far more enjoyable straight from the bottle as opposed to from a glass.",0.7079023675895874,4.25,0.9574
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Review 5000, holy Shit, never expected to get here, a huge number, incredible.  Bottled 8/04/2004, don't remember how I got this  Pours light fizzy head that fades fairly quickly, hazy orange slight amber color, and even has good lacing.  Nose is incredible, basically the epitome of everything good about gueuze, some horse blanket funk, cheesy funk, big tart fruit, sour acidic funk, aged lactic acetic acid, an acidic citrus grapefruit, kiwi berry fruit, aged funk, just yes!  Taste is very tart, tons of grapefruit rind, super bitter funky fruit, big farmhouse funk, horse blanket, cheesy funk, big vinous grape skin, tons of funk, great gueuze typical Drie Fonteinen at its best. Finish is dry big funk, little flemmy and acidic, fruit, grapefruit.  Mouth is med to lighter bod, lighter carb though, typical acidity flemmy  Overall just ridiculous, I'm so glad I got to drink this.

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Very impressive beer. Quite a bit of spiciness from the peppers. Barrel aging adds some heat, but it blends very well into this beer. Cinnamon notes and vanilla present as well. Very good complex beer. Would be happy to have again.",0.6927323331892358,4.5,0.9572
Beatification,"375ml poured into Bruery tulip. Batch 5 bottled 1/10/12. Sent to me from an awesome BA, and good guy RC0032.  A - Golden, clear, very little or no head  S - Lemon, funk, hay. Notes of soured pear, must, and a light sweetness at the end  T - Immediately bombards the tongue with a blast of lactic sourness. Very tart, mouth puckering. Lemon and sour pear dominate, funk creeps in everywhere. Enough acetic acid to add some depth, but not a huge vinegar presence here. Slight hints of oak on the finish.  M - A little heavier than other Russian River brews, but still medium bodied overall. Enough small bubbles to make it crisp and refreshing from pour to finish. Mouthfeel and carbonation accent the intense tart/sourness flavors.   O - Having had all the other RR offerings, I wasn't sure what to expect with this one. I got a beer that had enough complexity to keep a smile on my face, and enough lactic sourness to burn a hole through ones stomach. Not particularly balanced, but intense and a fantastic example of what American wilds can be! Would love to try this with a bit more age on it.",0.6768758150616492,4.5,0.9572
Beatification,"Bit of funkiness on the nose. Picking up some fruit, citrus like flavors, lemonade. Almost tastes like it's aged on apricots. Very balanced white wine with sour tart flavors.

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Had this on tap at DLD 2010. Review from notes on 4/24/10.  A - Poured a deathly black, lovely dark brown hue in the light with a scant tan head. No lace remained. 4.0  S - Big, roasty, and lots of caramel. Hint of vanilla and charred oak in the background. Touch of figs and dark fruit as well. 4.5  T - This robust beer is definitely a highlight of the day. The intense cocoa, caramel, and roasted barley mingles with the delicate tones of vanilla and wood, finishing extremely rich with an everlasting dark chocolate and plum finish. 4.5  M - Not as viscous as I had thought it would be, but a lovely richness with moderate carbonation. 4.0  D - For the abv, highly drinkable. 4.5",0.6746689536839983,4.5,0.9571

T: similarto the aroma, peaches, tart fruits, Belgian sweetness and spices, and barnyard flavors. The finish is clean and bready.  M: light body with medium carbonation, this beer is light and drinkable.  O: an enjoyable beeroverall.

Double Orange Starfish,"L: Poured from a growler to a snifter glass. Had a dark orange color and a super-cloudy consistency. There was a 3/4"", foamy, very long-lasting head. Excellent lacing.  S: A sweet and alluring aroma of hops, citrus fruit, malt, and some tropical fruit.  T: Tasted of a mild bit of malt (mostly in the finish), a big shot of citrus fruit (mostly orange), a good amount of hops (not overdone), and light tropical fruit notes (mango, perhaps?). This is a big, juicy, sweet flavor. Aslin has the NE IPA flavor down pat, and this is no exception. It has just enough hops to keep things interesting. Very tasty stuff.  F: A well-carbonated beer with a lively finish. Medium-bodied.  O: A fantastic NE IPA. Definitely drinkable.",0.6709120974710109,4.25,0.9571
Mastermind,"Can from Fiddlehead.  Cloudy straw-yellow color, with a medium-sized white head that dwindled to a wispy layer, leaving dabs of lacing on the glass. Lots of citrus and tropical fruit in the nose, with some funky/earthy undertones that seemed a little weird to me. Blast of pineapple up front in the taste, hoppy and fresh; after a few minutes, the fruitiness faded a bit, leaning more towards oily hop resins, almost West Coast. Mouthfeel was a little thinner than I would have expected / liked, a little watery, but the body was quite crisp for a DIPA, making this a pretty easy drinker. I haven't been a huge fan of Fiddlehead's beers so far, but this was probably the best I've had from them, and I'd definitely seek it out again.",0.6827509730256178,4.5,0.9571
Darkstar November,"In Mid-April 2018, I had a full 2017 vintage bottle for a full review, and it was fantastic.  Appearance is stark matte black with a mocha foam head that settles to a persistent, creamy blanket.  Smell is dark chocolate syrup and molasses with hints of vanilla, coconut and nougat as deep, intense and savory roast is paired evenly with a darkly charred, wet nutty oak and spiced bourbon.  Taste is spicy and bourbony yet also peanutty, roasty, and savory turning chocolatey and molassesy. Complex and simple all at once--a boozy stout lover's dream! At it's warmest, black licorice surfaces.  The medium round body has a crunchy fizz, finishing stingingly semi-dry, with a hot exhale.  At DLD 2017:  This beer surprised me with decadent flavors despite the absence of the usual flavor additives that are featured in some of their other stouts. I actually liked this more than Ground State, and a couple other Bottle Logic pours I had at DLD, as well as some Cycle stouts. I actually get vanilla, chocolate donuts, and a hint of maple and coconut from the oak, which is only slightly hot. I mean, really?! This made me want to make a run for at least a full bottle or two (as satisfied above).",0.6789854526058108,4.25,0.957
Haze,"Poured to an Ora et Labora taster.  A: Body is superb with opaque matte yellow coloration and a huge 2cm thick white dense head. You can't get any better than this. S: Aroma is very interesting with an agressive hop profile in the beginning, acting more like a green-ish approach to the aroma. No citric tones. T: Taste is so soft and amazing to a DIPA, you wouldn't expect to find this beer so soft on bitterness and sweetness. It's almost an umami like flavour centered in the middle of the beer. It's even a bit spicy towards the end. M: Body is medium, carbonation is perfect, just a bit of alcohol noticed in the end towards a more green-ish bitterness. O: Great and huge beer that is so drinkable for a DIPA that it falls under the non-imaginable.",0.699027122471343,4.5,0.957
Todd The Axe Man,"Picked up a 16 oz can from TW Arrowhead 3-12-17 for $5.49. Canned on 2-9-17 and stored in the beer fridge since purchase.  Beer poured an unfiltered golden orange with a nice white head with the initial pour.  Nose is awesome, juicy citrus dominates with some hints of tropical and stone fruits in the background.  Taste is very good; a lovely juicy citrus greets the palate and pretty much dominates the flavor profile.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and both smooth and refreshing.   Overall this brew is very good and i would repeat buy if a fresh batch comes into Arizona. Not quite comparable taste and texture wise to the classic Alpine IPA's but very enjoyable nonetheless.",0.6890829634035086,4.25,0.957

Appearance: Pours a bright golden yellow with less than a finger of a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly to a thin collar. Body is mostly clear with hight visible carbonation.   Smell: Bright lemon, white grape, green apple, funk hay and oak.   Taste: Light barnyard, hay, green apple, lemon and other citrus with some mild neutral oak. High acidic sourness that borders on mouth puckering.   Mouthfeel: Light bodied, and bit thin with medium lively carbonation. Finishes dry.  Overall: One of the best American spontaneously fermented beers I've had and probably the closest tasting to an actual lambic (though still not quite the same).

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"LP Framboise served in a tulip glass. Sticker is 2010 vintage, with a cork/bottling date of 2013.  Appearance: Pours a brilliant, clear, gorgeous, blood red. Generous two-finger foamy head that is a light pink color. No lace in the glass  Smell: Freshly smashed raspberries on a bright summer day. A slight musty basement-like aroma. Hint of lengthy oak aging subtlety blends into the background. Acetic vinegar. Ends with a touch of funk.  Taste: The taste bursts with a cascading waterfall of acetic vinegar. Just the right amount of fresh raspberry sweetness cuts into the vinegar and provides a perfect balance. You'll swear you can taste the musty basement, but not in a bad way. It's very complex and has layers of flavor. There's a lot going on here that is difficult for my palette to discern, but rest assured it's world-class.  Mouthfeel: A low, effervescent carbonation paired with a light-body. It is wet and refreshing as it glides gracefully around the mouth. The finish on this Lou Pepe Framboise is incredible as the flavor just seems to last forever.   Overall: What an incredible drinking experience. This Cantillon is world-class, near-perfection of what a fruited, funky sour should be. I'm thoroughly excited to try my Lou Pepe Kriek's and might even hang onto my 2009 Lou Pepe Gueuze.",0.6814685948662249,5.0,0.9569
Juicy,Dark golden in color almost amber with an off white head that dissipated quickly but kept a cap and great lacing throughout the drink.  Nose is spicy with a lot of citrus pith and a hint of tartness. Hill Farmstead signature house character is definitely there.  Taste follows with a super citrusy hop type profile and a little grass and dried citrus peel on the finish. Completely dry and finishes swift. Extremely drinkable.   2015 Vintage poured into a wine glass.,0.6895913409027571,4.5,0.9568
Black Tuesday,"2014 vintage. Poured into a wine glass. Absolutely incredible. lots of dates, raisins chocolate, bourbon, charred oak and sweet molassas in the nose. the taste is true to the nose. Bourbon chocolate and sweet raisins. it's a sweet beer but not overly sweet. this absolutely blew me away. i can not smell or taste the alcohol for the 19.7%. I would have to say this is the best bourbon barrel aged imperial stout I have ever had.",0.6026771376594174,4.5,0.9568
Madagascar,"On draft, into snifter.  Dark (but not pitch black) appearance, no foam head. Just a nice ring around the edge as you drink. Load of vanilla smell. Very vanilla forward and loads of marshmallow beat up the palate with a smooth ending. Bourbon note is there but not overpowering. The taste and feel is really dominated by vanilla. Overall a great stout, and one of the better vanilla ones out there. Would happily drink again, if I could ever find it.",0.6669747080949636,4.5,0.9568
Black Tuesday,"Black, viscous, thick and creamy this oozed into the glass with a thin brown head and no lacing.  All the aromas of a barrel aged stout I caught creamy coconut, vanilla and creamy milky tones.  Absolutely first class in taste this has all the complexity you want but yet seems so simple. Some candied fruits and sweet honey are enclosed by milk chocolate, caramel and toffee. The taste has an ideal sweetness level as it doesn't overwhelm but satisfies completely.  This is 19.2 pct ABV, and apparently that's not a typo. Holy Crap! I would never have guessed as there's no alcohol bite or boozy flavor. All I feel is a rich, smooth and full flavored beer.",0.6718637340747299,4.5,0.9568
Sip Of Sunshine,I prefer double IPAs but this is a very good single IPA. Lots of floral flavor. Have had this both on tap and from the can and both are great - similar to alchemists heady topper in the sense that the smell is the best part (IMO),0.6260476420534985,4.5,0.9568
Todd The Axe Man,"Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip   L: Dark hazy gold, inviting color with about a half finger of head ...minimal lacing.   A: Pine, cane sugar and candied citrus  T: A good bit of malt with orange and all so quick to fade bitter quality with some booze. Pleasant but not a long lasting roll across the palate, loud and then it stops.   MF: Medium in body, medium to light carbonation (could be because of age of the can?) and a bit of lingering stickiness on the lips.   O: A beer that was clearly great as it was canned and has waned into an above par but still interesting IPA. Classic in all the right ways, enough abv to keep you grinning and a fine-tuned balance that is welcome and often missed in today's IPA offerings.",0.6639012972427619,4.25,0.9568
Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Split with Goblinmunkey7 on 8/19/17, review from notes  A: Golden straw with a touch of orange, lightly hazy, pours with a fluffy, medium-sized white head, retains its fluffiness, leaves great streaks of lacing  S: Funky, deep, complex - saison funk, yeast funk, barnyard funk - light tartness - lemon - flowery and floral - light grains, light sweetness - loads of wood, rich oak - layers of funk  T: Bright saison funk and tartness - farmhouse weirdness including some damp cellar and straw - some brighter acidity and lemon - flowery - some pear, green apple - rich oak, chewy wood - light sweetness with some lingering funk  M: Medium body, medium carbonation, crisp with lingering tart funk   O: Cellarman is the hero Gotham deserves  Cellarman flirts with almost being too funky to be a saison, but it does not cross any lines (not that anyone is really too concerned). It's bright, it's tart, it's like drinking a barn.",0.6889786030550403,4.25,0.9568
Darkstar November,"Pours like oil. Midnight black. Can't see through it. Looks super thick. Smell is of some barrel, molasses sweetness, roastiness. Taste is real good with molasses sweetness cutting any booze, some barrel. Real good. Drinks thick. Very viscous. Overall, a damn good BA Imperial Stout. Cannot tell this is 13.7%.",0.618635619625468,4.5,0.9567
Swish,"From a 16oz can, undated but purchased at the brewery when released on 03/23/17. Served in an imperial pint glass.  A profoundly turbid, gloriously ugly glass of beer that looks like dirty grapefruit juice with a one-finger head of creamy, scuzzy froth. Not much in the way of retention, maybe a minute, leaving a moderate ring of suds and a thin sheet of weak lacing. It looks thick enough to stand a spoon up in.   The nose is all fresh, yeasty white bread, tropical fruit basket and vanilla flowers. I don't need to hold it near my face because I could smell it as soon as the can was half opened.  Taste is soft and juicy, pineapple and melon, orange, mango, kiwi, papaya, guava... yada, yada, yada - emphasis on the sweet, aromatic tropical fruits, less on the citrus, although there is grapefruit and lime lurking there in the background as supporting players - all layered over a solid, substantial, in fact hefty, damp-grain malt body. Dank, weedy and earthy. Finishes surprisingly quickly with just a little bitter melon stuck to the palate and an aromatic fruit basket of hops swirling in the sinuses.  The feel is... I'm getting tired of writing 'juicy' but, anyway, the feel is smooth and juicy, medium-thick and brightly carbonated. Terrifyingly easy to drink.  Overall, like I even need to say it, in the top-tier of NEDIPA's. I waited a long time for this because I never seem to be in Portland at the right time and now it's all I can do not to drink all my cans in one sitting. I'm so excited that I may have peed my pants a little.",0.6734104402043035,4.5,0.9566
Society & Solitude #4,"750ml growler opened on September 4, 2012. I'm fearful for the day when a google search of ""Society & Solitude"" brings up Hill Farmstead beers instead of Emerson, but according to Greg Currie, literature can't give us insight into the mind and its workings anyways, so I drink Hill Farmstead when I could be reading Emerson.   Pours a cloudy tangerine yellow-orange. A finger of resilient, creamy white head sticks around.   Riper-than-ripe juicyfruit nose. Unbelievable tropical fruit, mango, tangerine, lemon citrus, pineapple, maybe a hint of green leafy bitterness. Bright, bitter, and brilliant.  More of the same. A citra bomb on the front of the palate, beaming citrus and pineapple, playing right into galaxy's passionfruit/tropical fruit brilliance. Mango juice. This beer sweats more juicy, fruity bitterness than other beers are made of. Resinous finish. Just enough sweetness to pull this back from the too-bitter.   Creamy; medium, medium light bodied.   At this point I'm convinced Shaun knows something other brewers don't. One of my personal favorites from his repertoire of IPAs/DIPAs, and playing right into my weaknesses, S&S #4 is a nearly perfect showcase of what citra and galaxy can do.",0.6632764639925309,4.5,0.9566
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"From HayesEz.  Dark brown flat in the center, tan to the edges. No head.  Solid Aroma, easily the best part of this. Molasses, boooze, vanilla, brown sugar.  Taste is a bit thin. Vanilla extract, bourbon, malt. Notacibly different from the regular DL which I often find soy/burned/malt. This was solid, if unspectacular.  Not much to the body, a bit of a sticky mouthfeel, and still a bit thin. Odd, more bourbon than stout.  Really good, enjoyed it. The other people I split it with enjoyed it as well.   (184th)",0.6875747289139712,4.0,0.9566
Haze,"Golden and hazy, not overly opaque like Green, but moderately hazy, with 2 fingers of whitish head. Some chunks of yeast are floating within. Nice, chunky lacing as well.  Smells of dank, tropical fruit, onions and garlic, green leaf, papayas, jackfruit, mangos, cumin and body odour. Lighter notes of lemon and oranges are in there too.  Huge dank and tropical fruit BOMB! All the flavours I mentioned on the nose are accelerated on the tongue! More notes of green leaf, catnip, and skunk cabbage are on the tongue.   Rich, big, smooth and resinous body. Moderate to low carbonation, the kind that is light but foams up like a reaction in your mouth.  Got this January 3rd at Tree House Brewery in Massachusetts. It was handed for free to me by the guy ahead of me in line, who found out I'd travelled from Thailand to try Tree House brews for the first time. Thanks Bro from Connecticut, whoever you are! Drinking by Lake Muskoka Jan 22nd, 2018.",0.6263101365193041,4.5,0.9566
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Impressive complexity and mouthfeel. Just a hair drier than most imperial Stouts, but anything but thin. It's expensive yes. But it's also amazing.  oh, also has the best balance of barrel flavors with the base beer.",0.7162415348098778,4.75,0.9565
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2012 sticker poured into a fluted glass. While this beer is visually striking with a lovely raspberry scent, the taste and mouthfeel are the stars here. Fantastic balance of funk, fruit and sour. Even a hour after opening there is still huge carbonation. A complete joy. One of the best beers I've ever had.",0.6709255817620581,5.0,0.9565
Peche 'n Brett,"Thanks to Jason for sharing this.  Pours a minimally cloudy golden color with a fluffy white head.   The nose gives off some funky tones from the brett, with some underlying peach.  Very refreshing taste. Light funkiness from the brett gives way to peach yogurt flavors. Tasty.  Mouthfeel is good, perhaps a touch over carbed.  Overall this is a great brew, I see it as a nice sipper on a warm day. I would definitely drink this again.",0.670880521118156,4.25,0.9565
Chocolate Rain,"750 ml bottle poured into a tulip. This is a review of the 2013 vintage bottled on 3/04/13  A: Pours pitch black with no head retention, no lacing, average amount of carbonation streaming up the sides, looks a little more carbonated that other barrel aged stouts, looks pretty oily.  A: Lots of bourbon, toasted coconut, getting a hint of oak, not getting any chocolate, just tons of bourbon, toasted coconuts and some alcohol coming through on the nose, has a lot of aroma.   T: Big hit of bourbon, toasted coconut, hint of oak, some brown sugar sweetness, some heat from the alcohol and bourbon, touch of chocolate sweetness in the aftertaste, incredibly smooth for the ABV but there is some heat on the aftertaste. Chocolate is the prevailing note in the aftertaste. Lots of flavors, big flavors.  M: Big oily mouthfeel, heavy bodied, perhaps the heaviest bodied beer I may have ever tasted.   O: A huge beer, with huge flavors, huge mouthfeel, it's amazingly drinkable for 18 % ABV but it does creep up on you. This bottle is almost three years old and probably could have been cellared longer, it has held up pretty good, but I think the chocolate has faded a bit as it's not as prevalent as I was expecting. Overall a world class.",0.6520817100080508,4.75,0.9565
Todd The Axe Man,"Look: Really nice golden, leaning toward amber, color. Decent head retention. Smell: Awesome! Fresh pine and grass, with heavy citrus notes, something like orange peel and grapefruit Taste: Similar to the nose, citrus flavor really shines, with some of the pine/grass bitterness in there for balance Feel: Extremely smooth. Dangerously slow, as this beer is extremely easy to just keep drinking.  Overall: One of the best beers I've had, and a near perfect example of an IPA!",0.7188741557758688,4.75,0.9565
Juicy," a hazy amber color with a half-finger of off-white head. The head settles into a halo, leaving some lacing as it dissipates.   The aroma is bright, tart, and complex. Sour apples, grapes and lemon rind up front. Grassy and quite hoppy. Back end is full of vanilla oak and caramel notes, as well as plenty of doughy yeast.   The flavor follows the nose. Tart and citrusy on the front end, hoppy and vegetal in the middle. Finishes very doughy and yeasty, with plenty of vanilla, caramel, and some slight funk.   The body is medium-light, with moderate carbonation. Goes down smooth and very creamy. Lightly crisp and fairly dry. Faint lingering acidity.   Overall, a fantastic farmstead ale that is extremely flavorful and complex. It's a perfect balance of sweet, hoppy, and tart, with just enough funk to remind you what kind of beer you are enjoying.",0.7291306737990692,4.5,0.9565
Haze,"Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a Tree House snifter; produced on 10/25/2017 -- three days ago. A: Pours a very cloudy, bright, light orange color with a one inch head, good retention, and robust lacing. S: The fragrance reaches out to the nose from a distance while decanting. Aromas of mango, orange, pineapple, and peach predominate. Pepper/pine/spice notes. T: Largely follows the nose with flavors of peach and orange dominant. Bitterness kicks in slowly, leading to a refreshing finish. M: Medium bodied with solid carbonation. Creamy and smooth. O: This is really a great New England style DIPA, honestly the best that I have had. Certainly worth a trip to the brewery.",0.6792261270338017,4.75,0.9565
Madagascar,"Poured out as a nice rich black color with a thin tan head on top. The smell of the beer has a nice mix of vanilla and roasted malts on the nose, some subtle barrel aroma in there too. The taste is loaded with vanilla, It's really impressive how much they got the flavor to come forward. The feel is medium to full bodied. Overall I though the beer was awesome.",0.6893622915700494,4.25,0.9565
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2007 vintage, bottles in September 2009.  A: Ruby red with a small pink head that leaves some lacings.  S: The smell is a bit mild with notes of raspberries, grass and mild funky notes. Not a whole lot of acidity.  T: The taste is tart with muted but clean raspberry flavors. Somewhat acidic. Notes of grass and raspberry seeds, and funky notes of mud and hey. Wood. The finish has a mild grassy bitterness to it and notes of minerals and dry raspberry notes.  M: Surprisingly full body (still moderate though) with very sparkling carbonation.  D: Good. Very drinkable. However, it seems to lack complexity and is slightly to clean in character. It seems ""young"", which isn't that weird since this bottle was only a couple of months old. Would probably be way better in a year or so.",0.6784493567914089,4.0,0.9565
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Pours a black/brown color with a creamy mocha head, that recedes to a fresh collar. Smells of chocolate and bourbon with some toffee and roasted malts. Strong Barrel presence on this it very good a tad hot still, bourbon was not as mellow as i like but still very good, mothfeel was a little thin but this stout packs a punch of BA. Overall was very tasty and a pleasure to sip.",0.640857094573417,4.25,0.9565
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Pours out an off-red with orange highlights. Speckle of white head dissipitated into near nothing on the top.  A funky aroma gives way to tart raspberries and a sweet candyish aroma, almost of sweet raspberry juice. Big, bold and sour.  Huge tartness of fresh green grape and apple skins give way to a ripe raspberry sweetness. It finishes up with tart, sour and dry pre-ripe green raspberry, which makes you long for another sip.  Beautifully well crafted and very in-depth. Possibly a bit too much for my palate to take at the moment, but easily more drinkable then a straight out geuze. A lot leaner and subtler then expected. I would like to put one away for a few years, see how it goes.",0.6930100615248134,4.5,0.9565
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"12 oz. staff bottle split 4 ways.  A: Dark thick and viscous with a puffy marshmallow head with great retention.  S: Maple syrup bourbon pancakes. Hints of Vanilla, very nice.  T: The bourbon is the predominant note that fades into coffee and bittersweet dark chocolate, not as much Maple as the nose would suggest. Also on the back end there was this Splenda/Aspartame-like artificial sweetness that really detracts from this beer, a characteristic I also noticed with Assassin.  M: Chewy, thick, wonderful. Perfect.  O: This beer is pretty good, but in all honesty it's not better than CBS was fresh. Really not worth what it takes to track down, and not even close to being a ""Perfect 5"" beer.",0.6530057546919777,4.75,0.9564
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"Probably my least favorite of the Sweet Milk Stout series, although still a really great beer.   Super chocolate bomb with not much else going on. A little thinner than the other stout offerings. If you love chocolate stouts you will love this.",0.5649568746847674,4.25,0.9564
Juicy,"Revisit review:  Bottled Dec. 2016  Moderate pour yields a 1/2 inch head that is gone in a few minutes with a thin ring to the end. Fairly clear and bright, light amber body. Nose of citrus, oak, slight straw/hay, and even slighter champagne vinegar. Taste follows with pink grapefruit and a very nice champagne-like dryness. Nice mouth feel with a nice, dry finish of yellow grapefruit. Overall, yes; I could drink this for days on end!",0.6418888171816204,4.75,0.9564
Sip Of Sunshine,"Picked up a four-pack today from the Global Beverage Warehouse in Ellsworth, ME for $16.99. Canned on 8-13-19; consumed on 8-28-19 - a toast to my bro @Sunsjammer - happy birthday bro - i am sure you will approve of this brew!  Beer poured a deep golden with a very nice white head that is leaving lacing behind.  Nose is fragrant with mango, pineapple, and orange.  Taste is a very nice combination of a larger pale malt base with those tropical influences of mango and pineapple. Definitely influence from orange tinged hops with a classic rind bitterness to remind you this is a double ipa! 8/10 on my bitterness scale.  Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and very refreshing despite the abv.  Overall definitely an excellent ipa that is worth the price of admission!",0.6591476850229865,4.5,0.9563
Swish,"Look, feel and taste is world class. That great mouth feel with an unforgettable fruity aftertaste that you won't find anywhere else. Could use a little more aroma but I can't complain. One of 3 best NEipa in New England thus far. Keep up the great work guys.",0.5952825652201287,4.75,0.9563
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  L: Amazing. Cloudy and golden/orange. Just like you expect and WANT your wheat beers to look. Great frothy white head. Perfect example.   S: I'm not quite seasoned in smelling all of the notes like many reviewers are. I'm still very new to the craft beer game. However, banana swept right into my nose as soon as I poured it. That rarely happens for me but boy was it there on this one. Delicious!  T: So smooth. Initially I got that bready, malty taste Germany is so well known for. But then there was a definite smooth banana flavor. I did notice at the tail end of the beer some spiciness. Very faint but it was there. I'm assuming the cloves?   F: smooth. No bitter back end. Pure easy drinking. Could do a couple of these!",0.6473912648784025,4.75,0.9562
Scaled Up,"Cloudy like all Trillium unfiltered beers. The color is dirty gold. Modest head which settles to the finest film of bubbles. There's a few spots for lace.   The smell is complex with a bit of bubblegum, berry fruitiness, and mild flowery hop. Attractive ask and inviting.   A smooth DIPA with a solid malt base. The dominates but doesn't mask the base. The beer is rich with an above average carbonation level. The finish is peppery and oddly refreshing (crisp) given the style. The aftertaste is not exclusively bitter; I get light berry sweetness as well.",0.7306660765337939,4.0,0.9562
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Served in a 16oz cup at Three Floyds 4/26/08. Thanks to HeatherAnn for the assist!  A: Looks like Norwegian black metal served in a plastic cup. Awe inspiring viscous body that clings to the inside of the cup when swirled. Small dark brown/espresso crema colored head.  S: Huge sweet aroma of blackened malt, coconut, molassas, oak, espresso beans, boozy bourbon, dark chocolate, and cherry.  T: See above. That's all you have to do.  M: Incredibly chewey. Feels like taking a swig of half & half but has the look of old nasty gear oil drained out of a junkyard diff.  D: Would've scored a perfect 5 if it didn't annihilate my taste buds (which it did!). The alcohol isn't very apparent 'till I got to the bottom of the glass and it felt like my cheeks were burning. Awesome!",0.6044665570662457,4.5,0.9562

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"On tap at DLD '08. Poured a thick used motor oil opaque black/brown with a thin mocha head. Not so much lace, but a thick oily residue was left clinging to the sides of the cup. The aroma was robust and full of strong coffee and chocolate with a hint of detectable bourbon. Same for the flavor. The bourbon was not overpowering or intense, it just added another layer of complexity. The mouthfeel did not suffer from the barrel-aging. It was thick and sticky as ever. A great beer, but I still prefer my Dark Lord without the bourbon.",0.6471513333009182,3.5,0.9561
Green,"can dated 7.27.17 so fresh and so green green  stoked to finally try this and should be in the sweet spot age wise. brilliant pour with thick haze and a nice bright white head, some lacing left behind. pretty aromatic but profile pops even more on palate. the overall theme is ripe fruits, dankity pine and grassy and herbaceous green notes. up front are soft and creamy peaches, over ripe mango, spicy plastic dank, creamy sorbet note, bubblegum, nectarines, melon, grapefruit, doughy malts, mellow pine resin. mouthfeel is medium bodied but pure fluff. what an awesome brew!!",0.6871281351866223,4.75,0.9561

F - Slight hop stickiness, medium to heavy body. Plenty of effervescence.  O - Perfectly balanced IPA. This is actually a step back from the now famous uber-aggressive New England IPA style.

Society & Solitude #4,"On tap @ the farmhouse poured into a tulip. My first review in a while, but this was stand out enough to make male the effort.  Pours a hazy orange/yellow color with a small white head and some nice thin lacing. Nose is fruity, citrus, and a bit piney.  Taste is bitter, but well balanced, very chewy and creamy with a nice full hop character- fruity and rich on the start and bitter and sweet on the finish. Excellent.",0.7028323913801373,4.5,0.9559
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2008 sticker date (2010 bottling). No bottled on date. Opened on March 7, 2011.  A brilliant ruby red with a one finger raspberry-stains pink head that dissipates to a ring about the glass, saying, ""Here. This is what you came to drink. I found it.""  Juicy raspberries, citrus, a nice acetic acidity. Faint brett. Raspberries and raspberry vinegar.  I can never understand how they get so much colorful and piquant raspberry character in this. This is young, and the slightly viscid body makes me feel as if I'm drinking the blood of some yet undiscovered race of raspberry creatures. Instead of iron, their hemoglobin carries subtle traces of funk and oak.   Slightly undercarbonated at this point in its young life. A nice balance of acidity and tartness.  I've enjoyed LP Framboise up until the three year mark, but I always enjoy a fresh bottle of LP for the vibrant fruit character. Unbelievably juicy.",0.6608950639527363,4.0,0.9559
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Finally got to try the white whale. Pours like syrup, smells like syrup. Seems like it should be just a perfect beer, but I don't think TG does coffee as well as the other best breweries. I definitely got some green pepper.",0.5419097853077446,4.25,0.9559
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Celebrating my 1900th review with this one. Poured into a Duvel tulip.  A- Pours a fully opaque black color with a 1/4 inch tan head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a mostly full sheet of surface foam. Resilient lacing leaves large clots behind.  S- The usual excellent synthesis of aromas I've come to expect from Jackie O's BA beers, this time including milk chocolate, coffee, nuts, vanilla and of course bourbon.  T- Chocolate is surprisingly the dominant flavor here, specifically milk chocolate which I attribute to the vanilla sweetness from the barrel. The ABV is dangerously hidden from this beverage since this is something I could sip and sip and sip with reckless abandon. The balance of this is stunning since the sweetness of the malt and barrel slide seamlessly into the roasty, charry finish. Chocolaty aftertaste.  M- Robust and semi-creamy with medium-low carbonation and a full body.  O- Amazing beer as usual from these guys. My only criticism is the body isn't quite as decadent as hoped. The coffee is well integrated into the flavor profile while not particularly standing out, which is fine given the high quality drink that was produced.",0.7018342868337463,4.5,0.9559
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Appearance: Pours fudge brown with a rocky tan head that splatters a showery pattern of lacing  Smell: Cinnamon and Bourbon, with vanilla, chocolate and oak underneath; the habanero provides a powerful blast, as well  Taste: Very hot, with habanero and cinnamon overwhelming; the Bourbon dominates the middle, with some chocolate and roast underneath; te finish is a bit of a melange, with the heat and boozy tones prominent  Mouthfeel: Full bodied with moderate carbonation; considerable heat and warmth  Overall: Tried this side by side with the regular version and, to be honest, I much preferred the regular version; unlike the regular version, where all of the flavors coalesced; the barrel aged version is a hot mess - perhaps another year in the bottle (this is the 2016 version) will help it out  Thanks, PJ_, for the opportunity",0.6558377169587858,3.75,0.9559
Sang Noir,"Appearance - The beer brings to mind blood red wine.  Smell - The nose is rich in the vein of a red wine.   Taste - At The front is rich red wine, sour apple, A little spice, and the booze. The rich flavors carry towrd the back with a warm red grape sensation. Overall profile never seems to fade.   Mouthfeel - For a sour, this linger nicely with the profile.   Overall - This may be my favorite sour.",0.6604964578499749,4.75,0.9559
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Bottle. Pours a very cloudy orange color. Awesome, oily, frothy head. Drapes of lacing. Looks the part. Hop induced fruit purée. Genuinely smells like tangerines. Pineapples as well. All hops; all fruit. Very, very citrusy. Flavor has some greener, grassier elements. It still brings the citrus smoothie parade right down the middle. Clementine and tangerine, oh lawd! Malt is sweet but very well placed next to the hops. Sweet, doughy, pastry maltiness. High carbonation. Medium bodied. Surprisingly not overly bitter.

Sip Of Sunshine,"Definitely a top choice for the beer snobs, with that said New England has so many great full flavored beers that this has become overrated. If you haven't tried it, try it, but good luck finding it, most local stores hide it in the back or put it on social media and all the cases are sold in an hour. Once again great beer but way overrated, try something new!!!",0.5010568797652895,4.5,0.9558
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"2017 Green Pours pitch black like motor oil in the glass with little head. Smell is sweet chocolate. Getting some light bourbon and oak notes, also dark fruits. Taste is chocolate, raisin, caramelized sugar, cherry, with a little bourbon coming through. Thick, viscous beer. Overall, very impressed. This smooths out regular dark lord, and does A LOT to calm down the cloying sweetness of reg DL. Still very sweet, but much more balanced. Not big bourbon notes, would take this down a notch in my book, but overall was impressed. Very enjoyable.",0.671046538434757,4.5,0.9557
Beatification,"Batch 5.  Beautiful clear golden pour with minimal carbonation. Metallic nose, huge lemon juice quality on the palate. This is straight-up citrus, not vinegar. Finishes clean with a big-time mineral quality.   Interesting beer, not complex but an impressive showcase of the flavors it does have. I imagine it being served ice cold accompanying some delicious fresh seafood. Out of that context maybe it's more of a curiosity.",0.7285048369157837,4.0,0.9557
Sip Of Sunshine,"Poured from can to mini tulip. A - Clear copper poured with two fingers of white head. S - Bright hop aromatics pour out of the can, lemon zest and pineapple. T - Loaded with fruity flavors; stone fruit, pineapple and sweet pear. Hop bitterness and booze hid incredibly well equating a smooth palatable balance making a dangerous beer at 8%. F - Pronounced carbonation with a medium body, quite good.  Overall this is one of the tastiest beers I have had the pleasure of drinking in the past year. Great way to start 2018 off right!",0.6700470333585354,4.5,0.9557
Scaled Up,"Overall probably the best beer I have ever had. Poured from a 750ml into a snifter-like glass. Hazy, murky, cloudy yellowish orange. Immediately smells of mellow citrus, grapefruit, mango, strong peach, subtle orange, sweet melon and gentle hops. The taste is a pure juice- peach and mango dominate and yet the beer is so complete. Amazing mouthfeel, very complex and decently thick for a dipa. If you are into fruit bombs, you honestly can't do much better than this.",0.6951216986228508,5.0,0.9557

Peche 'n Brett,"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip.   This beer looks like a peach. Very hazy, with a dark yellow orange color and a very full off-white head. A nice bit of lace marks the sides of the glass.  The aroma is light, sweet peach mostly. There is a bit of an acidic sour note. A bit of funk is in the background, but not much.The fruit flavor does not come through as fully in the nose as I would want. The nose is softer than I like in my sours.  The flavor could be peaches and cream, although it would be a light version. The flavor has a crisp, tart, peach flavor with a bit of cream. There is a bit of funk to it, but this beer is rather light and simple for my taste. The finish is a little bit dry.  The mouthfeel is rather light for a 10% beer. It is a little bit tart, and there is a bit of creaminess, but overall it is a bit tame. The carbonation is light and creamy, with a dry and sour finish.  This is a well-made beer, but as a lover of puckering sour beers, this just does not get there. It has a high ABV and a saison finish, but it does not have the intense sour fruit notes I enjoy.",0.6812996488485984,3.75,0.9553
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Coal black body; thin yet lasting light brown head; rings of lacing cascading down the glass. Rich, roasted grain aroma with some spirit barrel woodiness. Cocoa and bitter chocolate flavor blended with charred grain; alcohol notes are present yet well-tamed and mixed in with the heavy, dark sweetness. Heavy body; thick and chewy; some boozy heat.  This barrel-aged imperial stout exudes rich and tempting notes of charred grain and decadent sweet chocolate flavors. It's dense and rich on the palate with a warm and ever so slight bourbon hint.

Juicy,"From bottle. Pours a dark peach color. Zero head. The wine barrel really stands out in the smell. Oak and dry white grapes. Slightly hidden behind is a nice hop character. Clean elegant hops lead a tart white wine. Finishes with a sweet malty straw farmhouse. My favorite part of the taste. Super smooth with a light, tart carbonation. Leaves the palate refreshed.",0.6775015409813904,4.5,0.9552

Sang Noir,"2011 project poured at about 45 degrees into a teku.  Surprised by the dark marroon pour with lots of brownish head that leaves a bit of a ring around the edges. Smells of tart cherry, grape must, bit of wood and the taste lines up in a similar way with a great complexity that is well balanced and non-puckering. Definitely some cherry and grape notes and a subdued oak backbone. Great carb .   Will happily drink this any time",0.6726620191981462,4.5,0.9552

Sip Of Sunshine,"** 08/18/2017  Can to snifter.  LOOK: Clear yellow, solid white head that fades, but does not retain well.  AROMA: Even mix of light pine and light citrus. Pine comes through more as it warms. TASTE: Hair spray, grapefruit, lime, touch of floral. OK, but not a top 250 beer IMHO. Much like the high rated Alchemist brews I've had, there is way more hair spray than citrus which doesn't balance out for me. Down with the Dank.  FEEL: medium bodied. Starts off a little frothy, but does not hold. Carbonation seems to subside with time/temperature. The beers ""flattens"" as you drink.

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"From my understanding, barrel-aged Dark Lord is only available at the brewery once a year during Dark Lord Day. I've sampled this one at a previous gathering, but this one was sampled during my recent visit to the FFF Brewpub at the 2007 Dark Lord Day. The intoxicating aroma starts filling the area as soon as it's poured. Big vinous woody-bourbon notes from the Woodford Reserve barrels are the first thing you notice then the mochachino notes start wafering along riding the waves of darkness. The intense flavor is amazing complex with lots of dark fruitiness, caramel, and chocolate. The body borderlines on syrupy, but there's more than enough alcohol and bitterness to make it all work nicely. Amazing really. More of an elixir or a potion than a beer. The Dark Lord Cometh!  CHEERS! Beertracker",0.6046470728340201,4.0,0.9551
Thicket,"Bottle courtesy of Joe, just like every other good beer I rate here. Poured to a Cantillon taster. Pours dark purple and slightly murkey with a beautiful bubbly pinkish purple head on top that fizzes away after a minute or two. Super funky aroma, with vinegar and barnyard, serious dry oakiness, and a bit of jammy berry. Flavor is very fruit forward with lots of jammy raspberries, but then the puckering sour hits your tongue and follows all the way down the throat. Acidic and lambic like, dry oak flavors, lacto like crazy, and finishes puckering and dry. Somehow the fruit still shines here, though. Dry, medium light bodied, with spritzy carbonation. This is good stuff for sure.",0.6431687425194631,4.75,0.955
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Bottle # 110 of 300. This bottle has been tempting me ever since it showed up on my doorstep. Thanks isn't enough to maximum12 for sending me a bottle completely unexpectedly.  A - Pours thick and black with about a quarter inch tan head, which dissipates fairly quickly, leaving a thin ring.  S - Reading some of the reviews on here, I was expecting to get a wave of coffee as soon as I popped the cap, which I really didn't get. But as it warms, the aromas really begin to shine. Maple and bourbon are dominant, while the coffee hangs out in the background. There's just enough heat in the nose to let you know this one is a sipper.  T - This is where it's at. Honestly, this tastes like a plate of bourbon and maple syrup soaked chocolate chip pancakes followed by a sip of really good coffee. I have no other way to accurately describe it. It's fantastic and unlike anything I've ever tasted before. I have no idea how they got so much maple syrup flavor into one bottle. But at the same time, it's nowhere near cloying in any way. The coffee plays second fiddle to the maple, chocolate, and bourbon, but there's enough there to tie it all together.  M - Carbonation is spot on. This is thick and silky. It feels like velvet on the tongue.  O - At 12%, I'm trying to take this one slow but it's disappearing way too fast from my glass. I was really curious to see if this would live up to it's lofty expectations. Not only did it live up to them but it surpassed them. I hate to gush but this is just really fucking good. I'll be sad when my glass is empty.",0.6083605548917074,5.0,0.955
Oude Geuze Vintage,Bottle. 2002 vinatage with the red label. Pours a slightly hazed straw color with a nice white head thy is quick to settle. Nice aroma although a little subtle and clean with hints of barnyard and earth. Citrus type aromas like grapefruit. Sour and tart smelling. Very clean tasting with a slight touch of medicinal undertones. Amazing stuff. Grapefruit with touches of tartness. Dry overall. Lemon zest with a slight touch of bitterness like tannins in wine.

Black Tuesday,"Big thanks to Moyman for this beer.  750mL bottle. Pours a pitch black viscous color with a 1/2 inch of brown head. Minimal lacing. The aroma is a whole lot of booze with some nice vanilla, oak, raisins, dark chocolate, black coffee and earth. The taste is boozey with a great chocolate presence that somehow isn't overpowered by the bourbon. Vanilla hints with some caramel as well. Chocolate and alcohol burn towards the end. More warming alcohol at the finish with dark chocolate. Almost tastes like boozey Hershey's Syrup. Heavy, chewy mouthfeel. I'm surprised that the taste is so complex given the very high Abv. Its not just a boozey mess. Probably one of, if not the best, Barrel Aged Imperial Stouts I have had. Amazing beer.",0.6404017176448632,4.5,0.9549

All of the aromas are so subtle but you can pick everyone out.  Taste - Lots of ground coffee, oak and bourbon. I am also getting some spices, vanilla and cocoa. The flavors are really well balanced in this beer.  Feel - Full bodied creamy so smooth and warming from the bourbon.

Feel: solid medium bodied feel with a decent dry finish.  Overall: I think this is really good, the only keeping it from great imo is the toned down noise.",0.7004043622786017,4.25,0.9549

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Picked up a 4 pack of these at Julio's (they only received six 4 packs). Never thought I'd see these in MA! 2018 vintage  A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice dark black hue with a half finger dark mocha head that fades to leave thin wisps and a creamy halo. Decent legs.   S - Aromas of bourbon juice, little bit of fudge, under baked chocolate brownies, warm bourbon barrels, just flashes of warm alcohol, little vanilla, some dark chocolate. Quite rich.  T - Taste is similar to the nose, enormous bourbon notes, slightly sweet, little bit of vanilla. Nice rich bakers chocolate and brownies. Straight up chocolate bourbon juice, great barrel and a little bit of char. Reminds me of the Devils Cut that JLindros reclaimed from his barrel.   M - Mouthfeel is almost silky smooth, light carbonation, really next to no alcohol on this. It could be slightly heavier, however, then it might not be as dangerously drinkable.  O - Overall the bourbon here really cranked up an already really good RIS. The bourbon is pretty much front and center when it is fresh and it's just absurdly drinkable for the ABV. It does sneak up though, as to be expected, but man oh man is it an enjoyable pour.  Serving Type: Bottle",0.6424545716713986,4.5,0.9548
Enjoy By IPA,Poured a nice golden color into my snifter glass. The nose is perhaps a little muted but there is some soft citrus aromas coming through. The taste is better than the nose showed with strong citrus and tropical flavors going on here. The mouthfeel is smooth but there is a little bit of alcohol burn in the back of this. And since this was really fresh it is a better than average beer.,0.697733678343426,4.25,0.9548
Aaron,"Poured from fridge temp into a snifter. Pours a dark murky brown with quickly dissipating tan head. Nose is very bourbon forward, with notes of nuts, grapes, toffee, brown sugar. Taste is amazing. Feels like a 15 year old English barley wine laced with bourbon. Has those amazing bourbon notes, along with caramel, brown sugar, maple, cherries, and figs. Has a syrupy feel to it. It tastes great, but I must say it is not my favorite BA barley wine. That's not to say this isn't amazing - just didn't live up to the hype. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous.

Smells of really strong over-ripened, nearly rotting fruit-- cherries mainly-- oh fuck--- I snorted some of it!!! That was a bad move. I went in for a super big sniff and dove in to far... If you don't think this beer is very sour, try snorting it! Good flavor. Lots of cherries and oak. Nice sourness is balanced and integrated. The body is full with low carbonation. Very high drinkability. Tasty enough to be good, complex enough to keep me interested, and sour enough to scratch that sour itch.

Smell: Holy hell, my mouth is watering. Beautiful buggy smell with a touch of citrus and white wine. Acid, fruity hops, beautiful farmhouse. Delicate but strong and bold. It's not overpowering at all, but it's a rush to the senses.  Taste: Surprising amount of citrus and dryness, oak, and a bit of tropical fruity hops. Acidic for sure, a bit of lacto, dry chardonnay, a touch of yogurt.  Feel: Medium carbonation, lighter end of medium mouthfeel, drying from the wine and oak.

The barrel aging is there, but again it doesn't feel 100% complementary, as the best BA stouts are. You can get so much coconut character out of a barrel w/o actual coconut. If you're gonna go w/ adjuncts, they better mesh well. This tries, but just doesn't get there.",0.674716481029441,4.0,0.9542
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Bourbon barrel-aged Imperial Coffee Stout, with Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee from Stauf's Coffee Roasters in Columbus, Ohio. The pour is black, not too viscous, and sports a finger of brown foam that quickly dissipates. The smell is amazing. I get lots of chocolate and coffee, bourbon, toasted oak, cake batter, and freshly-baked cookies.  Full body with a creamy feel and a perfectly balanced flavor profile. Up front I taste toffee, bittersweet chocolate, and caramel cream. At mid-palate the roasted malt and coffee bitter things up a bit and bring with them the barrel character. The coffee is not in your face, but rather blends in with the other flavors. You know it's a coffee stout, but nobody is going to mistake this stuff for KBS or Big Bad Baptist. The barrel character, however, is quite prevalent. Lots of vanilla and toasted oak and just enough bourbon character to make the flavor nice and rich. You do get a little boozy heat, but nothing that overpowers the flavors or detracts from the drinkability. The coffee carries through to the back of the palate and lingers on the finish along with a fair amount of bourbon and alcohol warmth.  Overall, a phenomenal beer with no traces of oxidation or too much dark fruit or anything else that detracts from the bourbon, chocolate, and coffee. It is easily one of the best ``new beers'' I've purchased in quite some time. I think if the booziness could be dialed back just a bit, you'd have a masterpiece of a beer. I may let my other 2 bottles sit a while to smooth out some of the alcohol (the coffee isn't super strong as it is, so I'm not worried about it losing any punch). This is not a coffee stout aged in bourbon barrels. This is a big, beefy bourbon-barrel-aged stout with some coffee character.",0.6463637295157009,4.75,0.9542
Beatification,"375 mL bottle from batch 5, opened for review #550. Thanks to afrokaze for the hookup, and this was poured into my Duvel tulip.  Beatification pours a crystal clear golden yellow. There's maybe a finger's worth of white foam crowning the beer, and it disappears quickly and quietly. The nose has a good bit of acidity to it. It's very citric, with some bright lemon poking through. There's also a good bit of funk, some earthiness and also pineapple/tropical fruits. The flavor follows suit, displaying the full potential of wild yeast/bacteria. The tartness is perfect, bold and attention grabbing without turning the beer into vinegar. A brief flash of lemon opens the beer nicely, before a tiny bit of oak and some earthy and fruity funk come in and fill the mid palate. The acidity comes back in for a lingering finish. The body is just a little bit full, and the carbonation a little bit lifeless, and combined they're enough to make mouthfeel just feel... off. Despite one or two minor quibbles, Beatification is a fantastic sour beer. It's managed to not only live up to all the community generated hype, but all the anticipation I had for it personally after getting to try only an ounce or two at a tasting a few years ago. I'm glad I have a couple more bottles tucked away in the cellar.",0.6702564475642779,4.5,0.9542
Todd The Axe Man,"16oz single can purchased at Hop & Hound in Bothell, Washington. Just flown in from Minnesota, Canned on date is 08/06/19, two weeks old! Poured in to a pint glass.  Look- Slightly hazy, brilliant, golden honey color. Large, impressive, off-white head that recedes slowly. Solid lacing. Ample carbonation visible in the glass.  Smell- Citrus (tangerine, grapefruit, lemon), tropical fruits (mango, pineapple, passionfruit), pine, bready malt, slightly floral.   Taste- Tangy citrus, tropical fruits, maybe a little melon, a bit of pine and sweet malt.   Feel- Medium bodied with a heavy, dry, bitter finish. Nice carbonation play on the tongue.   O- My first time trying this beer and I don't really get all the hype. Pretty much just a tastier take on a west coast IPA. Definitely not worth the $5.75 I paid.",0.6719088824146059,4.0,0.9542
Darkstar November,"Received in a trade. Batch 2016 and review #3300  A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice rich dark motor oil black with a good almost two finger dark chocolate mocha head that fades nice and slowly to leave a thin blanket. Very, very nice legs as well.  S - Aromas of chocolate fudge brownies, cookie dough, vanilla, nice barrel presence, rich and slightly sweet bourbon and caramel.   T - Taste is similar to the nose with pleasant chocolate brownie batter, very light roasted malts, little vanilla and oak. Bourbon is a bit muted as is the vanilla. Whole thing comes across far more muted than the nose, though the alcohol is hidden very very nicely.  M - Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, smooth, creamy, little chewy with the alcohol being very very tame.  O - Overall this was a phenomenal beer...until I took a sip. With how stellar the nose was I feel the taste was just a dialed down version of that. All those great characteristics were there just far more mellow. Really unfortunate, but at least the alcohol was hidden. If the taste was a hair closer to the nose this would be a home run.  Serving Type: Bottle",0.6746557705455699,4.5,0.9542
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"2/28/2018 bottle shared with 5 others. Poured into a tulip glass. Poured a clear golden color with a bubbly, effervescent white head that lingered. Aromas of funk, oak, hay and subtle acidity fill my nose. Not much of a farmhouse aroma here as I feel like the barrel aging did away with that. Taste is divine. Tart, oaky, subtle acidity in the finish. Muted layers of farmhouse here but not very prevalent. Feel is light and bubbly. Almost champagne like. Damn good. Overall, this is an outstanding brew. HF already makes world class non BA saisons and when you toss them into a barrel, they elevate to a whole new level.",0.6877069921200766,4.5,0.9542
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"Not gonna lie - I find the adjectives and emotion behind Tree House’s beer descriptions a bit much (reflect, fluffy, gift, love...all in one beer!) but, no joke, this beer is spectacular.   Call it a pastry stout, dessert beer, an after-dinner-beer or whatever the fuck you want - it’s delicious any way you cut it.  Pastry stout? Yeah, there are no foodstuffs thrown into the mash but this beer is all about sweet decadence. The velvet mouthfeel, ample heft and multi-dimensional sweetness is unreal for the ABV chassis.   Sweet but not overly so - my palate can’t hack a beer that’s over the top and, despite all its decadence, this beer manages to be appropriately roasty with a hint of chocolate bitterness providing just enough anchor.   One and done, for sure, but I’ve never been one to have too much dessert.",0.6552551954976747,4.5,0.9541
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2006 Framboise on tap at TND in SEPA. Served in a long fluted glass. There's no way I could of passed this up.  A- Red. That's pretty much it. A deep medium shade of the color with nothing on the surface in terms of foam. The liquid is rose colored. Some small streaks of foam on the way down, barely anything. This is pretty beer.  S- Smells like something Cantillon brewed up, no doubt about it. All the signature smells, horseyblanket/barnyard, wild yeast strain abundance with some slight oak from the barrel. Raspberry's are the theme here and they are integrated perfectly and huge in smell. This stuff really smells good so the taste should be wonderful.  T- And it is. This is one of the best Cantillon's i've had the pleasure to consume. The sourness is up there with puckering capabilities. Very fruit forward with the raspberries taking the lead with the funk towards the back. I get some oak in between and am left with linering fruit and oak afterwards. No alcohol is detected while it is rather low. This stuff is amazing.  M&D- The feel is light bodied and sour with some slight acidity. The tastes stay with you for a bit. I can't help to pucker a bit when drinking this, but that's why I drink these type beers here. Carb level is perfect in this well crafted beer/lambik. Well I had one tulip and could easily go for another, but with the high level of bacteria in this, my stomach would not thank me.",0.6754100777677271,4.0,0.9541
Black Tuesday,"This ranks up there with Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Proprietor's Stout. Got to share this awesome Bruery's Black Tuesday at a Alchemist Heady Topper tasting that I did in Chicago on 6/5. After the Heady Topper was gone, the guests dragged out the Bruery's Black Tuesday bomber and a couple of 12 ounce bottles of the Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Coffee Shout. Both beers were top of the line brews, but I would give the edge to Black Tuesday. Just a total joy to consume; especially with all my new friends that came to share my Heady Topper Tasting.",0.5228283427046695,4.75,0.9541
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Poured from 12.7oz bottle.  L: Pours pitch black with a small ring of tan head. Dissipates quickly. N: Nose is cinnamon roasted almonds, cocoa, oak, hot peppers. T: Getting big cinnamon up front, chocolate and vanilla follow with nutty flavors. Oak and bourbon are present, but not overwhelming. There is a marked burn at the end by the peppers. Quite complex. F: Nice mouth fell, lingers on the tongue.  O: Very delicious beer. Flavor profile is complex, gets better as it warms. Well done.",0.6396310968995089,4.75,0.9541
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Had batch 1 KBBS side by side with SR71, Assassin, BVDL, DBH, BA Abraxas and a few others not worth mentioning. When sampling back and forth the KBBS stood out above all. Not only did the body dominate but the flavors did not fall off in any way after sampling other high abv stouts. The smell is very similar to taste. Strong Bourbon Maple with a great espresso finish. Best beer I've ever had.",0.6294898196263374,5.0,0.954
Nectarine Premiere,"Had a week ago. Look was a hazy golden orange juice. Very nice! Aroma was fantastic! Strong true nectarine and that distinctive barnyard hay/grassy DG funk. Surprising bubble gum aroma in the background. Taste is thankfully similar to the aroma. Nectarine and funk really shine here! Aftertaste is same, and it lingers. Mouthburst was good but not overwhelming, and carbonation not too strong. Overall, it certainly impressed me. Among the top 5 sours I have had!

Aaron,"Batch 1 Bottled April 2014  Poured into a snifter  A- pours a deep brown color, nearly opaque, with a one-finger foamy off-white head that has short retention before settling into a ring around the glass  S- The two years in a bourbon barrel is immediately noticed, as there is a huge oaky bourbon note on the nose, as well as barrel juice, caramel and woody vanilla. Beyond the barrel, notes of the base beer start to poke through; raisins, figs & maraschino cherries, as well as brown sugar, molasses & pipe tobacco. Undertones of port wine and fruitcake   T- initial taste is a wave of caramel and toffee, mixed with a bold, yet not overpowering, barrel note; plenty of bourbon with a peppery oak note mixes with a charge of dark fruit notes of rum soaked raisin & fig, followed by black strap molasses, cola and caramelized brown sugar. Mid-palate adds an earthy tobacco note, and starts to bring out sweet notes of sherry and port wine. The finish adds one more kick of barrel, with undertones of vanilla and coconut, lingers of caramel and dark fruits   M- thick body with moderate carbonation leads to a thick and creamy mouthfeel that continues into a velvety, silky, slightly warming finish   O- this one just gets better as I drink it, the standard bearer for the style, just outstanding",0.6449565917255797,4.75,0.9539
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Appearance: Pours a deep, hazy amber-red. Well carbonated, nice pink head.  Smell: HUGE, woody raspberry smell. Incredibly intense and sour. Bit of must, leather, wood, and hay.  Taste: Incredibly tart & sour, perhaps the most sour/tart beer I have ever encountered. Huge fruit as well, it is sweet but not unpleasantly so. The wood seems to add a good bit.  Mouthfeel: Very well carbonated, perhaps a bit too much so. Tannins and sugar give it a big mouthfeel  Drinkability: Drinkable, but I prefer the Kriek version (although this is better than Rose de Gambrinus, which I find to be a bit thin/watery). This one is a slow sipper.",0.6778312430310999,4.0,0.9539
Sip Of Sunshine,"Poured into a pint glass from a 16 oz. can. This brew has a golden hue with a hazy look, with a short lived fluffy white head. Nose is a bright orange-citrus with a resiny tone and a touch of booze. An incredibly fresh and smooth hoppy-malty taste, with lemon, orange, and tropical fruit and a tiny bit of pine and honey, with a clean ever-so-slightly tinny aftertaste. Mouthfeel is dreamy, light, clean, with just a tiny tacky feel to remind you it has booze. Just a superb NE DIPA. Heaven in a can. Way way up there.",0.6869367968288614,4.75,0.9538
Chocolate Rain,"man am i glad my brother is a reserve bruery member....shout out to him (rau71) for this one.  beer pours a heavy 30 weight consistancy, lacing decipates immediately, smells of straight bourbon with a hint of vanilla, taste like a dark expresso bean chocolate stout with hints of marshmellow and vanilla, the bourbon profile is extreme but pretty much what i expected from a 19.5% beverage. This beer is awesome, much better than black tuesday in my opinion and definately worth its hype. Might even be my new favorite, the only negative for me is that can be a little hot and its limited availability.",0.5832181377538516,5.0,0.9538

Black Tuesday,"2013 version, opened too soon, but was jonesing to try it. Incredibly rich and full-bodied, with a ton of malt-y sweetness, laced through with coffee and caramel.

Beatification,"I received this from @bum4ever in a BIF box. It was a ""mystery"" beer and my initial notes were made without knowing its identity. Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. It pours a slightly hazy bright gold with orange hues. The effervescent, ecru-colored head dissipated quickly giving it a champagne-like appearance. It has the unmistakable smell of brett yeast, along with lemon and perhaps a hint of lime. There is also a distinct smell of oak. It's very fragrant. As expected, the taste opens strongly sour with bitter lemon notes. There is also a subtle taste of grape that gives it a small amount of balancing sweetness. As the glass warms you can increasingly taste the oak barrel and it finishes fairly bitter. The flavors blend very well. As expected for a Wild Ale, the feel is crisp and light with lively carbonation, and the 6% ABV doesn't distract from appreciation of the flavors. Overall, this is by far one of the finest Wild Ales I've had the pleasure to drink. Thank you, Josh, for the opportunity.",0.6909918258719828,4.5,0.9538
Sip Of Sunshine,"16oz canned on 2-4-19 (opened 2-23-19). Orange-gold with a slight chill haze. 1"" white head, decent retention and leave behind of a nice lace pattern. Bright aroma full of citrus (oranges and limes) and tropical fruits. Definite big malt bill throws a creamy undertone surrounding the fruity hop notes. Oranges, lime peel, pine, ripe fruits and then a hit of bready malt dough. Classic IPA flavors, delicious. Full body, medium carbonation...big mouthfeel, bright with a long, pleasant, mild bitter finish. Fantastic IPA.",0.6812541044224074,4.25,0.9538
Haze,Poured from a 16oz can into a Trillium IPA glass.   Look is an opaque hazy yellow with a thin white head.   Little bit of peach and orange on the nose. Subtle but good.   Taste is spectacular. Tons of tropical hops well balanced by dry biscuit malt. Hides the alcohol super well.   So good.,0.6668564426219297,4.75,0.9538
Peche 'n Brett,"Shared by JLindros at his Birthday Whale Tasting. Reviewed from notes. Its worth noting this was a yellow cap bottle. There were two cap colors. Black signified longer time in barrels I do believe.  A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a clear peach juice with a thin white quarter inch head that fades to a light thin blanket.  S - Super bretty with very light, super dry peach notes. Faint horsehair and peach syrup. Not quite as peachy as I figured it would be.  T - Taste is well, peach and brett. Light peach juice and canned peaches. The pear comes through as well thanks to the base beer. Again though, not nearly as much peach as I thought this would have. No alcohol at all though.  M - Mouthfeel is sold. Its light and crisp with no noticeable alcohol. Super impressive.  O - Overall, a good beer but not quite worth the hype. I have a few bottles myself and I think Jared just got an old bottle as there really should have been more peaches in this.",0.612437083475827,4.25,0.9538
Green,"Bought some cans from Tree House on 9/29. The beer pours with a murky dark yellow appearance, thick lacing on the sides, and a long lasting bubbly head. Aromas include some sharp hop spice mixed with a nice balance of tangerine and grapefruit. Taste is bitter with piney citrus hops mixed with fruits like the grapefruit from the nose. Carbonation was decent with this drink, but its heavy flavors were made approachable thanks to the medium body of the beer. Overall, excellent appearance with great characteristics overall.",0.7047068035533678,4.25,0.9538
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Alewatcher, nuff said.  Looks like Dl generally does, opaque and inky, thick and viscous. I personally love how Dl looks, it has everything i want in a big stout. The aroma only shows a glimpse of the power this beer has, there is a bourbon wisp but nothing that overburdens the rest of the base beers great attributes, incorporated and building. The flavors have that quick bourbon and oak jab, and comes in some melted dense caramel, with some light dark fruit notes. Rounded out by a mixture of chocolates both milky and semi-sweet and you have the best of the vintage(pre-11) DL variants.",0.6647416236722173,4.5,0.9538
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"Probably the best beer from the Jackie O's lineup.   This one hits with a slight hint of maple upfront, then mellow into a sweet malt stout.

Nectarine Premiere,I had b2 last year and knew I had to get my hands on more. B3 isn't quite as fruity or have the same mouthfeel but nevertheless it's very similar. Best nose on any sour period. Many people comment how you can smell chocolate or coffee or other things and I've always thought that these were more resembling characteristics but this beer really does smell like straight nectarines and nothing else. Beautiful citrus. The level of sour and acidity are damn near perfect. I've had quite a few DeGarde beers and this is hands down my favorite right with Imperial Stone Bu. When I traded for the B2 with the Peach I thought the Peach was a total let down compared to this gem. Totally worth trying at least once.,0.6263642960922277,4.75,0.9537
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. Thanks Big Julius for hooking me up!  Pours like most other Trillium beers.. straight up orange juice, super hazy, not much light gets through this one.. head is big frothy and bold, leaves lots of lacing and a good amount of retention. The epitome of a New England IPA by looks.  Aromas.. straight up PINEAPPLE JUICE! Tropical fruits all over but pineapple is the big guy here, citrus, watermelon, grapefruit, mango are all potent and ever present. Perfect aromas, so tropical and juicy.   On the tongue is more tropical fruits, lots of grapefruit, citrus, tropical fruit, pineapple, finishes ever so lightly bitter. A little sweet. Medium body, low carbonation.   Loved it.. I swear they add juice to these..",0.6442146561773628,4.75,0.9537
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),I had this with a very nice cigar and they both complimented each other very well. The thick sweetness of this stout tamed the cigar burn in the mouth. It was almost like peanut butter and jelly. Very good stout,0.5966715800874947,4.5,0.9537

Enjoy By IPA,"A: [4.25] The bottle lists the ABV (9.4%) and there is a best by date 4/20 - duh. The beer is a cloudy amber color with 1 finger of white head.  S: [4.00] Big pineapple and dank notes. Peach and mango.  T: [4.50] Spot on. Mango, pne, dank resin, pineapple, orange rind, sweet malts.  M: [4.50] Thick and coating. Nice carbonation level. The bitterness is just right. It is there and lingers but is not overwhelming or distracting.  O: [4.25] I like the concept of making the name of the beer the drink by date. But it is not just a gimmick - this is a great beer. Tons of fruit flavor and aroma wrapped with dank notes. The body is nice and there is NO hint of 9.4% alcohol. Overall this is a fantastic IPA.",0.6122093198742357,4.25,0.9536
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Pours viscous with almost no head to speak of; yet after that viscous pour, it sits cola brown in the glass with a fair amount of light passing through around the edges. Smell is heavily chocolate forward balanced nicely by a robust barrel character. The coffee comes through as the third most distinct smell. Slight hint of vanilla from the barrels along with some nice balanced roasted note. Taste follows the smell for the most part. Slightly sweet up front and the coffee comes through in the middle much more prevalently than in the nose. The overall taste of the beer is very bourbon county esque with a slight roasty coffee note. Not a coffee bomb at all, though it still manages to peek out independently. Also get some floral spicy notes that is a nice touch. It feels deliciously silky, but it is a tad too light. Something about the beer gives you a watery impression Tonito body but it objectively speaking rather thick and full bodied. Overall this beer is excellent but there is a lack of balance in the mouthfeel that prevents it from being truly world class.",0.7121820676872385,4.5,0.9535
Madagascar,This is batch 2 done at the end of 2014. Not retired! Vanilla Rye wins a head to head vs Madagascar but this is very very good. Not enough bourbon and kind of thinner than I expected. Lots of sweet vanilla smell and flavor. This would be fantastic if bourbon barrel aged for a longer time to give it more barrel flavor.,0.5988221131654006,4.5,0.9535
Coolship Red,"L -- Pours a lovely hue of red with modest clarity and a half finger of rocky white head produced with moderate pour. Very minimal retention or lacing S -- Raspberry jam, raspberry leaf, tart apple, oak, bretty funk, lemon, strawberry, sweet floral. Beautiful and clean -- on par with the clarity of aromas found in Peche n Brett (although obviously very different) T -- Largely follows the nose. The raspberry character really balances out the lacto-forward tartness nicely: it's not acetic nor does it just taste like a fruited gose F -- Medium- mouthfeel, medium+ carb. Flies off the palate quite quickly for the style, which makes it all the more refreshing O -- This is a fabulous fruited lambic, and one of the best naturally inoculated beers I've had, period. Pricing is very high, but it's worth it (cr)  91/100",0.698262587703273,4.5,0.9535
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"I love the regular expedition stout and I look forward to it's release every year. This version is just as good, pours with a similar viscosity, has the same dark cappuccino head, and very similar flavors. So naturally I think that it is a great beer... That being said, there is not very much barrel flavor to enhance it. You get some bourbon notes, and the usual chocolate roasty flavors that come with expedition, but not too much else. The nose is really nice, and you pick up all of the barrel aged aromas, just not too much on the palate. Overall, it is still a great beer...",0.6530209331576384,4.25,0.9534
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"When every one lined up to get their bottles, I headed straight to the bar to get a little low-ball of a terrific beer.  This beer came a mirrored obsidian with a small collar of tan and copper head. There were also a few mysterious wisps of head swirling about the surface.   Smelled of gentle fruity bourbon, dark creamy chocolate, maple syrup, chocolate pudding and a warm, aromatic alcohol that hid behind the bourbon and an oak dryness. As it warmed, the alcohol became very (overly?) prominent, but carried with it a sweet vanilla.   Tasted of pasty, rich chocolate pudding that took root in my tongue and turned it brown (seriously, I checked). Through this floated an electric tingly sting of flowing woody bourbon, fresh cut oak and a Jagermeister-like herbiness. I also got some sweet marachino cherry and creamy oak burps! Never had a stout do that before! Sadly, the alcohol was hot to the point of becoming distracting.   The mouth feel was heavy as hell with a thick creamy viscosity added by a micro-fine carbonation giving this the feel of pudding. Wheres my spoon!   This ones just a trip. The alcohol was a little much and could stand to be aged for a while. Hopefully, FFF has a keg of this sitting somewhere waiting to be cracked in a year or so. A cool version of this would be off the charts!",0.6348405954722828,5.0,0.9534
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,Everything with this beer is great. You can drink it any time in any condition. Very aromatic with a fruity smell.

Aaron,"Bottle gifted from a friend; truly blown away by the generosity. Stored in appropriate conditions for a month or so before cracking it open during the holidays.   Garnet and earthen-brown colored pour with a quick head of white foam that fades into faint wisps.   Aroma of roasted malt, sweet dark fruits, toffee, molasses, oak and bourbon. Light hint of candied fruit and Werther's Original. Malt and oak figure prominently.   Taste is caramel malt, candied fruit, plums, figs, light toffee, cola and booze. Complex cascade throughout the bottle; slightly sweet, bitter with noticeable alcohol warmth. Ethereal winter spices linger on the palate.  Incredibly smooth - neither any rough edges nor does one flavor stand out. Moderate weight on the palate; you can drink the bottle and not have to worry about your palate being smoked. Not as much caramel and toffee as I've experienced in other BA English Barleywines. Hard to guess what the ABV is but I would venture somewhere near 12% - you feel it but it's not near burdensome and it adds nicely to the weight of the beer.",0.6687998175861528,4.5,0.9534

You take a sip - your tongue goes into shock, and your lips turn into a cat's @$$#*@&, But the taste turns, and suddenly it's good... Really good. You go back for another sip to make sure. Then another, and another. Pretty soon you're scouring liquor store shelves for it, but all you can find are their Apricot or Raspberry stuff.

Some sweet earthy hops, and pine behind that. Tangerine and candied apricot behind that. Dry crackers and a touch of sticky sweet malt close this out  M: medium, slightly fluffy mouthfeel with low-mid carbonation   O: I’ve had this years ago, and i don’t remember it being so hazy.

There's a general sweetness.   T - Lots of juicy citrus and other tropical fruits with some oily hop resins on the finish. No perceptible maltiness, yet very low on bitterness for the style. Very flavorful. Some light evergreen notes.   M - Very light, drinkable, and smooth on the finish. Pretty much perfect for an 8% DIPA. I wouldn't change a thing about it.   O - A fantastic DIPA. Very bright, flavorful, and easy to drink. Comes in 12 oz. cans for $9.25 a 4 pack!! I would drink a lot of this if I lived in Vermont. I have no problem placing this one in the top tier of VT DIPAs.

This is flat out delicious. Oro Negro by itself offers a tasty, spicy, and complex stout, but the addition of the bourbon barrel aging takes this stout to another level. Honestly the complexity of the flavors rivals some of the best stouts I've had and beckons Double Barrel Huna for comparison. Incredible! Seek this out if you can.",0.6688972847793496,5.0,0.9532
Swish,"Drank on tap at The King's Head, Portland, ME Served in a Bissell Brothers stemless wine glass  The beer poured a slightly hazed, light golden amber and was topped by an inch tall, frothy, eggshell colored crown. Solid retention. Spotty droplets of lacing coated the glass.  Fantastic aroma. Super fruity and bright. Tropical fruits dominated. Papaya, guava and pineapple came through strongest. Fairly sweet. There was a dank, weed-like quality as well. Touch of lemon. Grapefruit notes appeared as the beer warmed.  The flavor profile was drastically different from the nose. It too was super hoppy but also remarkably pithy and dry. The hops had an intense catty quality. Loads of white grapefruit. Uber lemony. Fairly grassy. The beer finished with an intensely dry and bitter, lemon rind-like quality. Moderately tart. The pithy, bitter notes lingered long after every sip.  The mouthfeel was surprisingly light for the style. Frothy and fluffy. The liquid contained a super fine, semi-aggressive, almost Champagne-like carbonation. Rather odd and a bit disappointing.  I typically love intensely hoppy double IPAs, but Bissel Bothers's Swish was far too dry and pithy for my palate. Perhaps a bigger mouthfeel and more rounded flavor profile could improve things significantly.",0.7169143774569089,3.5,0.9532
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Typical opaque orange juice like Trilliul appearance.   Nose is bursting with fresh fruit. Tangerine, pineapple and an interesting hint of lime.   Palate is fresh citrus won grapefruit, like and orange notes. Lighter floral flavour. A touch of honey malt sweetness.   Medium body. Sticky snd oily. Light carbonation.",0.6736609980275811,4.75,0.9531

Green,"An impressive bubble show creates a meringue-like head layered on top of the cloudy honey colored liquid; excellent retention with plenty of lacing to boot. Smells like a combination of all the tropical fruit juices you have ever smelt.  Tropical juice flavors forward, with mango, papaya, guava, pineapple, lime and orange; stone fruit flavors as well.  Green is perfection. A text book New England IPA.",0.6443086313405365,5.0,0.9531
Todd The Axe Man,"Faintly hazy, bright gold colored body with a relatively thin yet lasting head, a bit soapy, a bit creamy. Powerful scent of citrus and pineapple; orange, lemon; very light note of light grain. Huge juicy flavor infused with a striking yet balanced hop bitterness; grapefruit; subtle cracker notes. Medium bodied; crisp and dry with a bit of alcohol dryness, too.   An outstanding beer with a nice ABV punch, balanced and delightful in all respects.",0.7498839431563084,4.25,0.9531
Swish,"16 oz. can from the source poured into a snifter 2 days after canning.  A= Really hazy, glowing orange when you shine light on your glass. Quickly receding foamy white head. Sticky lacing.  S= Big pop of citrus including grapefruit, rind, zest, dank resinous earthy hops, and tropical fruit aromas.  T= Get citrus the most mostly grapefruit and lemon rind followed by a deep resinous finish. Good amount of bitterness that is pleasantly balanced.  M= Moderate carbonation and a medium body.   O= Really like this, worth the effort to get, find it to be worthy of its high rating. Very exceptional aroma and hop flavor, strong but not palate destroying. Plays nice and is easy drinking for a IIPA.",0.6995276397276564,4.75,0.9531
Thicket,"Pours a deep, rich maroon/purple with a loose, foamy and vibrant pink head that provides some lacing while drinking. The nose is tangy and deep, but surprisingly has more of the earthy blackberry vine notes upfront compared to the pungent blackberry fruit notes. The nose evolves with some warmth as the acidity takes over. While chilled, the taste is modest blackberry with some funk and grain - but is generally overtaken by tart blackberry when warms. Regardless of temperature, the beer is punishingly dry and has tremendous fruit character. There are some nail polish qualities and alcohol, but both are minimal. Very tasty beer and I surprisingly enjoy it more chilled.",0.7006230754639834,4.5,0.9531
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"Pours an oily dark brown with a fat finger of foamy, dark tan head. Decent lacing.  Big roasted malts and even bigger chocolate in the nose. Light cream as well. It’s like sticking your snout into a glass of Hershey’s syrup.  Similar tasting. Super syrupy chocolate, but with dark bakers chocolate bitterness, too. Maybe a touch of breakfast-roast coffee and other roasted malt qualities, but they’re buried by the chocolate here. Definitely has a milk stout character. There’s also a hint of stone fruit in the finish and the slightest kiss of alcohol burn.  Fairly full bodied feel — more milky than creamy — with a pleasant, slow-building fizziness cutting through.  Honestly, this is too heavy handed on the chocolate for me. If you’re looking for straight-up chocolate decadence, though, this is the beer for you.",0.6361619100021169,4.0,0.9531

Green,"This was a draft pour from their new Charlton location.  Appearance: The body is a medium shade of orange and the head is short and creamy textured with an off-white appearance. The head doesn't stand very tall but it has decent retention and lacing.  Aroma: The aroma is very catty with a scent of alcohol.  Taste: Just like the namesake the beer does taste very green. It has a grassy taste with a bit of cut leaves and some aloe flavor. It has a bit of alcohol taste to it.  Mouthfeel: Mild bitterness and a bit of a dry hop bite giving it a touch of roughness at the back of the throat. Otherwise the beer has a smooth character. Drinkability is hampered a bit given the presence of alcohol.  Overall: It's a good beer with a lot of unique flavors, for better or for worse. The flavors are very grassy so I wouldn't recommend it to a person who is looking for something with pine or fruit hop flavors. I probably wouldn't pick it up at Tree House again because it is also a bit rough around the edges, but it is good enough that I would gladly drink one that I already had on hand or one that a friend gave me.",0.6814842221444205,3.5,0.9529
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"So glad I got to try this. A truly well made and delightful brew. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tasting glass. (Because I split with a buddy to give him the pleasure of trying too) This beer pours out pitch black with a thin caramel colored crown on top. The smell is beautiful with the bourbon and oak and the taste does extremely well in calming and taming the regular with notes of bourbon, thick chocolate and absolutely amazing barrel qualities. The barrel qualities are what truly impressed.  *gotta make some edits. Last time I had this was after a pretty big beer break for me, and even the beer I did have, weren't big. Having it now, after a week of Abyss variants, some new Prairie Stouts, BA Ten Fidy, Deths Tar, Cafe Deth, etc. this year just isn't up to standards of others of the style. Still possesses the qualities in this review, but now seems somewhat flat with no bounce, underwhelming and a little one dimensional. I still don't want to believe this.

Enjoy By IPA,"I really enjoyed ""Enjoy by 10.31.18"" from Stone, ABV 9.40%, IBU 90. I liked it better than the unfiltered Enjoy By, which had a garlic undertone (this one doesn't).  Look: Amber color, bubbly, with an inch thick white head  Aroma: grapefruit, mango, pine resin  Flavor: It's grapefruit, mango, floral hops notably significant pine resin, and despite the ABV 9.4% there's no alcohol taste.  Feel: Light-medium, fresh and juicy and refreshing",0.6700525396960477,4.5,0.9528
Black Tuesday,"2013 version, and still tasting quite hot from the booze. Have had this fresh, and expected some more of the nuanced flavors to come through more, and get less alcohol, but no dice. I still get bourbon over anything else, but coffee and chocolate are certainly there as well. A wonderful beer to share with friends.",0.5819627393007031,4.5,0.9528
Swish,"Pours a hazy yellow-orange color with a nice white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Smells of citrus and tropical fruit, with little hop smell.

A masterpiece.",0.7285059848503496,4.25,0.9528
Beatification,"We decided to do a segmented vertical at ffej of july this year. I brought my Batch #2, Deuane brought his Batch #3, and Jwiss22 brought his Batch #5. This review will be a combination of the three.  A - Pours hazy golden yellow with a small half finger tall white head leaving very small streaks of lace down a small portion of the glass.  S - Smells of lots of acidic sourness, white grape, lemons, green apples, oak and some barnyard funk. Batch #2 is mostly sourness at this point, Batch #3 has all the flavors in near perfect balance and Batch #5 is probably the ""fruitiest"" of the three.  T - Starts off with an intense sourness that never really goes away. The fruit - the lemons, grapes and apples from the nose - combine with some musty barnyard funk and dry oak to offer some contrast to the sourness but they can only do so much. Finish is quite dry, lingering on the palate long after consumption.  M - All three batches possess a light body with intense flavors and moderate to moderately low carbonation. Very sour, dry finish on all three batches.  O - All three of these were really good. My Batch #2 was definitely the most sour, Batch #3 was probably my favorite since it was the most balanced and Batch #5 just tasted a little raw compared to the other two. This was a seriously delicious test.",0.6795704861097445,5.0,0.9527
Nectarine Premiere,"I think this is a little over hyped, but is still very solid. The most outstanding factor is the deep nectarine juicy-ness of the beer. I mean it has the essence of jammy.

Black Tuesday,"Appearance: Nearly pitch black but still displays some ruby highlights; the head is rather modest but that is not surprising for a 19.2% ABV; minimal lacing  Smell: Bourbon and chocolate, with undertones of vanilla and marshmallow; boozy heat  Taste: Chocolate, up front, with the Bourbon, vanilla, marshmallow and coconut building in the middle; quite boozy, after the swallow, with dark fruit, coffee and maple flavors that linger in the finish; the aftertaste has some sweet cherry tones, as well  Mouthfeel: Full bodied with low carbonation; tons of heat  Overall: I had this once before and remember it as being way to big and boozy so I was surprised to find that the 2012 bottling (with the benefit of of some time in the cellar) was really quite flavorful and complex without overwhelming the palate  Thanks, BigTomZ, for the opportunity",0.689682009681885,4.5,0.9524

The beer is light and easy to drink and somehow, seemingly simultaneously has notes of sweet and sour cherry, tartness and a woodiness to the beer that helps smooth things out.

Taste follows the aroma, very hoppy; a good amount of orange but with a substantial Resiny pine presence. A subtle biscuit malt profile supportsbthe hops, moderate bitterness. Medium-light body, moderate carbonation. Overall a very good beer. Wonderful aroma and great taste; I'm a big Trillium fan but this just didnt do it for me.

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"This is the 2016 version. The beer pours pitch black with almost no head on a very vigorous pour. There is a small ring left, which still coats the glass nicely leaving a small lacing.   The smell is huge. It's bourbon, chocolate, something nutty and sweet, spices, alcohol, and more depth and complexity with every smell.  The taste is as complex as the smell. It hits you with bourbon and alcohol. Then a nuttiness comes through that's immediately overtaken by a chocolate sweetness. At the end the spices and cinnamon hit hard leaving a hot, spicy aftertaste that's part chili pepper and part bourbon.  The mouthfeel low carbonation and smooth. It's slightly thinner than expected, but not thin.  This beer is outstanding. If it had slightly less alcohol/chili burn and was slighty thicker, it would be unbeatable. As it stands, it's really great.",0.6691042119928804,4.25,0.9523
Chocolate Rain,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a snifter. 2011 vintage  A: Opaque, dark brown color showing some light transmission at the edges. No foam head develops and no lacing remains on the glass. Fine brown sediment settles out.  S: Concentrated chocolate syrup that gives an impression of overt sweetness to come. Boozy vapors are profuse, heady, not leaving much room for some of the finer details of oak and spirit-aging.  T: Begins sweet, with a medley of overpowering dark flavors that begin predictably chocolatey before revealing considerable plum fruit. Cloying alcohol reigns throughout the profile. The finish is nutty, tasting distinctly of walnuts. Wood influence is not well-represented, athough vanilla extract seems to go hand-in-hand with the booziness.  M: Thick viscosity, very hot and syrupy on the palate, with moderate carbonation.  D/O: Impossibly extreme, though focused, stout that effortlessly overwhelms the palate with booze. While remarkable in some respects, it proves extremely fatiguing upon the palate. To paraphrase another drinker present at this tasting, it is easier to drink straight bourbon than this beer. Let's not be hasty--although the sentiment is not completely unfounded. This legendary project beer is best taken in small doses, or with a decadent dessert to help cut the alcohol.",0.6961662617582166,3.0,0.9522
Chocolate Rain,"Mixed opinion. Have been waiting to try this for years. Bought 3 and will try out over at least 9 Years. Beer #1: Beer had outstanding nose and flavor, and is easily considered an excellent beer. Appearance was fine and head/lacing consistent with an almost 20% ABV. Very disappointed in mouthfeel... had expected something full and rich and instead a bit hot (understand), very thin (don’t understand) and even a touch astringent. Hard to believe it’s a Double IS. Almost a mix of Black Tuesday, Vanilla, nibs... and Sang Noir. It’s not going to get any thicker or creamier... so much less excited about aging. A very delicious beer... just not my style for body.",0.6484012913030237,4.5,0.9522
Beatification,"12.7oz bottle, batch 5, generously shared by theredflame. Thanks Jason!  A: Pours a light gold with a decent white head.  S: Fresh lemons, slight apricot, wheat, plenty of acidity.  T: Light honey, puckering lemon, a mild herbal quality (pine?), a bit of vanilla.  M: Light-bodied, moderate carbonation.  O: This is a very bright, lemony blend. I would have liked more funk but this is still good. I like Consecration better, though.",0.6741218832146677,4.25,0.9521
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Bottle into tulip appears black with brown head thats quick to fade  Aroma is quite fudgy out the gate smelling of chocolate, bourbon, caramel and vanilla.  Taste is smooth chocolate, caramel, oak, vanilla, toasted coconut and even almost a little marshmallow sweetness. The aftertaste is boozy bourbon, anise, earthy char to tobacco and coffee.  This is a super rich, thick and chew brew that coats the mouth and persists. What a friggen show stopper that encompasses pretty much everything I love about a nuanced barrel aged beer. At ~3% more alcohol than its nonbarrel aged self, this drinks more like its 8% abv or less. Shit, I want more of this in my life.",0.6272216670034244,5.0,0.9521

Black Tuesday,"Have been saving this one for the perfect snow day. Hence one arrives unexpected yet very welcome.  Complex aroma with strong notes of aged chocolate and alcohol followed by a soft vanilla presence and faint caramel.   Has been quite a while since I've had a beer of this heft, and must say I was unprepared for the frontal fusel alcohol assault. After regrouping and digging in, waves of sweet and dark chocolate were felt, followed by an array of maraschino cherry, black grape, vanilla, spice cake, grain and molasses flavors all slow down the throat.  Syrupy and heavy of course, but quit yer whinin'.  An intricate and challenging brew that takes a few dives to reach its depths. I recommend enjoying every moment, but don't forget to take your time while ascending for air.",0.6694369992664897,4.5,0.952
Second Fiddle,"16oz can. Pours a slightly hazy brownish orange with over an inch of fluffy head. Good amount of lacing. The aroma is lots of grapefruit and pine along with floral notes and more citrus. The taste is a nice blend of the citrus and pine. Grapefruit is the most noticeable fruit flavor, but there is some berry and tropical fruit notes as well. Good deal of malts towards the end with a piney and grapefruit finish. Medium body with a dry mouthfeel. Some alcohol heat. Pretty balanced, all things considered. Worth seeking out for sure.",0.7047408499121818,4.25,0.952

Overly sweet, sugary and dark fruit.   F: Medimum body, wich was about the best attribute the beer had going for itself.   O: The 17 vintage does not live up to past representations of the beer.

The smell out of the can was a little more pleasant that out of the glass. Got a little more of an apricot smell at first but then had hints of onion and sweat. Found this to have a bit of an ashy flavor, not unpleasant surprisingly enough. Also some hints of onion in there. Still had a juicy feel and carbonation was spot on. Definitely a fan of this beer!

Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"I'd been looking forward to this for quite a while and, although there were some unexpected things about it, it didn't disappoint. Poured from a 12.7 ounce 2017 bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip. Very dark brown color (would've said black but near the end you can see it's brown) with a small beige head. Smell has a very strong bourbon presence and a sweetness but not specifically maple. Ditto on the taste but with some vanilla and dark chocolate notes. Feel was pleasantly light; I'm wondering if this is why this is an American Porter but the Vanilla BBBM is an Imperial Stout; I've got one of those for future consumption so we'll see.",0.627379376107802,4.5,0.9518

Pours a hazy golden orange w/ a fluffy white head that leaves behind some spotty lacing.  Aroma is tart, oaky, funky w/ a big blast of juicy peach. Brett yeast is the predominant aroma.  Taste is sour/tart with plenty of lactic acid. Dry oak. Subtle sweet peach sweetness lingers on the palate. Malt profile is neutral, slightly grainy. About as close as I've come to a beer that tastes and smells like fresh peach juice. Absolutely no trace of alcohol; pretty impressive for 10% ABV.  Mouthfeel is crisp and light, finishes very dry.

Flavor is stupidly hoppy like and instantly relatable to any other HF IPA. Flavor starts with a Double Citra resin and pulpy hop flavor mid palate and finish with a juicy and tropical fruit Double Galaxy sweetness.

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Served on-tap @ the 2006 Dark Lord Release Party.   Pours a thick, syrupy black..the head is modest and a dark caramel color. Aroma is heavy coffee, oak, vanilla, and chocolate, with some alcohol creeping out as well. There's definitely an oaky, bourbon kick to it, but the bitter chocolate and roasted coffee flavors still take the stage similar to the bottled Dark Lord. Amazingly balanced between the bold hop character and the array of tastes..just fantastic. Mouthfeel is expectedly thick, and very coating..yet smooth as velvet. Remains remarkably easy to drink for a beer of this magnitude.  Felt privileged to try this one.",0.693057005686312,4.5,0.9516
Peche 'n Brett,"Appearance - The beer was golden yellow with white bubbles crowning the glass.   Smell - Wow! This smells like fresh peaches. Very nice!  Taste - My initial impression is tart fresh peaches. The funk enters with a certain level of grassiness. Toward the back, the taste leans dry from the oak with hints of sour Granny Smith apples.   Mouthfeel - The carbonation is aggressive, brushing away the sweetnees until only dry notes are left.   Overall - The peaches here are great. I am not a big saison guy, but this is great.",0.6591795233652528,4.25,0.9515
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"I’ve had Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier many times and I just had it again. I think it is a great Hefeweizen. I love it for its balanced and moderate but distinct flavors and for being such a classic Hefewezien and yet such a great beer.  Look: golden hazy hue with very thick (three-inch) white foamy head.  Aroma: The aroma is wheat, yeast, banana and maybe a tad citrus.  Taste: the usual Hefeweizen flavors wheat, yeast, banana, a little bit cloves and maybe a hint of orange but the flavors are just really well composed and well balanced.  Feel: The body is light to medium and it's crisp and thirst quenching.",0.7207425296024941,4.5,0.9515
Chocolate Rain,"poured about 6oz from a bottle.   A - Deep space black with brown highlights and a thin brown head, no lacing.  S - Boozy with massive dark chocolate notes. Molasses, vanilla, and dark fruit also contribute to the aroma.   T - Rather copious amount of sweet milk chocolate and vanilla with toffee and dark fruit. The alcohol is there, but it doesn't seem like the 18.5% ABV. It is just so chocolatey, but not overly sweet.   M - Medium with lighter carbonation and an alcohol burn at the end.   O - This was excellent to try and I highly recommend it. I'm not sure I would buy it, but it was awesome!",0.6475272120609032,5.0,0.9515
Black Tuesday,Bottle: Poured a clear light dark black color ale with a nice dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of rich thick black chocolate notes with light molasses and some roasted malt is quite sublime. Taste is an incredible mix of thick black chocolate with some roasted malt and some light molasses. Body is quite full with good carbonation and surprisingly no alcohol is easily apparent. Light oak and vanilla notes can also be detected. I was expecting somewhat of a messy overly sweet beers bit this is actually very smooth with plenty of complexity.,0.7029948833221898,4.75,0.9515
Beatification,"Recent batch obtained in a trade and poured into a snifter. It pours a goldish color with small amount of head (fades quickly too). The smell definitely has barnyard funk, yeast, apples, grapes, pears, oak, etc. The taste is pretty tart with a small amount of sweetness on the back end. Has medium body with decent carbonation. Overall, this is a superb offering from RR and worth seeking out for sure; you will not be disappointed! Cheers!",0.6720306652105748,5.0,0.9515
Juicy,"Appearance: With a nice hearty, vigorous pour, the beer produced about a 2.5 finger of soft, white foamy head. About half of the foam laced the glass after about a minute or two of sitting.  Aroma: It smells of wine barrel, oak, tart cherry and other fruity aromas.  Taste: On the first sip, I pick up some tart funk, some straw, some wine barrel. At the very end of the sip, there is a really subtle, slight bitter finish. It is really refreshing and enjoyable.  Mouthfeel: It seems to carry a lower carb feel to it, but it works for me  Overall: This lived up to the hype for me. It was a really good, enjoyable beer for me. I like what the wine barrels did to the overall taste of the beer. Thanks to jhavs for making this one happen.",0.6727204866103526,4.5,0.9515
Mastermind,"Canned on 2/21/19  Pours a deeply hazy dulled lemon gold topped with a finger or so of creamy white head; retention is very good, and results in a thin plastering of consistent lacing all around the glass, as well as a light collar of foam.  Aroma presents big notes of smooth herbal sweetness with a light citric touch; bits of orange zest, passionfruit, lemon/lime, and something resembling dank aloe tones; unique, in-your-face, but very appealing and smooth.  Taste bursts with orange juice, passionfruit, lemon zest, and plenty of subtle dank citrus; that familiar bit of herbal sweetness from the aroma appears on the finish, along with some noticeable doughy, bready malt tones.  Mouthfeel shows a medium body with a lighter touch and spectacular dose of steadily building carbonation. Mostly dry with a faint bitterness across the palate with a fast encroaching juiciness from the mid-palate onward; evolves to one of the juiciest takes on the style I’ve come across to date, and in spite of the occasional thinning, this more than establishes its incredibly high-level approachability.  Ridiculously juicy with a great citrus profile and supporting sweet, herbal dankness; easy to drink any time no doubt, but warm weather would suit this one perfectly.",0.7312471789305991,4.25,0.9514
Aaron,"Fantastic bourbon and barrel notes but this is so refined you might not think you're drinking a barrel aged beer. Caramel, brown sugar, molasses, dried prune, sweet complex malt, grape, milk chocolate, vanilla, orange peel, raisin, oak. Great mouth feel, full and smooth. Glad I got to try this.",0.6389826430291499,4.75,0.9513

Chocolate Rain,"2013 vintage  L - Pitch black. Slight dark brown on the edges. No head at all.  S - Massive sweet bourbon and chocolate with marshmallow and a touch of alcohol.   T - Very sweet with that bourbon barrel which is overpowering everything else. I've had Black Tuesday and I will say that this has some more candy-like, sugary flavors. There's definitely a chocolate presence. but I wouldn't say there is a vanilla bean flavor as I interpret it as more of a sugary vanilla extract which just adds to the overkill of sweetness from the bourbon.  F - I mean, it's an 18.00% BBA stout and it feels as such. The sweetness can get cloying, but I don't care that much. It's very sticky with some alcohol presence, but I expect that with such a gargantuan beer.  O - This is, as expected, a giant BA Bruery beer. It has the roasted notes and alcohol of Black Tuesday, but the chocolate and vanilla flavors are most definitely there to add complexity and even a dessert-like component to this. I think the alcohol taste can be a bit much, but it still is subdued for 18.00%. This is a sipper for sure with enough confectionery notes to add complexity to the base Black Tuesday and make Chocolate Rain its own being.",0.6256196357278629,4.5,0.9513
Sure Bet,"looks and smells terrific with mango and the citra and mosaic hops very profound. initial hit to the palate is what you smell, but it finishes a bit too bitter for my liking. i would have been good splitting this bomber and enjoyed it more due to sweetness and bitter finish. still a great brew, but it's not at the top of my pdubs list.",0.6653048562262687,4.25,0.9513
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Bottled on April 28, 2010.  A- Pours a deep, ruby red in color. Hazy body with a small, off white to pink colored head. Retention is ok, with the thinnest lace sitting on the top of the body. Lacing is good for the small amount of head.  S- Tart, lactic lambic scents start it off. Immediately following the tart scent, the cherries kick in. The cherries are fairly juicy and sweet in smell, but also add to the sour with a dose of tart.  T- Starts with a big cherry bang on the tip of the tongue. Tart, yet juicy, the cherry flavor profile moves back on the tongue and eases a little before the lambic base shows off some of its sour qualities. The lambic and cherry combination is moderate to intense in its sour flavor, but not quite to the level of a gueuze. Towards the end, there is a little drying tartness on the tongue from the barrel. Ends with lingering cherry sourness.  M- Carbonation is moderate, not quite as high as most Belgian sours. Body is light to medium in weight, but the level of acidity and sour makes this one a slower drink that you only really want a glass of.  Overall, it's a little more tart and cherry forward than the regular 3F kriek, but not much. A very good kriek with a very good base of sour cherries.",0.6680780956779974,4.5,0.9512
Juicy,"375 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Reviewed from notes.  Appearance - Hazy orange. A little hazy and murky looking. Nice white head. Gushed a little.  Smell - Citrusy. White wine. Bright and acidic. Hoppy orange with some lemony aromas.  Taste - Very bright orange citrus. Acidic white wine. Grainy malts. White wine lingers past the citrus flavors, but the hops come through to provide some bitterness in the back.  Mouthfeel - Crisp. Dare I say refreshing. Well carbonated.  Overall - Extremely impressive. This review is from the first time I had this beer, which was pretty fresh. I was surprised to find this review after years. It does lose its punch and unique hop flavors after a while, but it remains a good beer.",0.6983107921433837,4.5,0.9512
Society & Solitude #4,Finally got to enjoy some Hill Farmstead brews this weekend while up in VT. While some of the local brews left me a little dissappointed every brew I tried from HF was amazing. One was better than the other and this one was right at the top. Not the best looking brew I've had but one of the most tasty. Strong flavor and keeps on coming till the end.

Coconut B-Bomb,"Sitting on my back deck in the cold, last vestiges of winter. I have a couple more cellaring, so figured to try this before the warm weather hits consistently. 2018 bomber poured cellar temp to a tulip glass. Nose is subtle vanilla, bourbon, light toastiness. Color is black, which pours with a three finger mocha head that burns fast to a ring with lots of lacing. First sips follow the nose, but with stronger bourbon, more toasty coconut,and barrel. Balanced impeccably. Slightly sweet with a full, creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol hides well, but has a slight warming later. Excellent base stout flavors. Not sure it will warm up, considering it’s about 30 degrees on the deck. Buy it when you see it.",0.6652662927012718,4.75,0.951
Nelson,"Best by 04/20/16, Kudos for putting an easy to find date on the label.  Pale golden color with two fingers of head that had good retention before settling to a thick cap. Heavy lacing coats the glass. Dank aroma with notes of tropical fruit and grapes. No sign of the malt. Very much one dimensional in flavor. Dank and tropical with notes of stone fruit. Malt serves no purpose other than being a hop delivery device and no sign of rye and no attempt has been made to add any sweetness. Deceptively light body with somewhat lively carbonation gives the impression of a smaller beer.   A hophead's type of beer. It features the Nelson Sauvin hop in an excellent fashion. An old school type of West Coast IPA that perhaps has been surpassed by more complex style of IPA.",0.6872578342533312,3.75,0.951
Chocolate Rain,"Here it goes. Pours out a dark brown color. Not quite black. Smells absolutely divine. Like bourbon soaked brownie batter with some vanilla. Taste follows suit with dark fruits popping. I'm not sure where that 19.5 percent alcohol is, but it's dangerous. Medium full mouthfeel with a nice warming on the backend. Slightly better than black Tuesday. Amazing stuff if you have a sweet tooth",0.6368157776799741,5.0,0.951
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Pale amber (almost dark gold) in colour with mild sparkling wine-like carbonation. Aromas of lemon, wet hay, barnkyard, paint, black pepper, and mild cherry. All sorts of crazy flavors with this one: lactic acid, horse blanket, wet cedar wood, earth, and mozarella cheese at the end. The palate is quite interesting, as it starts out with medium fullness, but dries VERY quickly. Great sourness and complexity... somewhat Cantillon-like, but a bit more woody. Wow!",0.6629243711232512,4.5,0.951
Haze,"a: hazy (surprise surprise) bright burnt orange color. there is a very vibrant caramel color in here as well which looks just like one of those caramel candies. head pours 2 fingers, solid bright white. it settles to about 1/2 finger pretty quickly though  s: pineapple, mango, and apricot up front - very juicy. behind that is a big sweet malt aroma along with a slightly bready presence, which is making up the backbone of the beer. there is a hint of some herbal hops in here as well as a sweet citrus smell towards the end. this smells juicy and sweet  t: pineapple, kiwi, and juicy melon are the two flavors in here that hit you right away. behind that is a big hit of sweet malts, with just a touch of syrupy sugar that you get in most DIPA's. bitterness in here is very muted, and there is just a tiny touch of pine on the sides of the tongue. the finish is sweet, with just a hint of booze  m: medium mouthfeel, but not as syrupy/sticky as many DIPA's. carbonation level is somewhat low  o: interesting take on a DIPA here, for me. the melon in the flavor makes this quite a refreshing beer. and the fact that the mouthfeel isn't sticky makes this highly drinkable. it is a bit lighter in the mouth, but that gives it a unique quality. be careful with this one, it will sneak up on you",0.6888493046715901,4.25,0.951

Nelson,"I would classify this beer in the category of ""great American IPAs that I don't really love."" While Green Flash's and Lagunitas' IPAs were the beers that turned me on to the style with their complex, juicy, yet gentle flavors, this one is more in the other direction. A hint of fruity flavors with a lot of bitter grapefruit basically drowning them all out, I'm not really sold on the Nelson Sauvin hop as an aromatic. Not a ton going on here, just a lot of bitter, rich hoppy resin.   Now the texture is a whole 'nother thing. Tons of foam, but it's thick and gritty like sea foam, not smooth and velvety like nitro head. Lots of resin and hop oils give a great, sticky texture that sticks around for a while into the dry, bitter finish. But overall, not a beer I need to go back for when I've found so many others I like. Oh well. Sorry to bring down the ratings, boys.",0.6689227781789203,3.75,0.9509

A- Pours a clear, deep golden, with initial, cascading carbonation streaming up the glass. A white, billowy, two finger head caps and leaves butterflies of lace.   S - The nose is and floral hops with notes of juicy orange, tangerine, and lemon rind. Almost Belgian white pepper - yeast vibe too.   T - Resinous and bitter hops dominate, with rounds of flavors (per the aroma - citrus colors) that resolve in a peppery and malty finale. Complex and wine-like. Drink slowly out of wide tulip and savor.   F - Finishes with alcoholic bite, with a dry, warmth from its 9.4% ABV. Glowing and brandy like.   One of my favorite beers.",0.6636934039410937,4.5,0.9509
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Poured from a 12.7oz bottle into a snifter. Thanks Tom for trading this to me.   Pours a thick, viscous black body with a light brown small head that reduces to leave a ring of retention and no lacing.   Aromas are heavy bourbon, vanilla, and coffee. On the tongue is sweet bourbon, smooth milk chocolate, freshly roasted coffee, and delicious roasty coffee aftertaste. Super drinkable for 12%. Medium heavy body with low carbonation.   Extremely easy and tasty, perfect balance of coffee.",0.6554850176310981,4.5,0.9509
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"2017 vintage.   A: Pours black with a cap of espresso-like tan head that recedes to a razor-thin ring. Pretty good retention for the sparse head that’s there.  S: Dark roast coffee, a bit of baker’s spice, a good kick of dark chocolate and vanilla, with a light bourbon accent providing additional complexity.  T: Rich, decadent coffee and medium-light bourbon and oak, along with a backbone of very dark chocolate, roastiness cut through by a bit of vanilla bean. Somewhat dry, which is accentuated by the hefty coffee presence.   M: Velvety, rounded medium-full body despite prickly, medium-light carbonation. Light alcohol heat.  O: A big, delicious, coffee-forward bourbon barrel stout with enough barrel presence to keep things interesting. I suspect that with a little more age, the coffee will mellow and the barrel will show even more—not necessarily for the better, just a different expression. Reminds me a lot of BA Speedway Stout.",0.6808502722453529,4.5,0.9509

The smell is big beautiful orange, mango, tropical fruit, a bit of peach. Taste follows the nose, orange, citrus, tropical fruits, just a touch for dankness hiding in the back. Very soft bitterness. The mouthfeel is thick, creamy, like a velvet pillow of fruit in your mouth. Overall this one of the best IPA/DIPAs I have had, in the top 3 from Treehouse for me, Bright being my favorite.

T - lime is king here. Earthy and floral with a subtle salty juiciness. Reminds me of those lime Doritos. Vinous white grape character with bitter pineapple. Honeydew melon.   F - rich and syrupy. Decadent and heavy. Works well with the strong lime taste to make this a hell of a sipper.   O - so much more lime over the base beer. Wow! One of my favorite Trillium brews. Sweet and sour, hits all the righ spots.",0.6343075042249043,4.75,0.9508
Sang Noir,"Pours essentially like a wine - deep purple, no head, very mild carbonation. Aroma is predominantly a gentle, dry red wine tannin with notes of wet oak, macerated dark cherries & some very subtle bourbon caramel that adds depth. The notes were right on but I felt it could have been a bit more expressive.   Taste begins with a tingling, tart cordial cherry that quite delicious - more oak tannin & earthy dark grape skin provide more of that wine flavor. The bourbon is subtle and borderline elusive, but it is there and adds a soft boozey heat. It isn’t over-tart like so many sours, and offers a few layers. Excellent.",0.6993766036910122,4.5,0.9508

Schaerbeekse Kriek,"750ml bottled on April 20th 2010  Appearance: Pours a dark, not quite blood color. Only slightly hazy. Low amounts of carbonation visibly streaming throughout the glass. Little to no head.  Smell: Tart cherries, lemon rind, musty, acidic, light barnyard notes, and very slight oak.   Taste: Wow, SUPER tart mouth puckering sourness upfront, yielding to flavors of cherry, oak, funk, and lemon juice. Finish is tart and dry with very little residual sweetness. Aftertaste is all cherries.  Mouthfeel: Light and crisp mouthfeel. Carbonation is low. Very refreshing.  Overall: One of the most tart/sour lambics I've ever had. This is a really good kriek and worth a try for anyone that's a fan of the style. Definitely not a starter sour/lambic though.",0.670964713209719,4.25,0.9507

Double Orange Starfish,"L: Deep, hazy orange and yellow hues with an ample fluffy white head S: Oranges, tangerines, calamansi, and subtle peaches T: Initial wave of juice bursting with pineapples, ruby grapefruit, Meyer lemons, and tangerines that is softly underpinned by a slight bitterness and smooth finish - zero malt for me F: Classic Aslin thick and chewy mouthfeel that is amply carbed - borderline champagne in some respects O: Man, what a follow up to Orange Starfish! This beer is effortlessly smooth, flush with tropical fruits, and has an elegant bite of hops that lives up to its billing as a Double IPA. The look of this beer is incredible - on par with DDH Congress St., which is my gold standard for how a DIPA should look. Gorgeous. I'm a bit stunned that the initial reviews have been so harsh on this beer, but to me this made several tactical adjustments and improvements over the base Orange Starfish that produced a bolder, juicier beer that was infinitely enjoyable. I look forward to the next time Aslin makes this when I'll undoubtedly (and happily) unload way too much from my cellar to get another crowler. Great stuff, Aslin - keep it up!",0.6936665210356221,4.75,0.9504
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"2011 vintage, C&C 750ml. Teku glass.  A: Pours crimson with a half finger of attractive, pink-tinted foam, receding moderately soon to a thick ring. Minimal lacing but very good retention.  S: Gorgeous aroma of cherry, red wine, light funk, a bit of grassiness, and dry cinnamon toast.  T: Cherry and funk meld well, with a light tartness building to more of a moderate sourness. A nice red wine character, with light oak in the background. Fairly dry.  M: Medium body and medium light carbonation.   O: Phenomenal flavors and highly drinkable. The cherry is light but still noticeable, and the light to moderate tartness makes this highly drinkable and a good pairing with food. If only this were widely available, I could see drinking this all summer long.",0.7033210676050329,3.25,0.9504
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"L -- Pours a very deep brown body with a scant half finger of pale brown head produced with aerated pour. Head recedes quickly, leaving a small ring of foam around the edge of the glass. No lacing S -- Smoke, maple, vanilla, caramel, bourbon, sugar-dusted dark fruits, dark chocolate T -- Largely follows the nose. The maple is noticeable but doesn't overpower and instead integrates very nicely with the rest of the smokey, barrely, fudgy tastes going on here F -- Big mouthfeel, minimal carb. Nice silkiness to it, much more than the other Jackie O's stouts I've had O -- The major downfall here is the price, at $15/13oz bottle... Otherwise this stuff is fabulous. Just about as good as BA Oro Negro  89/100",0.6354139854227446,4.25,0.9504
Nelson,"22oz bomber poured into two stemless wine glasses (somewhere between a table-glass and a snifter). Pours an intensely hazy peach-straw color with a rapidly dissipating 1 finger white head leaving mild lacing with good moderate retention. Nose is dry piney hops and bright citrus fruits - lemon, orange, and kiwi. The palate opens with fruits very much in line with the nose: kiwi most prominently, with lemon undertones, which then give way to a strong hop body, with appropriately subtle rye notes. Rye so commonly overpowers the IPAs it inhabits, but in this case, it is a perfect companion, adding to the flavor and deepening the complexity, without dominating the palate. A not-insignificant malt presence is perceptible on the back-end of the palate. The mouthfeel is medium, chewy, with mild to moderate combination. Overall, an extraordinary IPA, with a phenomenal level of complexity, though the malt elements are perhaps more dominant than is fashionable in modern-day IPAs. The one-line assessment: a tremendously layered beer, well worth the purchase.",0.7338344105476627,4.5,0.9503

Chocolate Rain,"Look - Black in the glass, motor oil like. Tan/brownish oily top collar. No head to speak of but wasn't expecting any.  Smell - Straight chocolate and bourbon on the nose!

Insane. So drinkable it's scary.   Overall - This is going to be one of the better beers in 2016 for me! Absolutely loved this.",0.6382937410828993,4.75,0.9502
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,A beautiful beer. Thick and delicious. The maple sweetness goes nicely with the bourbon crush. I would live to see this aged in maple barrels afterward. Excellent.,0.6198257325650869,4.75,0.9501
Black Tuesday,"Appearance - The beer poured a deep black color with dark tan bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass.   Smell - The beer had a rich sweet bourbony molasses nose with strong malt overtones.   Taste - I noticed the bourbon first. Then came chocolate, tobacco, fudge, anise, and burnt malts. The warming sensation was start to finish with the rich booziness.   Mouthfeel - Not only did it look like used motor oil, but it had the viscosity.   Overall - I like Chocolate Rain better, but this is solid.",0.6485064402104739,4.5,0.9501
Sip Of Sunshine,"Pours a copper/amber like semi hazy/chill haze like. Bright offwhite head on heavy pour that drops fairly quick. Nose is of mango skin and guava with equal parts earthy grass like notes. First the malt! Having been drinking several trub cans, unbalanced to a point and hop forward prior to this one it caught me off guard. The first thing I notice is Sips sizable malt character. Sweet breed like malt. Mellow juicy tropical fruit melds in to the malty base seemlessly. Mangos, pineapple and melon with sweet and bitter grapefruit notes. Notes of grass and floral are laced throughout each sip but more of a afterthought. Medium body, fat at times. Gets a bit hot as it warms so if you’re not about that it is best to drink quickly.",0.6792927271757412,4.5,0.9501
Swish,Can dated 3/22. Walked away with 5 4-packs (4 for me). Definitely worth the hype. Stands up to the other New England DIPA's. Super juicy. Love the creamy mouthfeel and smooth finish. Still have 3 of the 4-packs left so going to be a great next couple weeks.,0.540178240419583,4.75,0.9501
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"L — 1,000 lumens passed through the glass reveals a deep black body that allows barely any light through. Quite surprising given the ABV. Finger of light brown head produced with moderate pour. Good retention and some lacing S — Nutty coffee, cacao powder, light roastiness, hint of cinnamon	 T — Coffee and barely-dark chocolate take center stage here. Bit of brown sugar, maple, roast, nutty coffee	 F — Amazingly thick and velvety for the ABV. Straight up feels like a >10% stout. Super easy drinking	 O — Another solid offering in the TH lineup of canned milk stouts.   84/100",0.6581649556466034,4.25,0.9501
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Weissbier | German | 5.4% | bottle  L4.5 Excellent head, nice cloud, deep golden. S4.25 really wheaty T4 really wheaty - with a slight sweetness F3.75 smooth.  O4.25 from the world’s oldest brewery - they should be able to make a good beer. They can. Probably the best weissbier I’ve had from a bottle.",0.5890557429416203,4.25,0.9501
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"2016 bottle shared with 2 others - 5 oz pour  L- Jet black with quick fading mocha brown head. So thick it stains the glass brown S- Wow... as soon as you open it, the entire room smells of maple, just tons of maple syrup and vanilla T- Nicely balance roasty malts, barrel and the sweetness from the maple comes in at the end...just perfectly put together F- THICK, best mouthfeel of any stout I have had O- Lives up to the hype. Pretty much the perfect stout. Only surprise that maple was not as strong on the taste as the nose, but I think that kept if from being too sweet",0.6484855707700962,5.0,0.9501
Black Tuesday,"2015 -19.9%ABV  This poured out a dark and slightly murky brown with a thin foam cap that fizzled away quickly. Looks more like a bourbon barrel aged barleywine than a stout. The nose was sweet. Raisins and mash dominate. Taste is sweet as well, but not off putting. Just plain, thin feel. The fact that this is an enormous ABV leads me to believe that it will be somewhat ""hot"", but it isn't at all. I could have easily blindly placed this in the 8-11% range. Pretty enjoyable overall.",0.6579034966632874,4.25,0.9501
Society & Solitude #4,Wow! Now THIS is the kind if IIPA I was expecting based on the universal love of Hill. #4 is the real deal! I found myself halfway through the glass before even realizing it. Dangerous at 8%. I wish this was more readily available as it's one of the best IIPA's around.,0.5283132367919502,4.75,0.95
Fort Point Pale Ale,"Canned on 4/26...consumed out of a Teku. Going to keep this one short. This one checks off a ton of boxes for me...the look, smell and taste are just out of this world (maybe not so much the look as it's your standard NEIPA muddy orange haze). Really enjoying the smell though, its delightful...very easy to drink. Bitter but not terribly dry on the finish. A nice balance of juicy and floral. All around a top notch beer for the NEIPA lovers.",0.6485941704446591,4.5,0.95
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"rowmark making my night with the goandpickitupformebros...bottle number 3. same hazy look as the others and killer lace, smell is way more candied, like the double dry hopped fort point. taste follows, this bottle has a month on it 3/9 date but still drinking nice. less tropical and more candied. smells awesome. tastes great.",0.5657832108689022,4.5,0.95
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Poured into a tulip. An opaque dark brown color with a modest tan head - pretty robust for a BA stout. Oak and bourbon up front on the first sniff, followed by rich chocolate and faint roasted grain. The first sip brought bright bourbon and fudge, followed by roasted grain and some char. Warm on the finish but as expected for a well-made 13+ ABV beer. Feel is outstanding; full-bodied but not dry or sweet. Great beer.",0.6596483498040289,4.25,0.95
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"L: pitch black with a finger of dark brown head S: sweet molasses and chocolate. Not overwhelming barrel though. T: oh yeah, very good. Big sweetness, milk chocolate, oak, and whiskey, slightly hot.  F: smooth and creamy. Easy to drink, just not top notch thickness. O: very good, so glad I got to try it.",0.5936110556745416,4.25,0.95
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Deep brown to black in color with a brown tinted ring of head. Some lacing on a swirl.  Nose is sweet booze, oak, minor coffee, and minor cocoa.  Taste is oak, coffee, bourbon, minor sweetness, a bit of vanilla, and some cocoa.  Mouthful is medium to a bit thin but smooth. Carbonation is low. Finish is semi dry.  Bourbon and coffee and oak. Balance and drinkability. Very nice. The downside is the mouthful being somewhat thin - very surprisingly for a BB stout. Regardless, super enjoyable.",0.6753814081653169,4.25,0.95
Vicinity,Yet another excellent brew from Trillium. Had it at a share and it blew me away. Great aromas out of the glass of fruit and a little dankness as well. Those same flavors were great on the palate as well,0.6482278080611598,4.25,0.9499
Sip Of Sunshine,Excellent dry hoppy IPA that hides its alcohol content well. I really enjoyed its clean finish and complex taste. Easy to enjoy multiple brews as this lacks the heaviness of other IPAs.,0.7128313227892791,4.25,0.9498
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"This one pours a mostly clear golden sunshine yellow, with a small head, and a very small amount of lacing.  This smells like chalky, minerally funk, with lots of citrus- mostly lemon lime and white pepper.  This tastes pretty good, but it's surprisingly mellow. It's a slow sipper, complex, and doesn't bash you over the head with a farmhouse anvil. I get sour lime, white wine, minerally funk, sweaty Brett, and grapefruit. There's much less of a hop presence here than the normal Dorothy, which is not surprising.  This is surprisingly creamy and soft, with a huge level of drinkability.  Hill Farmstead really cannot go wrong for me. This is exquisite.",0.6973900071137265,4.75,0.9498
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"The heat on this is intense on the backend especially as it warms, it is addicting. This is infinetly better than the last two bite of huna I've had and right with. If not better, than westbrook's cake. Overall this is a great example of how jackie os is continuing to turn out some of the best barrel aged bottles around.",0.6223188923298054,4.75,0.9498
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"750 mL bottle poured into a wine glass. 2008, bottled April 12, 2011.  Appearance - Bright pink body. Faint pink head. Nice collar.   Smell - Buckets of raspberry with a nice funk. Not a lot of acidity in the nose, just a bit.  Taste - Bright raspberry, but no sweetness. Some sourness. Some funk. All raspberry in the flavor.  Mouthfeel - Light body, extremely carbonated.  Overall - Strong raspberry and not a lot of lambic complexity. Still very nice.",0.6696871687359991,4.25,0.9497
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"On tap at the Brickskellar last night. The 3 Floyd's rep indicated this was the 2009 whiskey barrel aged version of DL.  The beer pours the expected viscuous looking, blackish brown color with minimal head retention and/or lacing. On the other hand, I can smell this bad boy from a foot away... the nose is profound, showing milk duds, coffee, whiskey, vanilla and considerable booze. This beer just smells flat out decadent. For the most part, the flavor profile replicates the nose, though it's a bit one dimensional and is dominated by sweet chocolate and coffee. The beer is decidedly on the sweet side, and is almost ponderous on the palate. Mouthfeel is absolute perfection and the beer is a huge presence on the palate. The beer feels like spun silk on the palate, with a buttery, creamy texture that is plush, soft, smooth and long. There is a hint of bitterness on the finish, which I think keeps this beer from being over the top rich and sweet. Considering how sweet, boozy and alcoholic this beer is, it's no surpirse that drinkability is not its best attribute. This beer is really more like an after dinner liquer, and it's hard to imagine too many other occasions when I'd want to drink a beer like this. Originally I had contemplated ordering another glass after the tasting, but after my finishing off my 3 or ounce ""sampler,"" I really couldn't bring myself to drink any more. Regardless, this beer is a stunner and is absolutely outstanding.",0.6573334308620035,3.0,0.9497
Sip Of Sunshine,"Had this beer a couple times: first, on tap at the Blind Tiger Ale House in NY, then on tap at a pizza joint in VT and finally in a can from Beer Shop in NY. I want to love this beer. It's always exciting when the beer world baptizes its new classics. I hate to say it, but I was disappointed. That's not to say that Sip of Sunshine isn't good. Its an exceptionally well balanced, dry and clean finishing IPA with enough citrus and pine to satisfy any hophead. That being said, on tap, the beer has a distinct grapefruit character I found obtrusive – more rind than fruit – which, while it doesn't predominate the initial sip, lingers in the finish. Canned, I felt the beer was maltier than when I had previously tried it on draft. The cleanness and dryness which had initially impressed me seemed to have been dialed back while a sticky, pine tar like maltiness dominated.",0.6447933070984452,3.75,0.9496
Swish,"Light, juicy, creamy all in one. Citrus all the way, but a great balance and not just a citra bomb. The combo of the flavor with the depth is damn near perfected. First Bissell experience. Thanks!",0.6972384716537053,4.75,0.9496
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"A - Black and oily, capped with some reddish-mocha bubbles.  S - The nose is an outrageous combination of deeply roasted notes, coffee and chocolate, dark fruit, and oaky vanilla. The booze is obvious as a flavor component, but not as hotness at all.  T - The delectability offered by the nose is fully realized in the flavor. Big luscious notes are leaping from the glass - ranging from coffee, toffee, and cocoa, to anise-licorice, vinous dark fruit and whisky - and covering up the staggering ABV along the way. This is just phenomenally delicious, nothing more need be said.  M - Sticky, oily, hugely decadent.  O - This is definitely worthy of the hype; it is so much better than the base beer that it boggles my mind.",0.6634141261483228,5.0,0.9495
Double Orange Starfish,"On tap, pours a super hazy orange with a nice dense head and solid lacing. Smell is a massive hit of mangos, then more tropical fruits and a bit of spicy herbs. Taste is the same. Feel is a rich medium. This is a stellar beer, maybe my favorite from Aslin, which is to say one of my favorites ever.",0.6723030220228539,4.5,0.9493
Beatification,"Poured from bottle into a Krombacher glass.  A - Gold with a bit of head and bubbles rising to the top. Champagne like effect  S - Lemon, orange, sour candy  T - Very, very sour. Lots of grapefruit and orange. Incredible sour.  M - Light body with lots of carbonation. The sourness lingers.  O - Great beer. One of the best I've had and every bit as good as Supplication.",0.6138725572734209,5.0,0.9493
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"L - label is on point. As seems to be the norm with Jackie O's stouts, it pours thin-looking and with minimal head. Bubbles like cola. A gentle thin head forms and quickly dissipates, leaving large bubbles behind. Color itself is pretty damn black.   S - bourbon and barley. Faint black coffee overpowered by booze and barrel. Wood chips, vanilla smoke, and lactosey chocolate.   T - robust and chocolatey. Thick, full, milk chocolate and iced coffee. Heavy on the cream. There's an oaky bourbon bite and burnt embers. Light cinnamon and spice. Vanilla bean coffee and water chestnuts. Leaves a surprisingly bitter numbness in the mouth. The flavor is so rich and decadent that the biting hops and what I presume is booze burn come out of nowhere.   F - smooth and rich, although not as thick as 11% would suggest. Almost seems light and dainty, making this worryingly dangerous.   O - one of the more balanced and tame JO stouts I've had. Seems to be their highest rated probably because they don't do crazy shit with this one. Authentic barrel flavor and beany coffee.",0.6500651310367116,4.5,0.9493
Beer:Barrel:Time,"The 2017 whale in the flesh. The feature of the night’s share.  Pitch black viscous pour. It boasts a dark tan head, with medium lace that decorates the inside of the glass.. preparing for what’s to come.  Dark fruit, boozy, bourbon nose. It’s not overly complex, but it feeds from the important components of the beer: the barrel, the malt, and time itself (to marinate, of course).  Flavors are characterized by a tobacco intro, with a complex balance of subtle dark chocolate, roasty malts throughout, and smooth booze to finish it out. All the while a sweet fudginess sneaks its way into the backbone of this beer’s amazing flavor profile.  Creamy, smooth body. The mouthfeel is thick and viscous, with a nice burn as it goes down. It’s not overwhelming, and for such a big beer it’s predominantly subtle.",0.7276416600598533,5.0,0.9493
Double Orange Starfish,"azy golden/orange with a creamy white head that somewhat sticks around but leaves behind a ton of lacing.  S - Piney hops along with a decent amount of citrus and orange notes. The pine dominates on the nose, but there's also a sweetness from the oranges.  T - Piney bitter hops up front and throughout along with notes of sweet orange and citrus - but the citrus definitely is more on the sweeter side than bitter. Some other tropical notes in there as well such as pineapple.  F - Medium to full bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Smooth, creamy.  O - Incredibly well balanced NEIPA with great hop and citrus flavors.",0.6817510349741749,4.5,0.9493
Aaron,"Look: Mahogany brown with big fluffy white head. Has medium carbonation. Smell: Sweet maple, raisins, brown sugar, bourbon heat, caramel, and toffee. Taste: Very sweet, maple, raisins, brown sugar, oats, bourbon heat, caramel and toffee. Mouthfeel: Medium full and sticky. Overall: A great barleywine, my favorite one so far. Just a little too sweet.",0.6051369092122009,4.75,0.9492
Todd The Axe Man,"From a 16 oz can (canned October 12, 2017) to a tulip glass.   A-The beer is cloudy and light-honey colored. This not a hazy beer, but it is not close to clear. A short white head fades quickly to a film of foam and leaves only a tiny bit of lacing on the glass. No carbonation to be seen.  S-The aroma is pretty intense and hop heavy. I sniff mandarin orange, some mango, hints of onion, a light pine-like earthiness, solvent-y lemon notes (which I often get from beers hopped with Citra). The hops are pretty dominant, but there is a bit of honey and caramel malt sweetness underneath.   T-The taste is similar but not identical to the smell. Intense, pithy sweet-orange flavors (think mandarin and tangerine) are most prominent. I also pick up lemon, onion, light notes of leafy greens, and a bit of caramel. Medium to higher level of orange-rind bitterness.  M-The body is medium in heft with an active, semi-crisp carbonation. The beer leaves a bit of chalky coating on the palate, but it is very drinkable.   O-I was excited to try this beer upon hearing of Surly's distribution to Colorado (HYPE!), but I feel a bit letdown. The price is very high and the beer just is not what I was hoping for. The hops are a bit muddled and I did not get much in the way of tropical fruit like the description on the can suggests. Good, but not great.",0.6873634804303757,3.75,0.9491
Peche 'n Brett,Had this one at a share. WOW as soon as poured you can smell those peaches. Like peach nectar. Very cloudy tall white head but just huge aromas of sour peach and like a blue cheese funk. Taste was baby food. Tart peach baby food is the only way I can really describe this one. Loved it.,0.5760973782364264,4.75,0.9491
Darkstar November,"Well this is a barrel aged beer loves dream beer!  Ive been sipping this beer on bottles since batch one in 2014...   Since the release of B2 Dark Star on black Friday I have had this on tap a hand full of times, as well multiple bottles now!!  First right off the bat.. Batch 2 is nothing to compare against B1.. B2 is MUCH MORE thicker, creamier, developed, oil slick like mouthfeel, chocolate...   Batch 2 transformation has gone to a Fundamental Observation level of brew.  B2 MUST BE DRANKEN FROM A BOTTLE! The tap was great.. But really it just had much better mouthfeel, and drank way better out of the bottle.  This is a must tick beer!",0.6004329235902394,5.0,0.9491
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"2012. Heavy booze, sweet Dark Lord balanced by some nice roast in both the nose and the flavor. Vanilla, marshmallow, some oak in the taste.

Scaled Up,"pours a hazy yellow, lots of carbonation sticking to glass and rising up. almost like pineapple juice. smell is very soft and citrusy. tangerines, pineapples, and peaches with a slight sweet but dry malt back bone. taste follows the smell exactly, with the addition of the bitterness of the hops and some dank weed. frickin tangerine juice for daysssss though. feel is just like every other trillium beer I've had: kick ass. awesome DIPA, no alcohol taste at all, great mouthfeel, and most importantly great taste.",0.6399876468811618,4.5,0.949
Mastermind,"A very hazy, unfiltered pale yellow. Looks like I peed after a long night of drinking. Sorry. Huge puffy cloud white head.   Smells pretty sour. Grapefruit, pineapple, lime juice. A little bit of floral hop, but mostly citrus.   Taste is dank and sour. A ton of resin. Lots of grapefruit. I also get lime juice. Nice sweet malt background. Not bitter at all. Alcohol not noticeable.   Seems slightly undercarbonated, but smooth, almost creamy, with a dry finish.   Different than most DIPAs I have had. Not sure exactly why or what, but there is something funky about it that I cant put my finger on. That vague aspect is the thing I am not crazy about, but it grows on you. Outstanding overall. If you are borderline on sour IPAs, I may avoid though.",0.6673138577536549,4.5,0.949

Sang Noir,This is by far my all time favorite Cascade beer. This was so well balanced. Lots of barrel character as expected with tons of cherries and wine. The mouthfeel was great and this one will clearly do great with age.,0.6679779934965854,4.5,0.9489
Darkstar November,"500 ml bottle from 2017. Poured into tulip. Pours a dark, dark brown (I can’t say that it’s black), finely bubbled creamy tan head, recedes to just a fine inner ring.  The aroma is molasses, bourbon, milk chocolate.  Taste matches the nose. Chocolate, roast, molasses, rye spice, bourbon, touch of heat. Lingering vanilla, and just a hint of marshmallow. Pretty sweet for a RIS but I’m not knock it down for that. How could I? It’s too good.  Thick, rich and chewy. Slick with light carbonation washing it down.  Another top notch beer from a top notch brewery.",0.6261699267440275,4.5,0.9489
Flora - Blueberry,"Appearance: pours a deep purple. almost black. a small, centimeter or two, pinkish head, with weak retention but some lacing. hazy and with some sediment.  Smell: tart blueberry maybe hinting towards dark fruits such as cherry. oak and wooden flavors. some funky earthy yeast to it. vinegar acidity.  Taste: opens up with some sweet blueberry pie filling. fruitiness extends to possible cherry to dark berries. tartness plays in along with some of the fruit. after initial fruit it is full of earth to funky yeast. ending has some strong oak notes and slight vinegar acidity  Mouthfeel: slightly dry. medium to light. acidic. medium sourness.   Overall: a well balanced and flavorful sour. I don't see this going wrong with any beer fan. great complexity with just the right balance.",0.7095818895902822,4.25,0.9489
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"I had the pleasure of trying both the Oak Aged and Vanilla Bean Dark Lord at DLD 2010. While I would describe the VB DL as a kinder, gentler version of regular Dark Lord, the Oak Aged version is every bit as brutally massive (and then some).   The Oak Aged Dark Lord is simply a more complex version of the real deal. The added wood character slaps you around with yet one more characteristic compounding something that is already very complex.  As with the VB DL, the only advice I would recommend for further improvement is to allow this to mellow out with some age. Being freshly tapped from a new keg obviously doesn't allow this - but it would be cool to have a bottled version of Oak Aged Dark Lord to lay down for a few more months.  In all, I like the Oak Aged Dark Lord that much more than the regular version. I hope they produce more next year!",0.6031359274336952,4.0,0.9489
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Pours bright orange, unfiltered and hazy with a three finger head. Smells of sweet juicy citrus and earthy hops. Taste is smooth and light of tropical fruit and sweet crisp citrus. Peppery mouth-feel. Dank finish. Smooth is really the word for this. This beer smells like the inside of Trillium. Really fantastic, highly recommended.",0.7024269545748393,4.5,0.9489
Nectarine Premiere,"Opaque yellow with a large eggshell blanket.  Smell is very strong apple and fresh nectarine. Peach overload!  Taste is, very simply, exceptionally smooth, soft, fresh peach. Skin and all.  With such perfect execution, it brings me to a point where I wonder, should I just be eating a peach? But then again, if I were to eat a peach, would I enjoy it as much as I enjoy this? No, I think not.  Slightly tart but smooth and dry. Scrumptious!",0.6989645163694261,5.0,0.9489
Green,"I wanted to try this beer before reading any reviews about it. Finally last weekend I managed to go to Treehouse Brewery and get the 'Green'.   I have had a different beer from this same place before. But 'Green' exceeded all my expectations. It is simply the best IPA I've ever had. It is little hasty, smells great and the taste is unbelievable. It is worth much more than what they charge for it.",0.5666507409714967,4.75,0.9486
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"L - tulip pour from draft. pitch black and a little thin. Minimal quarter inch off white head.  S - bourbon first, molasses, more bourbon, vanilla, smells extremely sweet. Very much reminds me of bcbs - I hope it's as thick and rich as it as well.  T - damn. That's one of the best beers I've ever had. HUGE bourbon presence, followed quickly by the maple that I didn't get on the nose. Tons of brown sugar. Roasty but zero bitterness from it. It indeed does resemble bcbs with a satisfying presence of maple from start to finish.   M - it's in no way thin, it's just not as gigantic as I had hoped. Overall it's still above average for an 11% stout.  Overall - phenominal. Arguably the best bb stout I've ever had and certainly in the top 3.  Edit on 10-30-17.  Dropping taste from 5 to 4.25, feel from 4.5 to 3.75 and overall from 4.75 to 4.25. This is NOWHERE near as good as my original review characterized it to be.",0.6390040904707213,4.25,0.9486

It is by far the worst beer I have had in years. I always drink craft beers based on I love great taste. And Stone has never until now failed.

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Pours a very dark brown — near black — with a finger of mocha-colored head that lasts a decent amount of time for such a large beer. Sheets of lacing.  Sweet bourbon with vanilla, almond and cherry notes; brownie batter; hazelnut; and a hint of plum and umami in the nose.  Loads of rich chocolate and strong alcohol burn in the taste. Sweet bourbon hits mid-palate, along with a hint of sherry. There’s a touch of meaty smoke, a little nuttiness and distinct bitter chocolate in the finish.  Smooth, medium-bodied feel on the borderlands between milky and oily, with tight carbonation.  This is a very tasty, dark and robust BBA stout that does justice to the regular Expedition.",0.6710829110176508,4.25,0.9485

(5)  Taste: Toffee, toasted malts, coffee, maple syrup and pancakes, vanilla, rich fudgy milk chocolate. (5)  Mouth-feel: Full bodied with a low to medium carbonation. Thick and creamy.

Coconut B-Bomb,"Another home run by Fremont Brewing. Pours black with minimal head. A sweet aroma welcomes the nostrils, inviting the mouth to join the party. Starts out with what I can now describe as ""typical Fremont BA treatment"". Velvety smooth, with a barrel sweetness. Not overpowering coconut, in fact, the flavor doesn't present itself until the back end of the tasting experience. This one brought a smile to my face.",0.6435101540527773,4.75,0.9485
Society & Solitude #4,"Poured an opaque yellow/orange color with a fingers worth of bubbly white head. The nose had a lot of citrus fruit with pine and spices. The flavor has a ton of citrus fruit with a splash of tropical fruit, earthiness, and finishes with the slightest bit of pine. The feel is medium, well carbonated, and slightly resinous. This beer is outstanding! Well worth all the praise it gets and I will definitely seek it out again.",0.6696705147791868,4.5,0.9485
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Lots of black, brown head 1/3"" like most of the Eclipse beers. Aroma was bourbon forward in a good way. A lot of vanilla there, plenty of chocolate.  Lots of wood bourbon and vanilla. Good roast and char. Carbonation nice and soft. Every year is reliable. The best version they make every year for sure.",0.6220813158762827,4.5,0.9485

Sang Noir,"Delicious and straight forward sour beer.  Pours a cloudy dark red beer. Forms very little foam at the top. Smell is yeasty, funky, sour. Taste is typical of Cascade Brewing: very sour and a bit over the top. This beer has to be shared, as all other Cascade beers. Body is medium thickness, and even though a couple glasses can be enjoyed, it is better to share this one. Keep anti-acid close by.",0.6521864612630811,4.5,0.9485
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Pours a nice ruby with a pink head. Clearer than most lambics. Nose of heavy leather and cherry, cranberry, and strawberry, with tropical notes. I know it has raspberry in it, but I'm just not getting that on the palate. Doesn't matter though; this beer is delicious. Starts with a citrusy strawberry flavor. A slight hint of sweetness enters, and leads to a tart jolly rancher finish.",0.6436210584088468,5.0,0.9484

Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,"L: Pours hazy golden with an inch of head that settles nicely  S: Strong citrus notes and piney. You can tell it's a strong IPA.  T: Very hoppy and very piney. Pineapple hints come out stronger the more you drink and pretty bitter. Can still taste the alcohol but not as much as I expected for having such a high ABV. Very good and refreshing.   F: Light, a little spicy from the alcohol and medium to high carbonation.  Overall very delicious and goes with just about everything. You'll want to drink a few in one sitting but the high alcohol will keep you from it. Quintessential Imperial IPA and does everything it's supposed to.",0.6731632825742873,4.5,0.9482
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Sampled at the 2009 Great Taste of the Midwest  Pours like liquid sludge, when I was finished with this I couldn't even pour the remaining few drops out because they were stuck to the walls of the glass like maple syrup. Huge dark fruit nose just like regular Dark Lord, with the oak also being prominent. Taste was very sweet, the oak stands out and unfortunately has a bit of a harshness to it, so I couldn't rate the taste a 5. Full bodied and thick, I prefer the regular Dark Lord to this version though just because of the harshness. My 3 oz. was more than enough to satisfy.  UPDATE 4/26: Had a chance to try the newest batch of this beer and I must say, it was MUCH better this year. The harshness from the oak was gone, and all the flavors melded together very well. I'm still not sure it is an improvement on the base beer, but it is good enough that I have to bump the taste score up to a 5",0.6330676742490634,3.5,0.9482
Nelson,"BBD 6/18/16. Pours a hazy gold with a touch of amber. Outstanding head volume, world class lacing and retention.  World class nose of tropical hops (mango, pineapple), citrus (orange) and a strong dank background over a touch of biscuit.  Heavy light body with a smooth texture that has an oily slick element. World class carbonation with a nice effervescent middle that coats the tongue and a finely bubbled prickly finish.  The flavor profile is borderline world class. Complexity is a bit weak, but the intent is to showcase the Nelson Sauvin hop and that is done in a world class fashion. Balance is perfect for the objective as a subtle cracker biscuit sweetness arrives in the middle to contrast a tasty bitterness that is quite mild for the style. Hop flavor is the name of the game with this one. The flavors of the nose all arrive...citric followed by tropical as the sweetness of the middle allows the tropicals to shine. Then a significant dankcentric element takes command and holds through the finish. The finish hints at dryness initially, but makes a lingering flourish underneath an amazing blend of tropical and dank hop flavor.

Peche 'n Brett,"Bottle, 2013 release that slightly gushes out, poured into a tulip glass. Beer pours a hazy golden orange with two plus fingers of billowing fluffy off white head. Head sticks around for a few minutes before slowly dissipating leaving thick swatches of lacing.   Nose is sweet ripe peaches, biscuit and grain sweetness, earthy and herbal notes.   Taking a sip, brett forward, earthy, and herbal bitterness, light funk, mellowing to sweet peaches. A bit of toasted biscuit malt sweetness. Finishes very dry, with a light lingering peach flavor.  Light body with very fine carbonation. Very refreshing, leaves the tongue very clean and ready for the next sip.",0.6549236189149644,4.5,0.9481

Alcohol is apparent, but the overall experience is juicy, fresh, and soft. Really nice as always. Amazingly quenching, soft palate that comes off as mango, white grapefruit sorbet.

Nelson,"On tap at a liquor store.  Pours a hazy sunshine gold. Nice white head.  The aroma starts with light rye which pokes through spicy malt and sharp, citrus hops.

Fort Point Pale Ale,"CANNED ON 05/09/18  Pours an opaque peachy haze topped with a pillowy layer of white foam. Fragrant tropical hop saturated nose...mango and apricot slices, grapefruit, pine needles, and a faint leafy herbal spice. Heavy Citra hop flavors - bold and fruity leaving lingering oily resins on the tongue. Peach, mango, zesty citrus, pine sap, and a general fresh hop earthy greenness. Smooth and frothy, fairly heavy for an APA, but stays drinkable thanks to a super crisp finish. Good stuff...essentially an IPA.",0.6816958919372146,4.25,0.9477

It is topped with less than an inch of tan head that leaves no lacing.   The aroma is citrus and pine.   It has a nice citrus flavor. For some reason orange jumps out at me. The finish is pine and light grapefruit.  Medium mouthfeel  I had this beer on tap in Iowa last year, and it was the best beer of the trip.

The nose is full of grapefruit notes and some spicy citrus aromas, but there’s an earthy note that’s intriguing.  The grapefruit is right in your face on the taste, but that earthy flavor adds a different texture to this, and there’s also some lemon lime notes that are really fantastic. Most excellent job by Trillium, IMHO.",0.6875037552310155,4.5,0.9475
Sip Of Sunshine,Been trying to get a hold of this for awhile. Had on tap in a tulip. Pours a dark Orange/gold with a little haze. Aroma is citrusy with some good floral.

Enjoy By IPA,"""Enjoy by 4/20/2016"" bomber.   Beautiful looking crisp beer. Smelled like mango and tropical fruits. Flavor was a bit bitter at first, but as it warmed up the bouquet of flavors really came through. Nice hop flavor with tropical notes and mango. Very light feel - bit too light for an DIPA IMO, but not distractingly so. Overall enjoyed this one, but probably wouldn't pick it up again.",0.689908369170246,3.75,0.9474
Vicinity,"16 oz can into pint glass, dated 1/25/17  Pours a pale straw color, almost opaque. Solid one-finger head with nice lacing, settles down fast. I love this look. Unfiltered opaqueness draws me in.  Aroma is moderately fragrant with lemon, grapefruit and dank grass. It is missing the tropical fruit smell that so many of their other IPAs have (don't worry - they come in with the taste).  Mouth feel has a zing of carbonation which I happen to like, a bit creamy smooth. It is lacking a malty depth  Taste is very pleasantly hop-forward, continuing the aroma but adding strong hints of orange and other tropical fruit. I call that a win. Malt is missing for the most part though a caramel malt laces into the background  Overall this is a strange DIPA if you are looking for depth of malt - though this should be expected if you are having the average Trillium offering. I think this is behind the various downgrades. The fact they didn't change the playbook for the double come as no surprise. Otherwise it is a stunningly delicious juice bomb, slightly more carbonated than the IPAs they make (which is refreshingly good). For me this is a ""wow"" beer and fits all my desires for the NE IPA. I seriously wish I had bought more of it on the last beer run.",0.6879512529881964,4.75,0.9474

Oude Geuze Vintage,"2007 St. Valentin Vintage. Poured from a corked and caged bottle into a Cantillon tulip. Shared with schen9303. Reviewed from notes.   A: Standard pour yields a 2 finger fluffy, foamy white head with awesome retention. Beer is a deep, clear apricot. Lacing is patchy and spotty with great cling. Te only thing keeping this from a ""5"" is the overall sparse lace.   S: Nose is prominent Brett, wet hay and rotting wood. Sweet apricot and a sharp lemon tartness round out the experience. Aromatic with moderate funk. Nice.   T: Opens lemon, overripe peaches, Brett, a sharp tartness and band-aid and cobwebs. Persistant sour from beginning to end. Wet wood and straw. End is tart lemon rind. Finish is strong crisp sourness with a Brett and tart aftertaste. Pretty one dimensional but that one dimension is done very well.   M: Light to medium bodied, with moderate carbonation. Dry and puckering in the mouth. Dry and tart going down. Finish is sharp with a filmy aftertaste. This one is really bone dry. Very quenching.   O: As is, the Vintage Oude Gueuze is a very solid representation of the style. However, its brother Armand Oude Gueuze 4 Lente just makes it pale in comparison and the availability is about the same. A solid beer overall but in the end, outclassed by beers made and blended by the same brewer.",0.6699812453472747,4.0,0.9471
Nectarine Premiere,"Had this on draft on site at De Garde. L: Orange, like a hazy NE style IPA, maybe even a bit more orange. Head was about a finger width and stayed around for a while.

I don't know if I could enjoy a beer more.",0.5718793186198672,5.0,0.9471
Madagascar,"Black liquid with mocha head that fizzles away quickly. Nothing out of the ordinary.  The aroma has milk chocolate, bourbon, and liquor. There is some faint vanilla notes after swirling the glass.  The taste starts with big vanilla notes nicely combined with a little bourbon. The finish has lots of milk chocolate and a little charred barrel.  The feel is a solid medium with some slickness.  Overall this is a very enjoyable BA vanilla stout. None of the flavors are cloying, but the vanilla is definitely pronounced. Luckily the backing flavors of chocolate and bourbon are able to come through on the finish. The question of aging always comes up and I feel like I must strongly recommend against. Drink this now, because there is no alcohol to mellow and no flavors to subdue.",0.6429932678852421,4.5,0.9468

Swish,"Thanks Blue_Rogue. This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a glazed over yellow/slight orange color. The head dissipated immediately. Light lacing stuck only around the glass. The smell had a wonderful sweet to lightly spiced combination of raw piney and grapefruit. Adequately enthralled with the substance of the bitter sweet citrus hops, a light burst of sweet onion runs into the aroma and blends wonderfully. The taste took all of those previously mentioned flavors and amplifies to flavor. There’s no aftertaste nor finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation hits like a good DIPA should but still isn’t overbearing. A lingering semi - soft bitter dryness rolls over my tongue. Overall, I say this was a very good DIPA that I would love to have again.",0.7115127020081996,4.0,0.9468

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"It being in the low 90's at the PONDerosa, today and just back from a stint at the pool, The PubScout decided to take a break from his usual IPA summer slakers and go back in time--like 1200+ years. Weihanstephaner Staatsbrauerei had hops growing near its monastery in 768 AD. And seeing a lonely bottle of this classic wheat beer in the back of my fridge, I decided to try to resurrect the reactions I had when first I tasted this incredible beer decades--not centuries--ago, no matter what Paul Z. says. I was first impressed back then by the banana-clove-bubblegum notes so very evident in the nose and on the palate. A crisp spiciness could also be detected with a bit of concentration, as well.  Great news! This is still the same wonderful wheat (at least 50%) beer that rocked my beer world back when hazy, juicy IPA's were not even on the radar.  And, with the temps soaring today, it was the perfect beer--smooth, medium mouthfeel, no bitter hop dominance and just a most refreshing, extraordinarily drinkable beer. Its low ABV (5.4%) makes it most sessionable, and I'd imagine it would pair well with anything except game meats and chocolate desserts. If those Juicy Haze-bombs ever run their course (and they likely will), millennials and everyone else might benefit by going ""Back to the Future,"" and discovering what a classic, refreshing summer beer is supposed to taste like. Everything old may well be new again.",0.6520219984914964,4.5,0.9468
Caffè Americano,"Pretty much exactly as advertised: a big coffee stout with complementary notes of chocolate and vanilla. Thick and viscous in the glass, has that coffee ice cream aroma shared by manny of the best new-age coffee stouts. Flavors pack a big punch of espresso and fudge. The thick, velvety, luxurious mouthfeel is definitely the high point for me.

Coolship Red,"We did a back to back of 2015 and 2016 CSR so this is a review of both. The 2015 was a little darker, both had this watermelon like look, with the brighter 2016 more along those lines. Both in color and that sort of faintness near the top of the glass. Musty aroma. Not too acidic. Balanced and approachable with good raspberry character. Some wash rind cheese that I've noticed in Allagash's Coolship beers. The 2016 had a little soapiness and was grainy on the finish, which I wonder if it will improve with time. I liked the 2015 better overall.",0.6817296636644615,4.25,0.9468
Oude Geuze Vintage,"2002 Vintage with the red label and handwritten bottling date. Thanks to myself for adding to my debt for this one.  Poured into a 5 oz. taster glass. Not a proper vessel for reviewing appearance, so my rating for this category is adjusted to create an accurate overall score.  Pours a murky glowing orange color. The aroma is a very balanced blend of sunflower seeds, musty attic, orange peel, and lemon zest.  The flavor is just insanely balanced and easy to drink. Sour up front with lemons, hay, and a strong tannin profile.  The body is medium and is as dry as Mars. And not the spots that might contain water.  Overall this vintage blend is definitely among the top 4 or 5 bottles of 3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze I have drank, which means it is one of the best beers on earth, period.",0.690175333996536,4.0,0.9468
Sip Of Sunshine,I tried this at Mews Tavern in Rhode Island. It poured a slightly hazy orangish with white head that left a spotty lace. The scent had great hop hints that included citrus peel and pine. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with some citrus and pine presence. The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall its a fantastic beer.,0.7007280983354259,4.5,0.9468
Enjoy By IPA,"Enjoy By 12/25/15, warmed for five to ten minutes Look: the beer pours a light orange color, white head with a good amount of carbonation. Some alcohol lacing on the glass Smell: I get some tropical fruit, I think pineapple, and then a little malt. Maybe some dankness. Pretty nice Taste: similar to the nose, pineapple for a short second, a little malt, and then a grapefruit bitterness Feel: dry, and bitter through most of the drink. Medium mouthfeel. Overall: a nice offering, but I've had better for sure. Maybe a few weeks earlier this would've been a lot better, but it reminds me of this years Abrasive from Surly",0.6683803294908762,4.0,0.9468
Sang Noir,"Dark garnet with a creamy, persistent tan-mauve blanket that lifts at the collar, leaving a bumpy ring of lace on the glass.  The nose, wow. Amazing, rich caramel. Deep, dark cherry. The peppery oak of bourbon brings vanilla and an almost fudgy, marshmallow aroma.  Taste is perfectly tart cherry with charred oak, spicy bourbon and a minimal sour sting paired with some heat and a rounding, smooth, creamy carbonation with a semi-dry, tingly finish.",0.6584231248830533,4.25,0.9468
Swish,"Best beer I've had in al long time. citrus tropical smell and taste seemed to overwhelm the palate. In a good way. This DIPA is not overrated . One of the best I've ever had. Also, Love the grapefruit juice straw color and a solid mouth feel.",0.6555844502065675,5.0,0.9468
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"First 3 of the 4 pack were fresh and this last one is just short of a year in the cellar. Pours about as dark as it gets and just as you think there will be no head at all, a centimeter of thick foam slowly appears out of the abyss. Nose is vanilla, brown bread, leather, and what to me smells like brown sugar pop tarts. Taste is...damn that's fucking good. Pretty much what you'd expect from the nose but the thickness of this beer is pretty amazing considering the ABV and barrel aging. Some tobacco, and some residual sweetness really round this out. Overall, damn.",0.6113143733862052,4.5,0.9467
Haze,"This one is damn near crazy. I mean, wow! One time my baby mama dressed up in Lonely Lingerie for my 33rd birthday, and just like that surprise, Tree House Haze came to the party like the hot chick on Eric Clapton’s side. This damn thing is so pure and lush, it just may have been baptized. Beautiful and perfect hazy essence, is then bombarded by A massive, I mean MASSIVE apricot backbone it’s damn near insane like Edgar Allen Poe on acid. This is the most perfect Hazy I have ever had.

Sure Bet,"Pours an effervescent honey color with a thumb+of eggshell colored head. Great lacing & head retention  S: Citrus, pine, breadyness. Mango shines through as it warms  T: Huge breadyness & mango presence along with dryness from the honey up front, faint orange notes as well. Dryness, mango, a little pine mingle as this warms, plus a little more orange. Finishes citrussy, a little dry with a little apricot & plenty of mango  MF: Fairly chewy, subtle carbonation, nice balance, becomes warming down the home stretch  Mango is the star, drinks great",0.6666511678569872,4.25,0.9466
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Bottled 23 January 2012 Glowing ruby red, wispy pink foam, jewel tone but light haze. Cobweb skim, spotty lace.  Funky barrel aroma, wet oak, seedy fresh raspberries.  Blistering sourness, super puckering. Juicy raspberries make your mouth water before going completely bone dry. Nice and oaky, explodes with fruit. A fuller feel, with a slight spritz of carbonation, balanced acidity and a light hit of sharpness. Stable funk with soiled hay and washed rind farmhouse cheese. Just the right amount of nuance and equal parts sour fruit delivery system.",0.681096192536532,4.5,0.9464
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"L: Cloudy amber color with a big fluffy white head.  S: Spicy and has that distinctive German yeast strain smell (at least I think it's the yeast).  T: Of course has the banana and clove notes, but not as much as I expected. Some lemon as well. Some grain qualities, but not really sweet like malt can sometimes be. Very clean, somewhat dry finish.  F: Fairly light body and carbonation. Very smooth and almost too easy to drink.  O: I think the best word to describe this beer is balance. All the flavors work well together and nothing dominates. So easy to drink I wish I had bought a six pack of this instead of a single. I may have to go back to get more.",0.6854755787800579,4.25,0.9464
Chocolate Rain,"2014 Vintage. Still super boozy as to be expected but the malt bill tackles the ethanol with flair. Plenty of bourbon and chocolate fountain on the nose. Sweet vanilla bourbon, turbinado sugar, molasses, and dark chocolate (the good kind) in the taste. The mouthfeel is about as viscous as you can imagine and breathes out ethanol. Delicious and in need of many more years in the bottle.",0.6279657318663255,4.75,0.9464
Society & Solitude #4,"Shared by Wowcoolman at Woodshop 7  Look: Pours a yellowish orange color with a 1/2 inch white head good retention and some nice circular lace  Smell: Tropical fruit galore here pineapple mango come to mind due to the Citra hops.   Taste: Again there is some tropical fruits mangos, peach and pineapple are all present. But I must say that I was not a fan of the way the Citra and Galaxy hops blended together it created a weird flavor that I can't really explain  Mouthfeel: Medium body and good amount of carbonation and slightly dry  Overall: I wanted to really like this beer because I absolutely love citra hops but in the end it just ended up being a solid DIPA and nothing overly special",0.6790660129835232,4.0,0.9464
Mastermind,"Enjoyed poured into a modified tulip. A wonderful bright nose, lots of citrus and lily. The taste is much the same. A slight slickness covers the palate, a dryer finish might help with the close out here. The carbonation is steady but cannot compete with the body. Overall a nice IIPA that with some slight refinement could be incredible. Fine work by Fiddlehead.  Cheers all",0.6891606020799234,4.5,0.9464
Black Tuesday,"2014 bottle. Pours dark brown with little to no head. This isn't black. Smells like bourbon and vanilla. The flavor is intense and cloying. Bourbon dominates the profile, and the flavor is super rich...there is some vanilla coming through, but that is about it. I am not picking up any oaky notes. I don't taste any malt or hops. All sticky sweet bourbon goodness. The body is medium, and much lighter than i anticipated. The mouthfeel is bit fizzy, and lacks the creamy texture that i want in a big stout. Carbonation is very low. Overall, i am glad i tried this but i think this beer is more for those who prefer the thrill of the chase, and the novelty of this beer.",0.6631501484624863,2.75,0.9464
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Had the honor of trying this at DLD 08, thanks Nick! :)  Insane, Black Death (mixed with a shovel full of Black Plague) and a little charred motor oil (after being removed from a car that hasn't had an oil change in 10,000 miles).   Brown, slimy, super-sticky legs (maybe tentacles) that don't fade, ever. Fine bourbon all over the nose, all in one glass cup. This beer sticks to the glass (and may actually be melting it).  In a word, ""Ferocious"".  I am not a fan of most bourbon barrel-aged beers. Most are too sweet for my palate. This beer represented the bourbon-style of beers the way I like 'em. It kept true to form, in that it wasn't overpoweringly sweet, but fiercely ""bourbonie"" or carried a very strong alcohol in the nose and mouth.   This drink is truly a meal in itself. Not for the tame drinker - this beer kicked my ass and it will kick your ass, as well.  If FFF's ever bottled this, I recommend Flame grilling a super-thick porterhouse to crack open one of these with friends. Don't drink it alone!",0.573005098563589,4.0,0.9463
Mastermind,"Can. Pours an opaque orange/yellow color. Big, fluffy, lasting head. Loads of snaked lacing. True to Vermont DIPA form, this brew is excessively hopped with new varietals. Hops on the nose have nuances of green onion and bubblegum. Grass and citrus and lots of tropical fruit notes. Very exciting nose. Flavor starts off green and herby. Grass, onion, weed, moss. Then comes the parade of tropical fruits that are specifically peachy and apricotty. It finishes with a serious bubblegum, clementine and tangerine flavor medley. I love the hops used here...what are they??? Medium body and softer carbonation. Bitterness is lasting and sneakily powerful. Light hint of alcohol. This is up there with some of the best Vermont DIPAs I have had. I actually prefer this to their newly acclaimed 2nd Fiddle. Boy, here comes another VT brewery!",0.6640872185990234,4.5,0.9462
Chocolate Rain,"2015 vintage. 6oz pour in a Bruery snifter at The Bruery.   L: Pours with a light swirly mocha head. Oily blackness.  S: Intense aroma of milk and dark chocolate, dark fruit, figs, vanilla, oak, freshly baked cookies and smores. An exciting beer to whiff over and over.   T: Wow. Vanilla, brownies, chocolate and cookie dough hit at the front of the tongue, with oak and an almost white chocolate character at the back. There's some slight bitter stout roastiness and bourbon flavor in the mix, but it's barely detectable and it works well to balance out and dial down the sweetness.   F: 18.4% ABV... I don't understand how Bruery does it. Vanilla, brownie fudge and oak coat the tongue, and while you can feel a good amount of heat as it goes down... it's by no means harsh and finishes really clean for how big of a beer it is.   Overall: A well-rounded, stunningly delicious and decadent world-class barrel aged imperial stout.",0.6487059018725383,4.25,0.9462
Mastermind,Got a bunch of cans from the last release and heard so much hype about it. I honestly don't think it is that great or even worth going out of your way for.

Aroma is a bit more malt forward than the GFP, with sweet notes of honey and melon, mango, pineapples, tropical citrus. Flavor is sweet papaya and melon, some pineapple in the background, low bitter and higher on the sweetness. Medium bodied, medium low carbonation, dank and more syrupy than the others (not in a bad way). Some interesting malty bready flavors lingering on the finish. A good bit of lower level from others from Trillium that I've had thus far. Almost like sweet melon juice and the hops are surprisingly mellow here given the supposed large dry hop.

Coolship Red,"Drank from a 12.7 fl oz (375 ml) corked and caged bottle Date Bottled: Dec. 21, 2015 Served in a tulip Huge thanks to my friend Bill for sharing this with me.  The hazy, light magenta body was capped by a finger tall, bubbly, bright white crown that slowly faded to a lasting ringlet. No lacing whatsoever.  Berry notes came through big time in the nose. Not sure if this was a cherry or a raspberry beer initially. Somewhat tart yet also sweet. Slightly medicinal perhaps. Soon, the fresh raspberry notes took over. Really pure, bright and fragrant. There was a slightly powdery and dry yeastiness. Bit of lemony tartness as well. Spectacular.  Raspberry notes dominated in the flavor profile. Tart and fresh. Sour but not overly so. Slightly funky. Wheaty and lemony in the center. Touch of lemon rind on the back end. More raspberry too. Raspberry seeds perhaps. The finish was sour and dry without being too intense. Hint of oak.  Frothy, fluffy mouthfeel. The liquid was highly carbonated and contained an intense, large bubbled effervescence. Crisp and sprightly on the palate.  There is usually a distinct difference between authentic, naturally fermented Belgian fruit lambics and their American counterparts, but Allagash's Coolship Red tasted like the real deal. This brewery might be the only one in the country that has mastered the art (and science) of using a coolship to achieve such nuance and complexity in their beers.",0.7077057774358314,4.5,0.9458

Aaron,Words can't describe how good this beer truly is. It's just the best beer I've ever had so far.  Like ... how? This was the first thought that passed through my mind. It's so complex. I just ... enjoyed it. The retention on the tan head. The left over swirl effect. The smell is the only thing that could possibly be bad as it is fairly weak but I think it was done on purpose that way. The taste was so complex I literally cannot describe it. The feel is equal to some of the best stouts I've had as it was just super creamy.   Overall. Just get this beer. It's that good. Makes me appreciate life as I drink it.

Swish,"OK, this stuff is amazing. Pours a shade of gold that immediately lets you know you're in for a treat. Smell is actually fairly mild compared to how rich in flavor it is, with notes of general dankness, and some sweet fruitiness that becomes more apparent as it warms up. Mouthfeel is incredible, it's somehow smooth AND substantial. The flavor lands on your tongue with a bang, then leaves slowly, and gradually, as if it was melting, but wanted to take its time.

Pours a cloudy, very dark golden range color golden tangerine/burnt orange hues when held to a light and a one finger frothy white head that slowly fades into a lasting ring. Sporadic spots of lacing left behind.  Funky, earthy aroma with a heavy barnyard/horsey presence that is countered by crisp light fruit and sweet vinegar. Subtle lactic presence. A bunch of earthy oak along with the funky bugs as well as some grassy straw, cobwebs and musty funk. Hints of apple, pear, grape and tangerine. Extremely complex nose that has my mouth watering. I literally smelled this beer for ten minutes before taking the first sip.   Medium bodied yet fuller than expected with an intensely sour, mouth-puckering flavor that lingers throughout into a sweet, slightly acidic, vinegary tart finish. Very dry and tart up front with only slight acidity in the finish. No solvent or harsh acetic character at all. Extremely funky with lots of earthy oak tannins, bugs and a touch of vinaigrette which is balanced by a slight lactic presence as well as some light fruit. Hints of apple, pear and lemon combined with the vinegar character give this beer a sweet and tart lingering finish that leaves me drooling for another sip. After the initial palate shock this beer proves to be incredibly complex, well balanced and flavorful.   Overall, I had very high expectations for this beer and they were exceeded.

Darkstar November,"500 ml waxed bottle with a really cool label. Bottled around Nov. 2014  It pours deep ruby and black. Perfectly modest amount of carbonation.   It smells like rich sugar and single barrel bourbon. It tastes like a chocolate vanilla bourbon pie. It's definitely a little hot though. It could benefit from some age to take the edge of the 13.7% and add some toasted marshmallow to that chocolate flavor.

Enjoy By IPA,"Look: Golden, with a large head that slowly dissipates. Good lacing as well.  Smell: A strong grapefruit aroma is noticeable the second the cap is removed. After the pour I get strong grapefruit and lemon aromas, with just a little bready malt. I also get a distinct smell of grapefruit slices (the gummy candy). Just a little bit of bitterness comes through as well.  Taste: A mild piney bitterness hits up front for just a brief moment before giving out to a balance of bready malt and citrus flavors. Grapefruit shines through the most, along with lemon, tangerine, and some elderflower-like floral notes. Finishes with a mingling of tropical fruit, pepper, and just a vague lingering bitterness.  Feel: Medium bodied, and low-to-medium carbonation. very smooth.  I never quite understood what people meant when they called beer “juicy”, but I think this is what they're talking about.

Tangerines, grapefruit, nectarines.. this could be an IPA were it not for the acidity.  And there is plenty of that. It's dry and sour, with carbonation that is borderline effervescent.

Aaron,"Bottle. I have been waiting for this bitch for ages. I tried both the 2016 & 2018 batches. This was one of my biggest wants because I figured Hill Farmstead does everything else great, I bet they would nail a Barleywine as well. Oh, and it is barrel aged for like an eon. Aaron pours a dark brown. Not necessarily clear bodied behind the tint of the beer. A thin, defeated ring of diminutive bubbles rest steadily around the outer conversion of beer and glass; the only thing minute about this beer. The aroma rises out of the glass like a slothful perfume. Thick, damp whiffs of bourbon, raisins, toffee, and dessert wine. Detailed, rich, royal. The flavor marches in line with the nose. Heavy, sweet, and decadent. I think the older batch has a bit more complexity but lacks the barrel character of it's newer kin. I get some flavors of boozy dates and maple syrup from both, though. Of course the feel stands abreast with the other elements of the beer. Portly, heavy, and warming. Toothsome but intense. Definitely lived up to the hype I personally gave this beer. The best Barleywine I have ever had.",0.6324603569774088,4.75,0.9452
Sure Bet,"What is there to say that hasn't already been said about Sure Bet. This beer is one of Pipework's best offerings, and the latest batch is once again on the mark. A big, dank hop aroma pours out of the glass, and the taste of mango and honey are very well balanced against the bitterness of the hops. Feels great to the palette, well balanced carbonation and not too sticky. As others have said, very similar to the Fish Series of DIPAs from Pipeworks, and I wouldn't be surprised if the (formerly) puking unicorn grows fins in the future. An excellent offering that is well worth its rating.",0.6634375113881428,4.5,0.9452
Scaled Up,"Poured from a growler into a tulip. Great smell, pineapple, pine, a little banana? whipped cream head with fairly small bubbles that fall away. Orange and hazy. Good bubbly mouthfeel, not a ton of body. Tastes of pine, a little maltier than many American doubles, some apricot, a little smoky and some peppery heat to end things. Almost has a whisky finish. Great, great stuff.",0.6404899949559285,4.5,0.9451

Enjoy By IPA,"This beer is just a great clean and balanced double IPA. Its just the right level of bitter and sweet. The taste is clean and refreshing, with hints of citrusy mango, pineappley tasting goodness. After taking part in the NEIPA craze lately, I always forgot how great the classic tastes are.",0.693806354250002,4.75,0.9451
Vicinity,"The citrusy, tropical, floral notes in this one makes for one of the best mouth feels in a DIPA that ive had. The balance between the sweetness from the malt bill and the hops combo is great. Galaxy, Citra and Colombus hops makes this extra juicy with a perfect thick haze.",0.6757064171971594,4.5,0.9451
Haze,Nice lemon color with a 2 finger head that slowly fades. Smell is of tropical fruits and grapefruit. A beautiful balance of flavors that linger on the palate well after. I am very impressed with this outstanding brew.,0.7034581311187221,4.5,0.945
Green,"Green is delicious, different hop flavor than I am used to. Very Potent, but definitely great, I prefer Julius a bit more, but would go for this beer any time. Each time I have it I like it more and more.",0.6385980276030075,4.25,0.945
Haze,"Pretty tasty - but is it substantially better than any of the other NE IPAs out there? I don't think so, but the can I came across was nearly four months old, so who knows.  L: Like a light orange juice. Thin head and opaque, light orange coloring. S: Good smell, but nothing necessarily that the can claimed. I only really picked up light hop flavors. T: Again, a good beer, but I don't see how it sets itself apart from much of the pack, at least these days. F: Hop oil is all over this one and there isn't any of the thinness you see in some of the more recent NE IPAs. Strangely, I'm a fan of the feel of this beer more than anything else. O: I take nothing away from Tree House, as pioneers of this style. But I think the competition has caught up. Haze is a good, tasty beer. But I don't think I need to seek out this style from New England.",0.5930686518371866,3.75,0.945
Vicinity,"Canned on Aug/09. Drank on Oct/12. Poured to a BrewDog stemmed glass.  A: Body is a vibrant mix of yellow and orange that's totally opaque. Head is minimal, existing only when pouring. S: There's tons of hoppy grassy tones with a citric base that's even hard to explain due to the intensity of the hop aroma. It's too prominent actually. T: Taste starts off so sweet, having hints of vanilla, orange, tangerine, mango, peach, even a bit of milk can be felt here. After this genius mix of flavours the beer ends with a perfect grassy hoppy tone that's very solid. M: Body is medium to high. Carbonation is perfect. Alcohol is unnoticed. Bitterness is high. Generally speaking, this mouthfeel is genius. O: This is some of the best Trillium beers I've had so far.",0.700590049395063,4.5,0.945
Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Sante Adairius snifter glass. Acquired in a trade.   Pours a sunshine-golden, hazy body with a big fluffy white three finger head that reduces slowly to leave nice lacing and good retention.   Aromas are funky, yeasty, barnyard and heavy acidic citrus, oak and champagne sitting on a light malty backbone. This smells heavenly!  On the tongue is light lactic / citrus tartness upfront, followed by oak and wheaty barnyard, green apple and white wine. Finishes dry and lightly bitter. Stunningly drinkable, a great quencher for a warm day. Medium carbonation and medium light body.   A very well done Saison - extreme balance and flavor.",0.6893960508307041,4.5,0.945
Black Tuesday, down to San Diego for a brewery tour. Came down to time it to have Black Tuesday and didn't realize you had to be a special member to get a taste... Pled my case and luckily one of the bartenders had sympathy and snuck me a glasss! Gave him a hefty tip and enjoyed an amazing beer!,0.4537454671579298,4.5,0.9449
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Poured into a tall pint glass.  Very hazy bright golden color, high carbonation. Good retention and lacing from its big soapy, fluffy white head.  Smells incredibly citrusy, with the smell of orange, bubble gum, banana, and cloves masking my nose. Of course wheaty, yeasty, and grainy, along with biscuit and bread malts.  Taste is much like the aroma. There's also a lot of different other spices as well, like coriander and other floral hops.  Outstanding.",0.6580767794341205,4.75,0.9449
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),On tap at DLD 2012 (and 2011).  Pitch black and syrupy as all dark lords tend to be. Oak comes through more in this version than it does in the vanilla. And the sweetness and heat from the bourbon seems subdued and dried by that oak.   The dark fruit flavors come through more in this version rather than vanilla also. I don't know if this is aged longer than vanilla bean but the beer seems much less sweet and much richer in flavor.   But it's also not quite as big or rich as vanilla. I would call those two a tie or maybe vanilla has a very slight edge.,0.6413509190067372,4.5,0.9447
Haze,"Canned 4/20/2016. Can saying: ""Alright x 3"". I can dig the Matthew McConaughey reference.  Appearance - Living up to its name, Haze is... hazy. This is pretty much the de facto description of the appearance for all Tree House IPAs so far. It seems to be a little lighter in appearance than either Julius or Sap. The head is very foamy and long-lasting.  Aroma - The nose brimming with juicy notes from the fresh hops and the peach aroma is through the roof. A pulpy orange note follows next like a glass of freshly-squeezed O.J. and just the faintest hint of pine at the end.  Taste - Finally, a Tree House beer that tastes as good as it smells. The hops are obviously the most dominant flavor here, but it is all juicy goodness; there is almost no bitterness at all despite the high alcohol and hop dosage. Again, I'm getting tons of peach, orange, pine sap, and other tropical fruits that it's pretty crazy actually. Perhaps a tiny bit of malt backbone as well, but who needs it when the hops carry the flavor as well as this does?  Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with good carbonation. Tree House nails the body perfectly once again, with a soft texture that accentuates the hops. This is probably the lightest DIPA I've had.  Closing Arguments - Overall, this is far-and-away the best Tree House beer I've had so far that I could actually sit down with and analyze. Lights On may give it a run for its money, but that was at a tasting, so different circumstances there. Whereas Julius and Sap didn't live up to their billing, Haze carries the standard and doesn't relinquish it in the flavor. If I had this blind, there's no way I'd peg it as anywhere close to 8%. Dangerously crushable for sure.",0.6745734007122272,4.75,0.9447
Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,"4 pack Whole Foods in Cleveland. Pours a clear orange/light copper colour with limited off white head. Aroma dank piney, citrus, slightly floral, creeping into sweaty, but deliciously so. Taste starts sweet for a millisecond before the pine bitterness slaps you with a sticky resinous blast on the back of just a touch of caramel malt. Finishes slightly sticky with palate coating bitterness that warns against consuming anything else for a while, yet not a punishing bitter, a wondrously tasty one! Absolutely great.",0.6850618233758791,4.5,0.9447
Peche 'n Brett,"Brewed on May 2012, “Best by: 01/2018”, opened in Jan 2015.  Appearance – Pours a cloudy peachy orange color with a beautiful head and very nice lacing.  Smell – A slightly sour smell with oak, brett, and vinegar. I actually didn’t notice the peach.  Taste – Brett, white wine, oak, and just a slight hint of peach.  Mouthfeel – Tart and dry with a nice medium carbonation. A little sour aftertaste.  Drinkability – This is a pretty good sour – a style that I’m generally not a huge fan of. Goes down easy for 10%abv.",0.6571767020995208,4.25,0.9447
Space Trace,"Nice looking stout. Smell is of bourbon, sweetness, and coconut. Taste follows the nose, nice rich flavor with bourbon and coconut dominating the palate. Some roastiness. Coats the tounge nice but slightly thin and is a little over carbed. Overall good coconut stout. The coconut could be stronger",0.6662245441277069,4.25,0.9446
Thicket,"375 mL bottle poured into a snifter.  Appearance - Deep purple. Lightly pink head. Very pretty beer.  Smell - Strong berry. Wine barrel, too. Strong vinous notes.  Taste - Intense blackberry flavor. Equally strong is the red wine flavor with it. Quite sour, but not as sour as other Side Project sours, which I like.  Mouthfeel - Medium body. Medium carbonation. Hefty sourness.  Overall - Excellent fruit flavor, but the wine flavor is in equal proportion. Just about a tolerable amount of sourness.",0.6864967005812588,4.0,0.9446
Oude Geuze Vintage,"2006 vintage 750ml bottle shared with eagles22. This had a synthetic cork that took a bit of effort to remove and didnt have any hiss or pop behind it. Poured into a cervoise, this brew appears a caramel looking orange. Pretty much still looking except for a few large bubbles that were created during the pour. There is orange clarity and light yellow coloration around the sides when held to the light.  The smell is strikingly sweet with vanilla barrel aged inclusion and caramel malt. A little cheese and funk across the back that grows as it warms with some lemony lactic notes. Very sweet overall with barrel aged properties being right in the open instead of subtle like previous samples.  The taste is sharp and tangy with cheese, funk, sour lemony lactic notes a bit rindy with a hugely salivating factor to it. Sweet caramel backing is lightly toasted with a touch of smoke. Huge barrel aged presence with vanilla and funk intermingled. I cannot get over how much residual sugar and caramel malt/vanilla inclusion there is in this gueze.  This is a medium bodied brew. Not still but boasts a very light level of carbonation. This experience certainly differs from my previous samples. I cant say it was bad but certainly interesting. I think it might be time to finally bust out some of the older bottles I have been hanging on to.",0.6887105813200224,4.5,0.9446
Sip Of Sunshine,"Canned 11/29. Drank out of a TEKU.  Look: light to medium gold color with a medium to medium minus haze and a finger of bright white head.  Aroma: Definitely citrus forward. Mostly grapefruit. Some mango in there as well. Aroma doesn't burst out of the glass though.   Flavor: Citrus translates to the palate along with a strong pithy, Campari like bitter finish.   Mouthfeel: Not thin by any means but thinner than it's ABV would imply. Makes the beer very drinkable.  Overall(style points): One of the original NE style IPAs that revolutionized the world of beer. It's still good enough to hang with many of the juice bombs coming out nowadays but its no longer among the best. 91 Points.",0.6893320763363593,4.5,0.9446
Black Tuesday,"Absolutely spectacular stout. Sweet, dense, creamy and one of the best stouts out there. Incredible balance between chocolate, coffee and vanilla. A definite sipper. Wish I could get some more. The only way to improve this would be to age it with cacao nibs and vanilla.",0.6886818336050403,4.25,0.9446
Beatification,"Imbibed from a bottle, as it was Batch 5 (no kegs of this one) at RRBC on 4/22/12.  Pours a clear gold, a little light. Not much head left after what looked like a typical amount of head from a Belgian yeast. Lots of citrus, peach, super sour. Hard to pick out the aromas in this one. Overall, flowery sweet with a heaping dose of tart. Speaking of which, the first thing you taste is a nearly overwhelming sourness, but it mellows fast. Lime is prevalent with a faint taste of sour cherry and strawberry. Winey aftertaste. White wine. Tartness comes after the wine, with very little hop aftertaste as well. Vinous hops. Very watery feel, but after sourness subsides, bitterness gives it some substance. Dry finish.  Beautiful. Complex. This has some flavors I've never had in a sour beer (cherry, strawberry) that I've enjoyed. I want to try it again and again to pick out the other flavors hidden inside.",0.6675742350380076,4.5,0.9446
Peche 'n Brett,"Pours a medium gold with a copious amount of fluffy head. Good retention and carbonation throughout. Aroma is pretty much straight dried peach with little piques from oak tannin and champagne yeast.   Taste is much the same. The peach is present but doesn't dominate, and the Brett plays a quiet supporting role (maybe too quiet) adding some straw, loan and earthy nut. The oak lends a bit of a hot ending, and I'm not sure I loved the sweeter peach notes marriage to the heavy rustic notes. That said, it is a very strong beer with unique flavor combinations and is definitely worth a try",0.6908080108585817,4.25,0.9445
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Bottle Date: 3/9/16 Palate Contaminants: none  Back to the fridge for another bottle of Trillium.  Appearance is an opaque and straw colored.  Smell is one of the sweetest I can recall. There's a little grassiness, but it's dominated by pineapple, with a little mango.  The taste has the pineapple, but not as sweet. Some banana and honeydew melon, and there's some lactic taste, too. There's also some citrus that I can best describe as sour nectarine, but it's in the background. Nothing is out of balance, it all goes together nicely.  Feel is slightly carbonated, and it's nice and smooth.  I'm glad I have one more bottle.",0.6749935840433534,4.5,0.9445
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),Well let's start with what isn't there to love about this beer. I was skeptical about it as I think the regular Dark Lord is way to cloying and needs a couple years to mellow in the bottle. But the BBA DL I enjoyed was a 2015 bottle at Kane on 8/14/15 and boy was it amazing. Was still a little sweet but killed it in every aspect. A lot of great dark fruit flavors melded extremely well with the bourbon barrel aging!,0.5968232718764233,4.75,0.9442
Nelson,It's a light gold color. The appearance is not representative of the overall huge flavor it has. The smell is fresh like orange juice and very piney. The taste is super refreshing and light and very flavorful and the ending notes are exceptionally loaded with fresh hops. It's very high on the drinkability scale. IT's an amazing beer in the IPA category.,0.7128192704138199,4.5,0.9442
Second Fiddle,"The aroma explodes of juicy mangoes, peaches, oranges. Just sweet nectar and fruity.  The flavor follows with sweet orange and grapefruit throughout. Almost towards fruit syrup. A medium sweetness in the middle, with some resinous and grapefruit on the finish. More herbal, pine, resin, tea, on the finish.   A beer that is dangerously drinkable and addictive, despite its reasonable amount of malt. Impressively clean. Very much a West Coast style, though one of the best in that style.",0.6846970740526954,4.25,0.9442
Chocolate Rain,"Absolutely incredible. Like molten chocolate pebbles cereal, only with more luscious and rich chocolate to go with the fantastic bourbon, vanilla, flavors. Maybe a bit dried fruit too. The smell is hypnotic, drawing you in for more. The Bruery uses larger bottles, but it still felt like not enough! The high booziness sneaks up on you, a masterpiece!",0.6567718768376353,4.75,0.9442
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"This is a glorious example of why Hill Farmstead is probably the best brewery in the world.

Aaron,"I've not had a ton of HF beers, but everyone I've had is delicious and this was no exception. An aroma of bourbon and stone fruits and the taste was smooth bourbon, stone fruit and brown sugar. Probably one of the best English style BW I've had the pleasure of having.",0.6208351948720505,4.75,0.9442
Beatification,"Appearance - The poured the color of apple juice with visible carbonation, but little head.   Smell - The nose was very tart, and had fruity notes that I could not attach to a fruit.   Taste - The initial impression was sour apples. Later notes of guava andvpeppery spice were identifiable. As the taste progresses, it seemed to become more acidic.   Mouthfeel - The body seemed thicker than the average sour, which I found impressive.   Mouthfeel - I enjoyed this sour, but I think scarcity drives the score. Russian River makes better sours than this one.",0.6800333086826702,4.25,0.9442
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Poured out as a very nice red color with a decent clarity to it. The smell of the beer has a good amount of funk on the nose along with a lot of Raspberry. The taste is really tart, the mixture of the funk with the natural fruit in there just put that sour quality over the top. The feel has a medium body with a dry finish. Overall it's another great Lambic from Cantillon.",0.7010734942018949,4.75,0.9441
Beatification,"Pours a hazy golden color. Smells like a grapefruit tart. When I tasted this it reminded me when I was kid and I like to buy these atomic sour candies. When you bite into it it bites back with a scourge of sourness throughout. That is the best description for this brew and I like it! Really sour, tart, lemon, and just awesome.",0.6092431602234984,4.0,0.9441
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Pours a jet black with a tight light tan head. Nose is of spices. Cinnamon, a bit of heat and dark roasted malts. Taste is extremely mellow. I mean that in a good way. This is a extremely easy drinking and pleasant beer for being a BA Imperial Stout. Notes of roasted malt, black coffee, caramel, candied bourbon, cinnamon and vanilla. Finished of with a slightest touch of heat from the peppers and bourbon heat. A little nuttiness in there as well. Silky medium to full body with a bit of chewiness to it. Really enjoyed this one. It’s smooth!",0.6674526943550997,4.5,0.944
Sang Noir,"The pour barely kicks up enough dusting to cover the surface, quickly evaporates without leaving any lacing behind. The liquid is a brownish red hue which yellows at the rims, the bubbles are extremely fine and almost rise in sheets. Very balanced nose with a hint of oak toast and caramel, the cherry scents resonate for some time without it ever seeming like a one trick pony, lemony, mildly doughy, underlying kick from an earth to vinegar element, very nice in how it harmonizes diverse elements to the point you prefer to enjoy them as one than parse out. Medium-bodied, soft pétillance, sour right from the first sip and here there’s a more feral edge to it, yeast, animal fur and quinine. The cherries hit you most upfront then knit back in whereas it’s the opposite for the oak with a lot of cream and vanillin accents at the end, particularly after it’s warmed some. Mixes in white grape to white raisin as well as fig. Resonates for a long time after the swallow. Good to see a beer that can use oak but dial it back so it’s not clumsily overt. A glass or two is all you need and best consumed in quiet over a period of time. (2015 Project)",0.6888684749422344,4.0,0.9439
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Jet black with a very thin cap, but more than I commonly see in BA stouts. Bourbon is pronounced but not obnoxious. Tons of caramel and vanilla in the nose with heavy roasted malt and chocolate. The taste doesn't have the sickly soy sauce like sweetness that can bury these beers for me. Thick, viscous feel without leaving too much sweetness in the finish.",0.6082608314140052,4.75,0.9439
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"11/4/18 (Kalamazoo): $8 9 oz 13.4% ABV draft pour, into snifter bought at the brewery during All Stouts Day. Pitch black pour, thin off-white bubbly ring around top of pour. Nice smooth, not overpowering whiskey aroma, malt subdued. Very nice whiskey taste, slight burn, Malt and chocolate noted, nice blend, mellow, not overpowering, very nice pour. Light creamy texture, thin, smooth drinking. Overall very good pour.",0.6488357787370498,4.25,0.9439
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Pitch black in color, slight tan head that disappears quickly, but the carbonation remains. Nose is strong barrel and intrigue. Rich chocolate and roast flavor with vanilla. Coats the tongue.   Regular Expo is one of my favorite stouts, but not if it's fresh. BA Expedition is all of the intensity of Expo but mellowed by the barrel. Good stuff.",0.6686341105490491,4.75,0.9438
Sure Bet,"Pours bright yellow-orange with big pillowy head and lots of sediment. Smell is very tropical and sweet, light citrus, and mild melon notes. Taste is loaded with sweet citus, bold mango, and sweet tropical fruit. Body is light and dangerous at 9.5% abv. This is definitely a different DIPA that is light and sweeter than your average high gravity brew. Very tasty and worth a try.",0.6840384856943379,4.25,0.9438
Green,"Good lord the juiciness on this bad boy.   This was the third offering from Tree House I have been able to try and it's far and away my favorite so far.   L - Hazy cloudy light orange appearance as expected. S - Overwhelming pineapple, peach, mango jumps out first T - Same tropical fruits complemented with tons of orange apparent once it hits the palate F - Great thick solid mouthfeel O - One of my favorite 3-5 IPAs I've ever had the pleasure of tasting.   More Please!",0.6346861562898164,4.75,0.9438
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Bottled 10/16/2018. Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. It pours a very dark walnut - nearly black - with a half finger of creamy, light mocha-colored head and thin sheen of lacing. On the fragrant nose there is a heavy scent of bourbon along with roasted malt, dark chocolate, freshly-brewed coffee, toffee, hazelnut, and black cherry. This is absolutely delicious! It opens with rich chocolate and coffee followed by caramel/toffee, tobacco, char, and the always welcome notes of black cherry and plum. The bourbon is strong but not overpowering. It compliments the other flavors rather than distracting. The mouth feel is rich and creamy with low/moderate carbonation, and the 13.4% ABV is delightfully warming. While I'm a big fan of the standard version of Expedition, this is an entirely different drinking experience. It stands toe to toe with KBS.",0.6530262857615193,4.5,0.9437
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),Had this on tap at DLD 2011  A-poured a motor oil black with a tiny tan head and alittle bit of lacing  S- Has a strong bourbon smell up fron followed by some dark fruit notes as well as come chocolate and malts  T- Has a strong bitter chocolate flavor up front followed by a nice malty middle and then finishs with a pur bourbon kick.   M-Full bodied with nice carbonation  O-Overall this was a top notch beer. Not as good as Vanilla DLD by any means. Well atleast in my opinion. In my little circle of 8 guys at DLD this was all their fav. besides me. Very good beer but just alittle too much bite and hottness to love it. Will have it again at DLD for sure.,0.608760364310574,4.0,0.9437
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Bottled April 2010.  Pour is a dark purple-pink. 1-2 finger fluffy head.   Nose is some cherry sweetness, lemon rind, tart apple, mustiness, funk.  Taste is slight fruity sweetness, lightly puckering lactic tartness, lemon, hint of tart cherry, a little funk at the back end. Not very big on cherry flavor... I think they've probably faded a bit. Delicious, not as funky as some lambics but very refreshing.  Mouthfeel is medium-light, dry, appropriately fizzy carbonation.   Wonderfully drinkable. Refreshing, light, I could drink this forever. Probably my favorite kriek I've had so far, on par with the '05 LP kriek.",0.6447598301996904,4.5,0.9437
Madagascar,love this beer.. huge vanilla and bourbon smell as soon as you crack the bottle.. when its warm it is so smooth.. one of the BBA stouts I have ever had.. really really well done.. solid mouthfeel.. overall great beer,0.6238488772338444,4.75,0.9436
Haze,"Can dated 10/30: The beer pours with a significant haze to a pale yellow golden body. It's not totally opaque, and while I'm not likely to see through this beer except at the very end, there is a little bit of light bleeding through at the edges, sneaking through just inside the medium white ring. The lacing on this beer seems to form a bit of a futuristic alphabet on the glass wall.  The nose is surprisingly not jumping out at me, initially. There's a generic malty note to the nose at first, with perhaps a little papaya and melon. As it warmed, a little bit of a Orange Julius vibe came through before finally yielding some orange and grapefruit pith.  The feel reminds me of many a NE IPA, with about medium thickness and a certain creaminess to the drink. There is a little bit of a biting carbonation that breaks this up and lightens the overall impression.  The flavor has an heavily oat-influenced malt aspect to it. It's not actually that sweet, but even by the end of the taste, it never gets too bitter. The orange influence is definitely more obvious than the nose, and I also get a little ripe nectarine and apricot - though these are less obvious. This NE IPA thankfully never gives off a rubber band/burnt rubber flavor/feel, but the oat flavor its still tasted in the end.  This offering reminded me a little of some of The Veil's more neutral offerings. The fact that the body-enhancing ingredients don't add an adverse note to the taste is a good thing. But this doesn't really pop with hop-produced juiciness or much bitterness to me.",0.6739969537368329,4.0,0.9435
Scaled Up,"L: Hazy and cloudy burnt orange with a very thin white head S: Dominant notes of orange, grapefruit, and pineapple T: For me the galaxy and nelson hops were the most prominent and came through in big citrus notes as you'd imagine F: Lighter bodied, but evenly carbonated to effect that famous Trillium soft mouthfeel O: Exceptionally drinkable and enjoyable from the beginning to end of the bottle. This ranks up there as another great Trillium hoppy beer and portends great things to come from Canton.",0.6600289154469878,4.75,0.9435
Space Trace,"2018 Bottle. Typical deep dark brown-black appearance with minimal foam around only edge of glass. Very nicely balanced sweet taste up front, with coconut coming out towards the end (and especially so as it warms). There's a good amount of chocolate presence here as well. Bourbon and booziness are well integrated also. Really good mouthfeel. Leaves the lips sticky after a few sips.   A lot of coconut beers make you feel like you're tasting Banana Boat suntan lotion (like Last Buffalo in the Park). This beer however doesn't do that. Coconut is there but because of it's well integrated with chocolate and bourbon sweet flavors, it's is just right.",0.6734075355698986,4.5,0.9435
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Absolutely shocked that I had never reviewed this one before, as I consider it a (the?) defining example of the style.  Golden color, somewhat cloudy. Pours a monster head, creamy and lingering.   Almost a pilsner like spicy note on the nose initially. A soft, slightly sweet and clove nose as it warms a bit. Slight hint of a sweeter fruity banana kind of aroma.   A slightly sweet and clove flavor up front, fairly balanced despite no apparent hop flavors. A very rounded flavor, incredibly smooth with no rough edges. Not overpowering with banana/clove types of flavors - fairly clean palate for a hefe   MF - Medium body and medium to high carbonation. Surprisingly creamy despite the carbonation.   An incredibly easy drinking beer that has the hefeweizen flavor notes without being overpowering.",0.7380994690910755,4.5,0.9434
Double Orange Starfish,"Appearance - Pours thick looks just like orange juice bright orange. Huge thick soapy head that lasts forever. Tons of lacing.  Aroma - Lots of orange, pineapple, tangerine mango, grapefruit and hops.  Taste - Very juicy orange, mango, grapefruit a nice salty flavor as well. It really is like drinking a can of juice, very light bitterness.  Feel - Big full creamy feel so smooth not very dry at all.  Overall - I cannot find much of anything to complain about other than I only have one can. Excellent flavors perfect feel for me and so juicy.",0.6572822260394474,4.75,0.9434
Mastermind,"This is a good beer. I got this one on a trade. Thanks to a great trader! It is definitely interesting. It reminds me a lot of pseudosue, but not nearly as thick a mouthfeel and a little more lingering bitterness on the back of the tongue.   Appearance: Hazy golden color.   Smell: Tropical fruits, some piney resin but not a huge amount going on with this one other than that. Maybe a little sweetness in the malt backbone.   Taste: Very nicely balanced, lots of fruits, honeysuckle, tropical notes and oh so smooth, just a tinge of bitterness on the back of the tongue.   Overall: This is very similar to pseudosue, its a bit more watery, but I don't know if that is really an issue. I would love to have more access to these in the summer months. I am an IPA fiend but I am transitioning to different styles at the moment. Nevertheless, this is a top notch one in my opinion.",0.6838022945901419,4.5,0.9433
Haze,"Poured from can into tulip, good 2 finger cream colored soapy head. Good retention and good lacing. Bright turbid orange in the glass, almost glows. Smells of orange, mango & apricot. Initial taste follows the nose with the addition of mild grapefruit. Slight alcohol on the finish, similar to a mimosa. Mouthfeel on this beer is unbelievable. It is thick and rich and creamy.",0.6642888381529332,4.0,0.9432
Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Thanks to eyebereej for sending this one! Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a Cigar City Brewing goblet.  A: Pours a nearly clear light gold, with just a bit of chill haze. Forms a half-finger's worth of white head that fades quickly atop a very modest amount of visible carbonation.  S: Lightly tart and lemony citric, with barnyard and earthy funk. Light cracker malts underneath.  T: Lemony and citrusy lactic acid, with a middling amount of earthy funk. Light cracker malts. A mild yeast character with minimal black pepper flavor. A mild savoriness along with the tartness, and some Lactobacillus funk. I don’t get much, if indeed any, Brettanomyces character. It stays tart, citrusy and dry in the hang.  M: Light body, low alcohol, and a good amount of carbonation sensation.  O: I thought this was really enjoyable to drink, but really not much saison character. I would have pegged it as a Berliner perhaps. A nice citric lemon tartness, but the saison yeastiness, black pepper, and real barnyard funk are lacking. But if someone handed it to me blind, I'd say it was quite tasty. UPDATE: As it warms some towards the end of the drink, a bit more of the yeasty character comes out, making it seem more like a saison. I decided to score this to overall enjoyment. Rated ""to style"" as a saison, I would estimate 3.25 or so.",0.6828363388430828,4.0,0.9432
Beatification,"A - Pours a citrus yellow with a penny thick white head.  S - Lightly hopped, lots of funk and citrus smell.  T - Lots of malt flavor. Tastes the same across my entire tongue. Lots of citrus and funk. Why must you leave my mouth flavor?  M - Amazing. Perfect combination of carbonation and still yet creamy.   O - Wonderful beer. I'm thankful that I was able to get a couple of bottles!",0.651930227487903,4.5,0.9432
Scaled Up,"I am late to the Trillium bandwagon, but have been to the Fort Point and Canton locations over the last month, and picked up a few bottles of this after trying in the Canton taproon on 12/19. Impressive beer. Not my all time favorite DIPA but an amazing beer with a lot of fragrant tones, more sweet than bitter, but very very hoppy. I can get used to drinking this.",0.5639902306050105,4.5,0.9432
Chocolate Rain,"750mL gold wax shared at Woodshop 7. Pours a full haze mahogany, muddy. Tepid to zero carbonation. Nose is sweet tomato paste, big milk chocolate, sweet bourbon, dark cherry juice. Taste is very sweet, bourbon heavy, loads of brown sugar. Very sticky and cloying. More like an American Strong Ale, no imperial stout character (bitter, roast, hops). More akin to the Firestone Walker anniversary series. Somehow a lighter SRM than Black Tuesday. 7/3/7/3/13=3.3",0.6049469154175634,3.5,0.9432
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Thanks to GRG1313 for sharing this one at mrbubbler's ""end of the world"" tasting.  Bottled 3/5/03.  Pours a murky orange with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with malt, yeast, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with quite an earthy flavor and an acidic finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with some great aromas and flavors.",0.6703557588051541,4.5,0.9432
Double Orange Starfish,"Pours a bright orange hazyness. Smell is the best part of this brew. Straight orange and tangerine. Taste will improve in crowler in time, right now has a light cirrus and orange pith note. Mouthfeel is great. Will update review on taste after I let my crowler sit",0.636406399477202,5.0,0.9432
Flora - Blueberry,"A - Pours a dark purple with a quick dissipating head  S - Strong, juicy, blueberry with a lot of wine-barrel.   T - Blueberry and grape juice is front and center, and overall, another beautiful tasting beer from HF  M - A bit more sour than I was expecting, but likely came from some age. Medium-bodied overall.  O - This is a beautiful BA saison, that is close to perfection.",0.6545194877493896,5.0,0.9432
Vicinity," yellow and super merky with a nice white head that fades quickly. Light lacing. Aroma is pineapple, citrus,oranges, pine and hops. Taste. Citrus, pineapple, orange,pine needles ,hops.

T- Mangoes, pineapple, citrus, limes, tangerines, tropical fruits, piney/dank finish.  M- Smooth, medium body.  O- A fantastic DIPA, feel like the citra hops really shine through! Highly recommend.",0.6147758307022642,4.5,0.9431
Green,"Another excellent beer from Monson. Heavy melon notes, pineapple, less citrus. Awesome mouthfeel. This one had eluded me for a while, but got a fresh 750 bottled this past week that I was more than happy to share.",0.6386442758238192,4.75,0.943
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"It's really hard to rate a beer like this. For what it goes for unless it gave me an orgasm while drinking I don't think it would ever be worth it unless I got it close to face value. That being said I will do my best reviewing it. Had a 2.5 oz. pour of a 2106 bottle at a share. Had side by side with some great stous including SR-71, FVM, Assassin, MBP. This is a really phenomenal maple bomb of a beer with some crazy complexity. Maple dominated the nose and made it a little one dimensional yet it smelled great. Thought the coffee and barrel came through in the flavor. Another great maple beer I thought that I like the taste better as it had more richness to me was 2014 Beyond Good and Evil. The mouthfeel is out of this world though. It's a top notch beer and I would love a chance to have the 14 as 2 guys at the share said that was the very best beer they've ever had. On this day SR-71 stood as king in my eyes. Is it worth the price of admission? No, no beer is worse this much, but I understand why people are willing to pay this much and I do understand the ticker mentality as that is what drove me to try this beer.",0.5648365609925473,4.75,0.9429
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Poured into a brandy snifter with a large tan head. Black as night with just hints of red,showing through.  Aroma of bourbon mash on a highly potent backbone of chocolate, nuts and burnt toffee. Really quite amazing on how much the bourbon dominates a fairly aromatic beer anyway. Flavor is an amazing mix of the peat and charcoal hit of the bourbon with the heavy malts and bitterings of the Expedition. For some reason the burnt characteristics of the regualr Expedition co-mingle so well with charcoally hints in the bourbon notes. Really compliment one another. Mouthfeel is a highyl alcoholic punch of cocoa and charcoal with some resiny bitterness on the finish. Imagine regular Expedition with well blended addition of some peat and charcoal. Drinkability was great, could not have just one. Poured too cold but after it warmed appropriately this was truly a world class beer.",0.6612659140004145,4.5,0.9429
Green,"Poured into Tree House snifter. Hazy gold with one inch off white bubbly, foamy head that slowly dissipates to a nice ring and thin cap.  Aroma is citrusy with notes of pineapple, tangerine, orange, and a hint of grapefruit. The citrus aroma is followed by some earthy/dank and pine/resin notes.  Taste is similar to the nose with lots of citrus flavors and finishes with piney and dank flavors. Taste is very hop forward. Malts are somewhat hidden but provide a creamy base. The aftertaste is a nice mix of sweetness and hop bite.  Medium bodied with a smooth and creamy feel. Light carbonation.  Overall an excellent IPA.",0.6939659592966785,4.75,0.9428
Haze,"16 oz can. Canned 7/5/18. SN Spiegl.   Incredible appearance. Lovely milkshake haze, with a creamy head of 3 fingers, and just gorgeous sheeted lacing around the sides.   Aroma is like a damn gorgeous peach milkshake. Slight papaya, slight acidic orange.   Fuck. Me. Apricots, peaches, papaya, and a finish of orange juice and zest. WOW...Milkshake sweetness throughout. Very very slight herbal bitterness. You cannot top this, not easily.  Feel is creamy, resinous, and supple.   Haze is simply, purely, incredibly incredible. Best Tree House beer and in my top 3 favorite NE IPAs of all time. This thing ages well too.",0.6502732750419412,5.0,0.9428
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2008 bottling poured into a tulip glass.  A- pours a lovely cherry soda red with four fingers of light pink head. Head recedes quickly leaving a small ring of tiny bubbles.   S- Funk, fresh raspberry juice, lactic and acidic notes, and a faint mustiness.   T- Tart. Very sour on the tongue, the acidity gives rise to sour raspberry and a little funk. Hint of grain in the finish.  M- light body, medium to light carbonation. Really dry.   O- what can I say, it's a Lou pepe. It's great, if you can get a bottle or two, you should. Is it my favourite Cantillon? No. That would probably be the Iris, but this is a great beer. It ages well, it pairs well with food and I will never turn down a glass.",0.6292534276126235,4.5,0.9428
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2010 sticker  A - gorgeous light red with hint of pink in color. Aggressively dissipated carbonation.   S - that prototypical Cantillon funk comes at you right out of the box. Bright raspberry, currant and cherries.   T - big raspberry and mild funk. Just a pure and total expression of the style.   M - nice carbonation. Great interplay of sweetness and acidity. Flawless balance.   O - without a doubt, the best framboise I've ever had. Rose de Gambrinus is a great beer and this one is just like RDG, but on steroids.",0.6900426873244245,4.75,0.9428
Second Fiddle,"Now this is an oldschool IPA - and one that I haven't previously reviewed. I was mightily psyched for this check-in.  Second Fiddle is lightly dry and just a bit bitter and piney. It's not your typical New England hazy IPA, and that's totally okay! The balance of sweet, dry, clean, bitter, piney notes is quite pleasant. The ABV is very well disguised. Taste and texture are good - just a bit of syrup to it, but quite drinkable. It's a nice hybrid of oldschool IPA, with some west coast character, and a bit of that hoppy, sweet, NE IPA character.  Well done.",0.6675617321783875,4.25,0.9427
Vicinity,"16oz. can into a Surly teku. 9/7/16 canning date.   Paler than their other offerings but pretty average overall. Aroma is that of starfruit and citrus. Decent but pretty simple. Beer opens honeydew and citrus with some sugary sweetness and syrup in the middle. There's a hint of pine and grass in the back but the hop bitterness is pretty subdued and drowned out by the big tropical fruit malt character throughout. Refreshing, crisp and clean on the palate and bone dry going down and in the finish.   This one doesn't stand out to me... that doesn't mean its not good though. A pretty solid interpretation of a NE IPA.",0.7147853949619548,4.5,0.9427
Nelson,"Outstanding beer. Surprised by the contrast between the aroma, which is all pine needles and pakalolo, and the pour which isn't cloudy or murky at all but rather golden with a light head. Taste is dank (but not sticky) and citrusy, but there's also a slightly smokey and herbal taste. Beautiful dry finish compliments the NZ hops very well. A real gem. At one point I would imagine this was considered very hoppy but in today's world of ever more hop-forward profiles Nelson actually feels more nuanced and subtle. Go figure.",0.6835831006537512,4.25,0.9427
Juicy,"12 fl oz bottle sealed with silver pressure cap.  bottled on 10/10/2015.  poured into HF wine stem.  Appearance: Opaque golden bodied beer with an orange hue. 1 full finger of white head. Head drops down to a thin cap and eventually no head at all.   Smell: Great nose on this beer. Big white wine aroma. Juicy hops just like the name implies.   Taste: Very white wine forward; white grapes, lots of oak, and lots of white wine tannin's. Light tartness. Light bitterness from hops; melon rind, lemon zest, lime zest, green apples, and pineapples. General fruitiness from the hops as well. Earthy character from brett most likely. Hill farmstead's signature funk is present. Lots of nuances and layers here in this beer.   Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low carbonation. Finish is moderately dry and this easily makes up for the low levels of carbonation. The beer does feel a little heavier because of the low levels of carbonation, but the beer also saw extensive time aging in wine barrels (two years according to the label).   Overall: Glad to have finally tried this beer. Been a long time want. While this bottle of Juicy is two and half years old it was still an enjoyable beer. I usually do not care much for hoppy wild beers, but Hill Farmstead made this a beer that is very enjoyable. The white wine character is so big in this beer and it pairs quite well with the flavors of the hops. This beer has several elements about it that remind me quite a bit of an authentic Belgian lambic, but Juicy definitely has an American spin to it.",0.6607429983308492,4.5,0.9426
Sip Of Sunshine,"Finally got my hands on this one. 16oz. can into a Surly teku.   As a relic of pre-NE IPA days, I'm not surprised this one looks fantastic. Goldenrod color, great head, awesome lace. Nose is pine, citrus, pineapple and grass. Surprisingly mellow with a nice sweetness. Beer opens pineapple, citrus and honeydew. Waves of tropical fruit flavor are balanced by a grassy, piney hop bitterness. A touch of cane sugar and more pineapple in the middle with an aggressive hop bite at the end. Great balance. Very drinkable. Body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. Foamy and prickly on the palate and goes down aggressive with a clean, dry finish. Excellent.   A real balanced beer overall. This one doesn't wow you off the bat but it lends itself to be appreciated more and more after every sip.",0.709704072540659,4.5,0.9426
Society & Solitude #4,"On tap at the Hill and poured from growler.  A- hazy yellow and straw like color. A finger if frothy white head.  S- lots of tropical citrus fruits. Grapefruit, peach, and some lemon. Just a touch of pine.  T- very fruity and juicy. Very enjoyable and all the citrus from the nose has not disappeared on the taste. This one was a little different than the other IPAs on tap, as it had a slight bitterness at the end, but it was an enjoyable bitter. Almost a little tart, but very smooth and refreshing.  M- medium bodied, a smooth light creaminess with medium carbonation.  O- another really great IPA from HF. I feel like this brewery can't mess up a beer. I could drink this or any if their beers all day, every day.",0.6807153995531448,4.75,0.9425
Green,"16oz can dated 8/30/17.  Pours milky yellow with a dense, frothy head of white. Nice lacing with decent retention. Aromatics are floral and almost pungent. White grapes, candied pear, peach, mango, and pineapple. Medium bodied with a soft, fluffy mouthfeel. Tropical fruit on the palate with juicy overtones and a light bitterness. Zero malt with loads of ripe citrus. Finishes with lingering lush citrus and super smooth.   Great beer. Plenty of hoppy, juicy goodness without being harsh or tiring, The mouthfeel is amazingly soft and lush especially when the glass is swirled. Almost as good as Galaxy Cutting Tiles!",0.7150387980474497,4.5,0.9425
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"75cl bottle drank at the brewery in Brussels. Poured into 25cl Cantillon glass  pours a brillant dark pink color, foamy white head that fades. But lively carbonation. the Raspberry flavor is nice without the over sweetness of other brewery's Fruited Lambics, this has the nice pleasant refreshing tartness that drinks well. thin bodied.",0.6202400958637586,4.5,0.9424
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"A: Beautiful opaque light burgandy color with a very small head. Still not as stunning as some of the bright red cantillon's I have had, but really nice none the less.   S: This is the quality of the beer that really shines through. Fresh baked bread, pie cherries, candy sugar, light vinegar, and a bit of funk and oak in the finish. Perfect.  T: The taste starts out blindingly tart with some astringency in the finish. Given the cherry flavors are still phenominal, they are just dominated by the tartness. No funk or oak flavors are noticable at all. I wonder if I had an off bottle because normally Drie Fonteinen is known for their amazing blance in flavors (a la Drie Fonteinen Gueuze). A bit of a disappointment.  M: Great body and carbonation levels. No complaints here.  O: With a bit less tartness this would hold up the the Lou Peppe Kriek. However, for the time being Cantillon takes the crown in my opinion.",0.6674913821091536,4.0,0.9423
Swish,"Pours a hazy, turbid bright yellow almost wit like. Nosh is fresh! Fresh citrus, fresh topical notes, fresh doughy yeast. Taste of ""juicy"" Orange and mangos.

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"2016 bottle poured into a teku.  Look is super viscous and opaque. Minimal to no head.  Smell is all bourbon and fudge. Smells so decadent.  Taste is bourbon fudge. Not overly boozy and had a finish with some dark fruits. As it warmed, vanilla and caramel flavors poppped from the bourbon. Feel was again very thick. Coated the glass and my mouth. Lingered on the palate. Overall, an outstanding beer. Worthy of the hype and one of the best BA stouts I’ve tried.",0.6449066438576323,4.75,0.9423
Chocolate Rain,"Pours a dark brown, almost black color, with a fizzy, hazelnut brown lacing, immediately collapsing to a tiny film at the edge of the glass.  Has a profound milk chocolate aroma, blending into coconut shell and flowery, warming vanilla. Its vanilla quality grows more profound, once detected, complimenting earthy oak and fudge, with a fizzy coca-cola sweetness.   Features almost no carbonation, exhibiting a smooth, big body, due to a hot, profound oakiness, balanced by burned earth and a flowery quality.  Begins with toffee supported vanilla bean among scorched earth and bitter chocolate chips. The Bourbon barrel adds a warming glow to the tongue, which amazingly enough never turns hot or boozy, as well as spiced, dry wood bark. Mocha sweetness, together with rock sugar and a pleasant chocolate bitterness create a thrilling interplay, wrapped up by the omnipotent barrel, including a huge amount of vanilla. Finishes with a mix of earthen malts and a spicy dryness, creating a palate challenging finish, which lasts on the tongue for minutes. After that dryness, a late caramel coated milk chocolate quality evolves, creating a mellowing, silk last impression.   While its nose features a focussed, minimalistic approach, the beers full potential unfolds on the palate, in all its heavy-bodied facetts. It is certainly well executed, but for my personal taste, this is just a tad too over the top. Its richness overburdens my palate, it needs to chill down for a couple of minutes after each sip, which is basically not how a beer works for me. This is closer to being a liquour for me, on which I can sip from time to time. We split the bottle through three people and had problems to finish it.",0.7074766905515669,3.5,0.9423
Enjoy By IPA,"A: Wonderfully clear and golden. Excellent lacing.  S: Sweet pine, peach, and citrus.   T: Clean and crisp. Citrus fruits, juicy peach, and pine.   M: Light and sticky. Once again crisp and clean. Exceptionally easy to drink.   O: I’ve been drinking IPAs for awhile, and a lot of them. This big guy is probably my all time favorite. This beer is the quintessential example of what a double IPA should be. It is old school. It doesn’t chase fads. It focuses on hops. Brewers that have simply labeled unfiltered IPAs as “NE Style“ should take notice of this bad boy and bow down accordingly.",0.6711682082171881,4.75,0.9423

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Enjoyed at Dark Lord Day 2010.  Appearance: Black, thick, no head to speak of.  Smell: Luscious.  Taste: As I drank this, I honestly thought that it was a taste of Heaven itself. Malty. Vanilla. Chocolate. Coffee. Clearly oak-aged. Absolutely heavenly.  Mouthfeel: Sooo smooth and thick. It reminded me of silk or velvet.   Drinkability: If not for the ABV I could drink it for all eternity.",0.6214996144818264,4.5,0.9422
Swish,"The Julius of Bissell Brothers. Just released today, and absolutely perfect! Juicy, hazy, smooth mouthfeel - everything an NEIPA could and should be. Worth the wait this morning!

Chocolate Rain,"The Rain pours down in an alluring brown murkiness that holds a deeply thick and robust crown of Brown foam.  The aroma hits sharply with a snap of alcohol but then settles in with coconut and vanilla. Deeper in the aroma starts to really penetrate deep in the nose with fudgy chocolate and molasses.  The fudge, chocolate and brownie like flavors burst on the palate as the finish ends with cream and whiskey notes.  The feel is smooth and quite thick. The alcohol is imperceptible but for a warmth that enters the body and gives you a happy feeling all over.",0.6477674743946662,4.5,0.9421
Nelson,Another great beer from Alpine. Poured a lighter golden yellow color into my tulip glass. The nose more floral than citrus with a lingering pine nose. The taste is slightly bitter but lacking in tropical fruits or much of this nature. The taste complex to me more so than most IPA's are but I am enjoying it. A good beer I'll look forward to enjoying again.,0.6929889997463538,4.25,0.9418
Sip Of Sunshine,"This is a super solid DIPA. The smell is bursting with dank sticky hops, over ripe fruits, and a hint of honey sweetness. The taste is balanced leaning towards hoppy with firm bitterness. This is what a DIPA should really be. Some reviewers seem to be under the impression this is a NEIPA but it is not. It's a proper American IPA - solid malt backbone balanced perfectly with huge hop flavors, and ending with a strong bitter finish. yb",0.7098170176514502,4.5,0.9418
Aaron,"Served at a bottleshare side-by-side with Olde Hickory Omega Point.  The color is inviting; this is a barleywine you want to put to your lips, hazy but consistent. Smell is sweet without any edges, taste is the same -- smooth, with some booze and a very mellow barrel flavor.  Consider this to be like fraternal twins with OP; perfectly complementing without having too many similarities.",0.6877473882808586,4.5,0.9418
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"It looks motor oil thick and used motor oil black and shiny in the glass. Minimal dark tan head rests on top and quickly diffuses into spotty islands of lace and a thin ring around. The aroma is huge vanilla, oak, bourbon, and dark bakers chocolate. Taste is Ah-mayze-ing! Super rich dark chocolate is the first thing that hits me, followed by some tobacco, vanilla, oak, a little coffee, and some slight bourbon heat on the finish. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected, but still on the full side of medium. Oily, slick, coating my mouth at all angles with a dry finish but NOT chalky. Overall this is fantastic and every bit worthy of its high marks.",0.6554120888783905,5.0,0.9417
Swish,"Pint can (3/23/18) poured into a fat Duvel tulip glass on 3/30/18   A thick, totally opaque orange and gold color with white hazy tints. Robust, all-white foam topping. Bubbly and dense. Surprisingly, the foam eventually totally fades away. Minimal lacing.   The aroma popping out of this glass is very strong. A multitude of fruity hop effects, including : peppery citrus, mango, peppery alcohol heat,...big citrus and tropical combo. The malt gives a certain sweetness and earthiness from the wheat. This is the quintessential New England Style DIPA nose. Bold and beautiful hops.   Oh. Sh!%+ !! The density and complexity of this hoppy liquid is unreal. The mouthfeel and texture is about as heavy, full and lush as it gets for this style. Deep, citrus follwed by a biting earthiness from the hops. Pineapple, grapefruit, mango, orange peel...?it's all in there. The malt aspect is also very impressive with a light toned but heady dose of wheat and a crisp but long bite. The light effect and crisp bite turns into slick and full pretty fast to the finish. Orange rind, black pepper, mango and starfruit type flavor dominates in the end. Complexity and depth of hoppy charecter is off the charts.  A full bodied DIPA and huge complexity makes this a true sipper. Not very crushable due to it's heady nature. Take time to ponder it's full-on hop attack slowly! There are some sour, malty risiduals with a bigger than average alchol kick that also limits it's crushability. This thing is destroying my tastebuds. Saturating my palate. I'm done.",0.7291880122983859,4.5,0.9417
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"A 750ml bottle at the brewery. 2013 sticker, bottled on 3rd April 2016. Poured into a Cantillon tasting glass.  Appearance: It poured a clear dark ruby colour with a three finger dark pink head that had decent retention and some sparse lacing. Looks so good.  Aroma: Fruity raspberry, strawberry and some light floral notes.  Taste: Sour, tart, raspberry, strawberry, oak, apple and light barnyard funk.  Mouthfeel: Dry, light bodied with moderate carbonation.  Overall: So good. Such nice refreshing raspberries and strawberries. Could very well be my favourite fruit lambic! Must buy.",0.6582046713818468,5.0,0.9416
Sip Of Sunshine,"The great debate seems to be Sip of Sunshine or Heady Topper, I don't think it's fair to claim one over the other as beer tastes are so personal (if you don't like IPA's you won't like this beer, not matter how good it is) but my votes for Sip of Sunshine. It's balances bright notes with a full body wonderfully. If I could I would drink this beer every day.",0.6026957706173574,4.75,0.9415
Black Tuesday,"2014 all to myself. Not as ominous looking as I was expecting. Fantastic big nose though. Fanastic big taste. Not as refined as bourbon county heat wise, but much bigger as well. Enjoyed Monday better, still have Wed and Rain to go.",0.5837175729528881,4.25,0.9415
Beatification,"Poured from the bottle into a Chimay goblet. The bottle is dated 011012.  Appearance: Pours a clear light golden/straw color with a thick layer of fluffy white head. The head fades quickly and leaves a small layer and a ring on top of the pour.  Smell: Very light and extremely sour smelling. Definitely getting some funk and some hay/barn type smells. There is just a hint of lemon juice in the sour notes.  Taste: This is an extremely sour beer. The overall flavor is light and crisp. It's full of tart lemon, some white vinegar, and some funk. In the finish I'm getting some slightly herbal flavor that reminds me of aged hops. This one kind of reminds me of a very sour lambic.  Mouthfeel: The body is on the light side of medium with a good amount of fluffy carbonation and a very dry finish.  Overall: This is a really sour, really good beer. It may be slightly one dimensional, but it's really good at what it aims to do. I really enjoyed this and will search out more in the future.",0.6828826264805448,4.5,0.9415
Society & Solitude #4,"&lt;2 week old growler, thanks to parkingphi  A: 1cm white head over hazy apricot beer. Splotchy lacing.  S: Papaya, peach, a touch of grape and light floral notes.  T: Lots of juicy, tropical fruit (papaya, mango) finishing with a bit of resin  M: Moderate carbonation, pretty good for a growler fill. Good impression of body, although not in a malty way, more like a juice. Just slightly sticky on the lips in the second glass.  O: Really juicy delicious IPA.",0.6398999054916248,4.5,0.9414
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"Looks black in the glass with a ring of foam that lingers. Smell is coffee, lactose, and a hint of chocolate. Reminds me of jwakefields cafe but with a bit more going on. Taste is much more chocolatey than the smell. Kind of like Hershey's milk chocolate. Feel is pretty spot on for the style. Silky smooth and light. Overall a great light chocolatey coffeeish stout.",0.6403253378121354,4.25,0.9414
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Pours a rich, golden hue of orange with an opaque transparency. Head foams up to two fingers in height and white in color, and retains well with a few dashes of lacing left behind. Aroma is orange and citrusy, floral and earthy, and dank. Lots of hop qualities that all perform well, and avoid the citrus dripping aromas of similar beers. Flavor profile is citrus, floral, earthy, and dank. Orange juice notes intertwine to develop an interesting flavor profile. Interesting in the sense that it's in-ordinary, and yet is flavored extremely well with a balance that leans more on the sugary side of the sweet vs. bitter. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a smooth texture that only has a fine amount of fizz to it. Overall, this beer drinks resoundingly smooth, with an interesting hop profile. The variation from the typical hop notes spewed by beers of this style, paired with the smooth feel makes this one incredible ""North East"" IPA.   Served in a 12oz snifter.",0.7314409897667491,4.5,0.9413
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"375 ml bottle. Pitch black, no head or lace to speak of. Sweet sugary and bourbon aroma. This is a powerful tasting brew. Bourbon and chocolate, can taste the maple, burnt sugar. The flavors really blend well as this beer warms. Good balance of boozy n sweet. Medium slick mouthfeel, slightly oily. Impressed by this one.",0.6740930344286294,4.5,0.9413

Undercurrent of tartness throughout most of the beer and then finishes quite sour, also finishes with a pretty sharp bitterness  M- Light boded, very low carbonation, it does finish a little watery and became more watery as it warmed up some  O- The flavor and aroma are nice, but not as complex or pleasant as the Seizoen Bretta I had just two weeks ago. The mouthfeel held this back for me quite a bit, a little too watery but a nice brett beer. Can't believe this is 10%, it drinks like a 4%, very light.",0.6610696095016171,4.0,0.9413

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Had this at DLD '10.  I was walking a bit warm by the time I got to try this, but had it a second time side by side with DL. I don't know if I would have been able to compare them unless I had them next to each other. DL is amazing, but the OA is even better. The oak aging does wonders to tone down the sweetness of DL...making it more drinkable IMO.",0.5485928000109818,5.0,0.9413

Enjoy By IPA,"Clear amber with head that dies down. YUUUUGE aroma. Pine, grapefruit, sweet mango and peach in the aroma. I don't know what dank is in a beer, but the taste has powerful resiny spiciness, booze on the finish, assertive bitterness, and subdued bready malts. Incredibly intense and unique taste. A great DIPA. Heads and shoulders above Enjoy by Unfiltered.",0.6724306128841929,4.25,0.9412
Peche 'n Brett,"Poured from the 750 bottle into a large tulip. Pours a rich and glowing honey color with depth. Huge soapy head. Aromas are unique combination of brett yeast and peach. Taste is complex. The brett is tamped down by the peach but they mix to create something unique. Moutfeel was very nice. Overall this beer is unique, complex and delicious. Tons of fruit here.",0.715314778053903,4.25,0.9412
Beer:Barrel:Time,"Saved this one for beer #6,000. Great decision on my part if I do say so. This is an incredibly rich and complex stout, with layer of luxurious depth. Fudge, vanilla, molasses, roasted nuts, coffee, oak, caramel, and of course a healthy smattering of bourbon. Smell not as smoky or deep as taste, more focused on chocolate, vanilla, and barrel, but otherwise twins. Body is so textured and varied I can chew on it, even with booze burst at finish. Truly a special beer",0.7081824476849844,4.75,0.9412

Sip Of Sunshine,Found this fresh randomly in a shop in Philly.  Was super excited to see this and had to buy 2 4packs (even though $20 a 4pack is obscene)  A very good beer but not nearly as good as I expected this to be. I've had better homebrew and local IPAs. It's damn good but not what I was expecting,0.4911415700406746,4.5,0.9411
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"This brew has been on my bucket list for a while. Thanks to Clark and the gang for busting it out at EBS when they were in town!   A: Dark and chocolaty. Nice head to it, even for a taster S: Has notes of maple syrup, coffee and chocolate T: AMAZING! The syrup really comes through. There is an oakyness there as well. Simply blown away!

Nelson,"Kinda of biased because it is my favorite IPA in SD and I can go to the brewery anytime. I'm finally reviewing it because Green Flash is now making this beer for Alpine, which I had my reservations. After drinking a few batches, I can honestly say it taste the same as the original that I've come to enjoy many years ago. It is definitely a must try especially if your new to the craft beer scene. Cheers!",0.5111160215479994,5.0,0.941
Nelson,"January 14, 2016  16.6 oz. bottle, tulip  A – Medium gold, bright even though it’s mildly hazy. An inch of somewhat craggy, bright white foam sits atop the liquid, with long slow retention.   S – Grapefruit juice, a touch of kiwi, and lemon spritzer all contribute to a strong, dominant hop profile. Light, crackery malt with a bit of sourdough bread impression.   T – A whole lot of grapefruit, perhaps of the ruby red variety, with a light lemon note in the background. Flour/cracker malt profile. Bitterness comes and goes but is strong on the finish and aftertaste.  M – Slightly sweet and slick, not as sudsy/carbonated as it appears to be, though still moderate. Medium body. Bitterness rises and takes over on the finish. At no point is there any real balance are harmony.  O – Fantastic aroma and flavor, lacking in the mouthfeel. Never quite feels cohesive.",0.7173362794189001,3.75,0.9409
Enjoy By IPA,"Substantial clarity, looks professional as can be. Even manages almost a full inch of head on it, something amazing given the massive amount of hops/hop oil here.  Got them proprietary tropical fruit hops working to the bone here. Good stuff. Super dry mouthfeel and taste, hops seem to be in the amarillo/citra/simcoe vein. Not a lot of bitterness. Alcohol easily covered up. Damn good stuff, no need to chase small bottle counts when Stone kills it like this, especially in the six pack format.",0.6448117292637567,4.5,0.9409
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"It angers me to write this. I really wanted this beer to be super overrated and to just be a product of Midwest people pumping up their instawalez. It's not. This is the best beer I've ever had. Smell, taste, lacing, everything is perfect. It smells like maple syrup with a hint of bourbon. It tastes like smooth maple syrup with a hint of bourbon.

Beatification,"Batch 4. So glad I'm finally getting to try this. Pours a slightly hazy, bright gold color with a medium white head that goes down quickly. Scent is funky with nice lemon aromas. There is also a bit of sweat aroma in the nose as well. Lovely wild yeast scents and citrus with just the right amount of funk. Taste is very oaky at first with intense lemon and sharp, bitter funk from the wild yeast. A bit of cheese as well. Nice blend of lemon, funk, and sour. Mouthfeel is very crisp and refreshing. Puckering. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is the first time I've had this beer, and RR has yet to disappoint.

Todd The Axe Man,"Can dated 6/13/17. Poured into Teku glass.  L: Mostly clear brilliant golden. 2F head with OK retention, leaves spotty lacing and a little ring.  S: Very nice tropical fruit and citrus notes. Pineapple, mango, grapefruit, and orange. Some pine. Crystal malts, maybe?  T: Generally follows nose with good flavor despite not-very-fresh can. More grapefruit and orange than tropical. Slightly bitter finish. No ABV in evidence.  F: Mediumish body, pretty lively carbonation (probably too much). Construction is good, balance pretty good. Good drying, pretty refreshing for this style of IPA.  O: Not quite as good as on tap, but for a can of this age, high marks indeed.",0.6899212347448089,4.25,0.9408
Space Trace,"Coconut snowflakes float along the surface of this pitch black beer. Thin, brown bubbles quickly retreat to the sides of the glass. Aroma is coconut cream, chocolate brownie, toffee candy, and bourbon soaked oak. Taste is more bourbon forward. Its a big, full bourbon flavor that seems to be evidence of time spent in the barrel. Rich dark fruit, vanilla, and toasted coconut reminiscent of the best bcbs vintages. It has some roast and smoke to it and that adds character. Coconut butter cream frosting is the icing on this chocolate cake. Mouth feel is full and carbonation is on point. This is almost a 4.75, but I prefer to see the base beer come through a little more. This is excellent and well worth the cost to acquire.",0.6231682268504728,4.5,0.9408
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,Pours a cloudy straw yellow color. Aroma is hoppy and pineapple citrus. Flavor is clean citrus peel with a pineapple like acidity to the citrus.

Flora,"Batch 6. Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Hill Farmstead stemmed wine glass.   Pours a slightly hazy orange body with a big frothy white head that leaves spotty lacing and a layer of retention.   Aromas are mesmerizing, citrus and tart green apple, funk and oak, brett, peppery saison yeast. As it warms the aromas get more potent and inviting. Can't wait to try it.   On the tongue is a balanced, delicate tartness, citrus and dry tart fermented fruit, delicious funk, peppery yeast, moderate oak presence on the follow through. Easy drinker, crisp and delicate, medium carbonation and light but flavorful body.   A true showcase of how micro-flora can work to make a beer world class. Amazing.",0.7139860016405659,4.5,0.9406
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,Poured into a Sierra Nevada Spiegelau glass. Bottom of can says 01/17/17.  A- Pours a turbid medium amber color with a full inch of off-white head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a mostly full sheet of sheer surface foam. Resilient lacing leaves a thick solid ring behind.  S- Smells like Froot Loops with a bit of dank green quality in the back.  T- Tangy stone fruit from the hops and a bit of sweet malt presence to balance. Low bitterness and dangerously drinkable for the ABV.  M- Nice and soft but also crisp. Medium carbonation and a body leaning toward the lighter side.  O- Another fantastic IPA from these guys. I feel like it's only slightly more impressive than the regular but that's still saying something given how tasty the regular is.,0.7007271001648171,4.5,0.9405
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"This one startled me - my expectations of Tree House stouts has just continuously dropped as I've had more, so I overlooked All that Is more than just a bit. I recently received a can in a BIF group - decided to share it with some friends at a local restaurant.  Jesus. What a mistake! Should have stayed home, turned off the lights and lit some candles - this should have been a romantic experience!  Soft, delicious, roasty coffee. Creamy. Sweet. I cannot articulate how much depth and dimension this beer has. For a canned stout, WTF - this is incredible. I'm very impressed - Tree House is back on my stout list with this beer. Looking forward to trying more... of this one in particular. Amazing!",0.6318116832358923,4.75,0.9403
Green,"Pours like turbid grapefruit juice with a dense foamy head. As the beer is consumed the head leaves bands of sticky lacing. There is a lot of pineapple and other citrus fruits in the nose. Perhaps a bit of melon and some pine as well. The taste is pineapple, a bit of sweetness and a spectacular bitter hop finish. This beer is medium bodied and creamy. This is a truly balanced and delicious beer with a great mouthfeel.",0.6917194963990271,4.5,0.9403

Chocolate Rain,"Reviewed from notes. On-tap for the Third Anniversary Party at the Phoenix Club. 5/29/11.  A: Pours an oily, deep black with a faint dark tan head which leaves a couple of spots.  N: Dark cocoa powder, milk chocolate, roast, vanilla, dark fruits, boozy, molasses, warm caramel and maple.  T: Complex. Dark chocolate, vanilla, caramel, bourbon, brown sugar, aged wood, charred leather. Amazing.  M: Full body and light carbonation. Rich, oily, creamy, sweet, syrupy, bourbon soaked chocolate cake.  O: Stunning and in awe.",0.6142111187499858,2.5,0.94
Haze,"Canned on 9/26/18; consumed on 9/27/18. Pretty much as fresh as you can get it. . . .  A: Poured from the can into a Palm tulip. Body is hazy golden-yellow with a small off-white head that settles quickly, leaving behind some splotchy lace.  S: Big nose of hop juice. Think grapefruit, more generic citrus (tangerine peel, lemon), peach skins, nectarines and even under-ripe plums.  T: Taste doesn't quite live up to the nose in sheer forcefulness, but it's quite pleasant. Kinda like pineapple-orange juice, with loads of grapefruit, ripe mangoes, and stone fruit (apricot) all present at one time or another. Finishes with a more green bitterness - pine or grass comes to mind - which washes over the palate but is quickly overtaken by the more sweet juiciness of oranges, grapefruit and even limes.   M: Juicy and smooth, call it medium in heft but it feels a little lighter.   O: Awesome. Incredible. Phenomenal. Pick a word.",0.654476723524969,4.5,0.94
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Thanks to Kyle for contributing this to New Beer Sunday. Served in a Hopleaf tulip glass. 2005 Vintage. My notes on this one are a little shorter as it was the last beer I reviewed in a long session.  A - Two and a half fingers of pink-white foam with solid retention. Absolutely no lace, but a nice cap of foam that lingers for a bit. Opaque pink-brown brew.  S - Tons of vinegar, brett-y funk, raspberries, horse blanket, and musty barn. Utterly huge smell that almost attacks the senses.  T - Huge sourness, with sweet raspberry puree right at the tip of the tongue. Lots of funk and a light graham-cracker maltiness that holds things together.  M - Super drying, tons of cotton mouth, light to medium body, moderate carbonation. More extreme in mouth pucker than even La Folie!  D - So sour - even with low ABV it's hard to have more than a a serving or two. I appreciate that Dave had the Pepto out just in case of emergency.

Enjoy By IPA,"I've drunk a lot of IPAs, Double IPAs, Imperial IPAs, and Triple IPAs--This is the tastiest brew I've ever had in my life! It approaches perfection like no other. A friend gave me two four packs of cans for my March 30th 70th birthday, which we drank on the use by date with other appropriate consumables--we were flying! I drank another can last night, more than three months past the use by date, and it was still absolutely superlative. Other than Dogfish 90, I prefer my strong IPAs lighter in color and this one is literally the light gold standard. Though it says its danky, I find its hop taste far from the dankiest. Rather its hoppy clear and true. I have one more can. I wish I had a case. It just doesn't get any better.",0.5905023819186233,4.75,0.9399
Green,"Finally got my hands on my first tree house! After all these trades, finally led to Green.  Pour is a beautiful murky golden orange. Very hazy and milky like pour. Small head with great lacing.  Smell is everything you can want in an IPA. Very tropical upfront, tangerines, mango, grapefruit, pineapple, more pineapple,citrus zest, lemon peel, orange.. The list goes on. Very tropical nose and not much malt or bitter presence.  Taste is a burst of what the nose offers, plus more. Insane amount of fruit here with a very subtle hop backbone, very sweet malt backbone.   Mouthfeel is creamy, light carbonation. Almost a dole or orange juice mouthfeel with all the bursts of juices going on.  Amazing beer.. First tree house and does not disappoint.

Beatification,"A: Pours a very clear, very bright golden color with about a one and a half finger soapy white head. Lots of carbonation visible  S: Lots of lemon, lots of vinegar kind of smells, a very good amount of an herbal funkiness.  T: Taste follows the nose fairly well, lots of tartness mostly, the funk was a little lost here. It was still there, but not as much as the nose led me to believe. I'll have to see if that changes through aging though, which may be the case. Very sour with lots of lemon and vinegar though.  M: A bit thicker than I expected, but not a ""thick beer"" by any means. Extremely dry and it feels like the acid just ripped all the enamel off my teeth.  Overall this was pure awesomeness. My favorite sour from RR and one of my favorite beers overall. I can't to see what some more age does to these beasts.",0.6382855289582389,5.0,0.9398

Todd The Axe Man,"Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 16 oz. can into an El Catador teku glass.  A: Pours a hazy darkish gold with a good amount of visible carbonation. Forms a finger's worth of white wheat that fades fairly quickly.  S: Tropical fruits, dank, and melon hops. Tangerine and resin as well. Just a hint of biscuit malts lurking underneath. A nice aroma for sure.  T: Tropical fruits, tangerines, and dank. A modest biscuit malt sweetness. Melon and a bit of pine and floral bitterness. More juicy tropical fruits and a modest bitterness in the hang.  S: Medium body, with good carbonation sensation. The alcohol stays fairly restrained.  O: I really liked this one. A solid IPA, and one that would likely be in a rotation if it were regularly available on the shelves here. Nice tropical and orangey fruits. It’s a little more malty than a good number of current IPAs, but there’s no caramel flavors nor is it overly sweet. I'm not sure it lived up to the hype, but solid for sure.",0.6900386973784135,4.0,0.9398
Second Fiddle,Poured from a can into Teku glass; dark amber color not very opaque. Smells and tastes hoppy with a crisp and piney finish. Felt more like a west coast IPA than a typical NE IPA but great feel nonetheless.

Oude Geuze Vintage,"This rating refers to a special version of the 2002 vintage geuze, the same red label as the 50th anniversary geuze. The bottles were sold recently at the brewery. It is a special blend and not the same beer as the regular vintage geuze from 2002. The bottle looks really wonderful, handwritten date on the backside. Cork pops easily from the bottle. Looks good in the glass, very zippy, huge head. Wonderful complex sourish aroma. Starts woody-sourish, shows lemon notes, not too aggressive. Finish is getting milder, but still intense sourish, a bit woody. Prickly aftertaste, lasts long. Wonderful balanced. Extremely drinkable. I'm flashed!",0.6778454551999675,4.5,0.9398
Beatification,"Beatification Batch 3 Wild ale brewed in the Gueuze way if I am not mistaken.  750 ml cork and caged bottle enjoyed at Monk's Table. Split with a friend. Poured into a tall, flute like glass. Feels good to slay a whale!  Clear golden with a good white head. Very carbonated, almost fizzy. Aroma is funk, lactic acid and diaper. Tastes intensely and insanely sour with notably less funk compared to the aroma. Strong lemon, medium oak with a slightly tannic and bitter finish.  Very very crisp and bone dry, although the later part of the bottle drank slightly mellower. I like it by all means but I don't see the demand. It was worth the 50 dollars spent only because of its reputation. Assuming that it is fair to compare it to other Gueuze, it's not top shelf.  4, 4, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5",0.6638931873309581,3.5,0.9397
Peche 'n Brett,"750ml bottle poured into tasting glass  A — Pours an orangey hazy color into the glass, there is a puffy white head that settles out and leaves a spot or two of lacing behind.  S — Smells of fresh peaches and light funky brett. Really peach forward and fresh, just ridiculous how fresh and juicy this smells.  T — Tastes lightly sweet and super juicy, little bit of a funky brett balance as well, yeasty, lightly phenolic.  M — Medium bodied, little to no alcohol presence, can't believe this is 10.0% ABV, just super refreshing and light.  O — Fantastic overall, errs on the sweet side, I would love this with a little bit of sour, but as it is, it's freaking great.",0.6539734248611485,4.25,0.9397
Mastermind,"Canned 9/30/16, drinking 11/16/16. Poured into a teku, the beer is a bright yellow gold with a slight hazy and a thin white film, after the initial head quickly fades, leaving nice lacing.  The aroma is so unique and excellent. The yeast plays a bigger part in this than most IPAs; the aroma reminds berries, then tropical fruit.  Berries and pineapple are in the taste as well. The malt character is a slight rye bread. Mouthfeel is relatively light in body. Good carbonation, yet this could be a sipper if it's following a few other beers. This particular one I'm having first, and it's quite drinkable. I'm a bigger fan of Second Fiddle, but this is great in its own right.",0.6859689713177992,4.25,0.9396
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2013 cork with 2010 sticker served at 55 degrees and poured into Hill Farmstead stem  Appearance is deep pinkish ruby red with pencil thin white head. Head dissipates quickly and the aroma of fresh raspberry immediately takes over. Taste is like fresh squeezed raspberry, not overly sweet with nice dry, sour finish . There is also a nice complex funk throughout. Mouthfeel is near perfect with slight carbonation.   Overall this beer is really remarkable and did not disappoint. I've had a few batches of Atrial, Lolita, Rosé De Gambrinus, Upland, etc which are all great but the complex layers of this beer really shine and push it slightly above the other raspberry sours. Definitely seek this out.  overall rating: 4.75",0.7075487158850677,5.0,0.9396
Oude Geuze Vintage,"11/27/10  2002 with the old red label and a hand written date.  A: Beautiful vibrant dark orange with great clarity and a big frothy white head, great retention.  S: A nice balance of citrus, oak, tannins, and wet leather. Very expressive, yet exhibits excellent balance. Barnyard, hay, some light cheese notes. Really opens up after 20 minutes.  T: Light tartness and low lactic sour notes up front with moderate oak notes and some tannins. Leather, cheese, some citrus notes, and a light acidity. Finish seems to drop off quickly, with just a little lingering oak and tannins.  M: lower high level of carbonation. Dry mouthfeel with tannic notes.  Overall: A nice Gueuze, but lacks the complexity I'd hoped for, especially in the finish.",0.7229212370837035,4.0,0.9396
Green,"Canned 2/7/17... so fresh!  L: Hazy orange, thin head of foam, good amount of lacing. S: Strong hop aroma as soon as you crack the can. T: So hoppy up front with a good dose of bitterness, but quickly fades to tropical fruit a la so many of the Treehouse IPAs. Noticeable booze taste at the tail end, to be expected for 7.6%. F: Dry compared to other ""juicy"" East coast IPAs, but I like that!  O: Not as intriguing as Julius but satisfies that hop-packed IPA desire. Challenges for top 5 IPAs I've had up til now.",0.6247205929506465,5.0,0.9394
Vicinity,"Poured 6 weeks after brewing into a snifter. Thanks to crubbsy for the trade!  L: Color is exactly like unfiltered creamed honey with a small, quickly fading white head. S: Grapefruit, resiny hops, slight maltiness. Decent, but not strong. T: Everything from the smell, but balanced and smooth. Easy drinking, with slight bitter aftertaste, but nothing that screams unique. F: Love the slick, robust, unfiltered mouthfeel. A bit more carbonation than I expected from the head. O: Enjoyable but not particularly memorable. At 8% ABV it's hardly a DIPA, and it drinks more like an IPA than a DIPA.",0.6902816854073027,4.0,0.9393
Black Tuesday,"Super black, brown head, 1/5"". Keep the carbonation low, appropriate for this kind of beer.  Aroma was massive amounts of chocolate and bourbon, just huge.   Taste was more of the same, lots of vanilla. Even some tobacco and leather edge. The godfather of huge bourbon barrel beers. So many imitators since.  Great with a cigar. Awesome stuff.",0.6007921571653647,4.75,0.9393

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"From memory...10 oz pour @ the brew pub, so this one was in glass and not plastic. I remember them saying it was from '08.  A: Big, bold, and black like DL. More head from this guy than the vanilla bean DL from what I remember.  S: Big bold roasted malt, bourbon, chocolate, molasses, alcohol.  T: The barrel adds what I picked up as bourbon and some dryness akin to oak barrels. This guy felt bigger than any of the other DLs, ABV is probably the same, but bourbon characteristics made it seem higher. Great up front roast, not as much sweetness as the other variants of DL, but big dry finish.  M: Thick and viscous, would not have it any other way.  D: Another way to celebrate DLD and will try this guy again next year. Big beers are wanted by my taste buds.",0.5830525825939114,4.0,0.9392
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"2011 750mL shared among seven. Kicking myself for not buying both bottles on the shelf at 35.99 in 2013.  This is an absolutely beautiful lambic. This bottle had no overpowering sourness mentioned in other reviews, also no medicine.   Amazingly clean with subtle funk, cherry, lightly sour, light body, mild carb with almost no pop when the cork came out, but nicely effervescent when swished. Again, it's a shame I didn't get both dusty bottles off the shelf. I would love to have this again, maybe with a few less people. Everyone absolutely loved it, even the ""i don't really like sours"" guy at the share.",0.6250848409830876,4.75,0.9392
Nelson,"I had it on tap at the Dive Bar NYC. It poured an eye catching hazy golden orange color. It had a thumb nail length frothy head that retained nicely. The lacing also retained well and was sticky. In the nose I got a nice scent of citrusy orange peel and grapefruit pith. Next, I became aware of rye bread characteristics. As the drink progresses, I become more aware of herbal and even dank hops characteristics. Overall, quite pleasing to the nose. Going down the hatch, it feels smooth, initially sweet and citrusy. There are some bready and even slightly doughy attributes that provide a nice malt backbone. There is a white wine like dryness throughout. As the drink progresses, a nice moderate hops bitterness that is herbal, spicy and resiny. The body is medium but feels on the light side because it drinks so fast. This is a delicious IPA.",0.701126351862691,4.5,0.9392
Chocolate Rain,"This was an interesting beer for sure. Opened a fresh 2017. Had a dark amber color. Aroma was chocolate and boozy with some sweetness. Flavor was still a little hot from the abv but still delicious. Lots of bourbon, chocolate and some vanilla. Drank a little lighter Thani expected. Overall really enjoyable.",0.6484495495709428,4.25,0.9392
Peche 'n Brett,"OMG, I cannot believe I did not review this initially when I rated it! Yes, I loved this beer, the best peach ever and I am dying to get hold of some more.

Oude Geuze Vintage,"A bottle from 2007. Slightly orange tint. The smell is very sour, makes you expect a huge bite because of the age. Taste was more mellow, had a good hearty/sour taste but not a lot bite. Not very smooth, but that could be age. Amazing and a great experience.",0.657516184909342,4.5,0.9391
Chocolate Rain,"750ml bottle split a few ways  A: Very light for an imperial stout with minimal head. Not very good, but I guess it could be worse.  S: Tons of milk chocolate and vanilla sweetness with caramel and bourbon and tons of booze.  T: Very strong milk chocolate and vanilla again. Booze is a bit overpowering, but doesn't make the beer undrinkable. Bourbon is again strong, but a bit in the background. Very sweet and not very refined or complex.  M: Fairly thick mouthfeel with low carbonation. A bit too low on the carb.  O: This is a sweet boozy unrefined milk chocolate bomb. It's certainly not bad, but it's certainly not world class.",0.6621781537555489,3.0,0.939
Todd The Axe Man,"The beer looked like a prototypical IPA when poured. The body was pale amber in color, slightly hazy, and formed a one finger thick head. The aroma was very citric, evoking a delicious grapefruit. Deeper inhalation invoked some other fruits like guava and mango. The taste was bright and quit citric, reminding of grapefruit once again. The mouthfeel was medium and the alcohol non evident. Excellent.",0.6863450090134211,4.5,0.9389
Green,"4/21/17 canned on date poured into a Tree House snifter. I thought Julius was my favorite TH beer, but it is now second fiddle to Green. The aromatics and flavors of Green are so much brighter than Julius. I'm going to have to seek out more Galaxy hopped beers. Maybe I'm a Galaxy fanboy and didn't know it. The nose on this beer is so tropical and floral that I'm sure the unsuspecting would never guess they are smelling a beer. Green taste like a tropical mixed drink. I'm definitely going to seek out more of these. Team Green all the way.",0.5809490359234016,5.0,0.9389
Haze,"Lovely stuff. Orange and peach, a touch of passionfruit, a bit of a oily, herbal flavour. Pretty mild bitterness. Malt is very restrained. Creamy and smooth, alcohol very well hidden. Beautiful. A real pleasure to drink.",0.6845401208643931,4.5,0.9388
Thicket,"A- Pours a fairly dark purple in color, basically the color of crushed blackberries. The pour is rather effervescent and gives the beer a small and bubbly head about 1cm thick. Retention is very good for such a small head, and also laces decently. The body is dark enough that it can't be seen through, but when light strikes the beer, it is hazy .  S- Tart and sour acidity strike the nostrils first and sting just a little. The blackberries come right behind the sour acidity and add their own tart flavor. The berries add a jam like quality to the scent before the dry oak flavors move in on the nose towards the end. The oak is mostly dry and adds to the tartness.  T- Starts off with a big, sour bang on the tongue, The base beer provides the first dose of tart, with a puckering acidity, just like in the scent. Also just like the scent, the blackberries come next and serve up an additional dose of sour. Towards the middle of the drink the blackberries really jack up the juiciness and give a touch of balance to the tartness from the beginning of the drink. Right after the blackberries are there, they're gone and the tart base beer flavor returns, this time with a touch of dry oak flavor as well. Lingering sourness and acidity from both the base beer and the fruit are all that is left on the tongue once the drink is finished, and man is it a sour linger.  M- Like the rest of Cory's fruited sours, this one is a combination of light in body, heavy in carbonation, and rather slow drinkers due to the tartness of the beer. Nothing about the weight or feel of the beer makes this a slow drinker, it is just so sour that it hangs on the tongue and in the throat, making it feel heavier than it really is.  Overall, if you are a big sour fan, this is definitely for you. The blackberry portion of the flavor really shines through while still keeping the overall flavor tart. I prefer more balanced beers from Cory, but he does make a world class sours, and this beer is no different.",0.6739599567668486,4.5,0.9387
Beatification,"One of the best beers I've had, without a doubt. Amazing how many different fruit and other aromas/flavors come out of this beer from the combination of bacteria and yeasts, without actually having any fruit. Pretty much every aspect of it was fantastic, down to the perfect mouth feel. It's not often outside of a big stout/barleywine that I say to myself ""wow this beer has a great mouth feel!"" but it was there, all right.",0.6482527721301705,5.0,0.9387
Society & Solitude #4,"Society & Solitude #4 pours a thick, hazy and golden pear juice looking yellow with a big 2-finger, white and complex head, with excellent retention and lacing. The smell is juicy with a big, clean and bright citrus presence, like a tall glass of orange juice and tangerine with a hint of mango and a mild candied sweetness. The taste is excellent! Nice and smooth over the palette with a balanced citrus flavor with a mild creaminess but not overly thick. Juicy orange up front with some berry, a sweet candied melon and a grassy yet subtle dank characteristic.",0.7139930786916855,4.75,0.9387

Chocolate Rain,Somewhat hazy and very dark brown colour. Creamy tan head. Nice.  The aroma is intense. Bourbon. Chocolate. Alcohol. Fruit. Vanilla. Bloody crazy.  This is SWEET! Great chocolate flavour and nice oak character. The bourbon is here and there is lots of vanilla too. Really good and complex flavours.  Full bodied and quite oily. Moderate carbonation. Very good.  An excellent beer. Sure there is some big beer syndrome here but it is really nice and complex.,0.7043744209380528,4.5,0.9386
Sang Noir,"Bottle shared by pmoney. Served in a FFF teku.  A: Pours a dark ruby color with a light tan head forming on the pour. It recedes to at thin ring that leaves some soapy lace behind.  S: Tart cherries with some light hints of bourbon. Sharp vinegar aspect to it with a oak barrel as well. Medium sweetness from malts run across the nose.  T: Cherry pie filling with tart cherry skins. Lactic sourness with some zingy vinegar notes. Sweet barrel finish with a combination of oak, vanilla and light bourbon.  M: Medium to light bodied, alcohol is well hidden with a zingy finish.  O: Sort of like a black cherry warhead in a sense with a less intense sour pucker. Zingy and tart with some sweetness from the barrel. Nice beer.",0.6486830983855759,4.0,0.9386

Smell is definately a little brett, sour cheries, smells REALLy nice. Taste is REALLY nice tart cherries. Really one that takes the enamal off you teeth.  Mouthfeel is thin with a timy bit of carbonation but it seems thicker because its so sour. Really a great beer. I wish I could find this on the shelf all the time.",0.6015404568058103,4.5,0.9385
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into an enlarged snifter. This was bottled yesterday.  Appearance: Pours a light amber/yellowish gold and leaves a finger of white head that lingers for a bit before fading to a white layer atop the beer, with some bubbles. (4.75)  Smell: Big time orange/clementine with some lemon as well. Smells like the direct citrus fruit, rather than the ""flavor"". The hops truly dominate the aroma. Really nice. (4.75)  Taste: That big orange flavor upfront, with a bit of grassiness, spruce and a hint of grapefruit to round it out. Really drinkable flavor - the citrus/orange isn't too strong - just right. A hop bomb for sure, with everything else taking a back seat. Really pleasant. (4.75)  Mouth-feel: Medium carb with a medium body. Has a ""juicy"" feel to it, which works really well. Fantastic feel to it. (5)  Overall: This is a fantastic, tasty, drinkable IPA with big citrus (especially orange) flavors to it. A wonderful body and some grassy/bready hints in the background - I could drink a lot of this. I've had other beers with this level of orange/citrus, but this is better balanced than those.

Vicinity,"L: Cloudy and hazy light colored pineapple juice, little bubbly at first.  S: Very tropical, little bit a citrus, picked out the pineapple as a biggest sent  T: Still pick up on that tropical from the smell, pineapple hints of mango, with a nice bitterness to it. Not overly hoppy like a West Coast IPA, even though I really like those as well.  F: Very creamy, smooth, awesome mouthfeel. It leaves a feel on your pallet drawing you in for more, and craving the next sip.  Overall, I think this beer was very well done. I loved it form the first sniff at the crack of the can to the last sip. I want to thank @paresis for the trade on this! This was awesome!",0.6300044116513311,4.75,0.9384

A little lacing around the top of the glass.   Smell: A creamy rich milk chocolate with a touch of dark coffee and some caramel for sweetness.   Taste: A melted milk chocolate with caramel and brownie batter. Maybe a slight mocha finish and more of a coffee finish towards the middle of the glass.   Feel: Light carbonation with a milky chocolate finish. Difficult to describe with a slight sticky after taste and lingering milk chocolate.

Sang Noir,"On draft at the Cascade Barrel House in Portland. Almost everything at the Cascade Barrel House was tremendous, but this was the clear winner.

Coconut B-Bomb,"650ml silver wax bottle, served in a snifter glass. Dark cola brown body, one finger offwhite head, good retention. Fair bit of lacing. Smell is toasted coconut, a lot of bourbon, slight toffee and toasted malt, a bit of dark chocolate, oak and vanillin. Don't know if there are any additional holiday spices added, but the coconut and bourbon are front and center. It's fairly boozy on the palate, with a lot of bourbon throughout and a fair bit of sweet caramel, chocolate and oak. The toasted coconut presence is hard to miss, comes out more as it warms, but ultimately the bourbon roars back and covers it up some. Mouthfeel is medium fuller bodied, lower in carbonation but still appropriate for the style, which is a nice sipper in this cold weather. The coconut is reasonably well integrated but I think the cinnamon coffee combination is still king.",0.6669369363359123,4.5,0.9382

Black Tuesday,"The highest alcohol content beer you may ever drink, this 19% ABV imperial stout is a highly sought beverage in the OC. And just like the show The O.C., this beer is larger than life, populated by good-looking guys and pretty-looking women possessing too much money and too much time and probably prone to killing young teens who are way in over their head (I refer of course to Marissa, who dies in the show (spoiler alert!)). Aged in bourbon barrels, its rich flavor full of caramel, and vanilla, though quite decadent, is actually quite smooth as if to be enjoyed in a smaller tulip glass like a dessert rather than a thirst-quenching porch beer. Drink responsibly, perhaps with a designated backseat driver, and savor the incredibly rich profile while showing your backseat driver how much better your driving is right now, eyes truly awake. Try to detect the subtle wood, bourban, dirt, termite, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron, and magnesium molecules left behind from the barrels it's aged in.",0.62253476452849,4.5,0.9381
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"served at Ebenezer's during Belgian Beer Fest on Wednesday, September 25th, 2010. Finally extracting this from my phone.  Served in wine goblet (similar to the one with the cantillon logo) with moderate carbonation. Almost all of the bubbles disappear.  Smells entirely of raspberry. Almost all remnants of grain is overpowered by fruit. The taste is like eating a bunch of small, brightly colored raspberries; not the dark red sweet ones.  The mouthfeel is is solid and the carbination gives a spritzer like feeling.  This is very drinkable for the style. The tartness of the beer goes perfect with the fruit flavor.

Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"Look: dark brown with a .5 inch creamy khaki head, very minimum carbination   Smell: as it poured the room filled with an aroma of maple syrup, as you smell you get notes of chocolate and vanilla with a very well balanced bourbon   Taste: big maple syrup front fallowed quickly by malt, vanilla and a slight chocolate middle with a big bold bourbon finish.  Fell: medium body, no carbination, easily drank with a smooth velvet like mouth feel fallowed by a nice bourbon burn as it goes down, stupidly easy to drink for its abv.

Perfect balance of crispness, flavour, and visual appeal (that head, though!). Only critique for me is that the boozy nose is a bit misleading to how smooth and sweet the beer is.

Sour lemons, barnyard funk, white grapefruit peel. This definitely not as sour as I was expecting. While it's tart, it is much too drinkable.  Light carbonation in the glass but an explosion in the mouth.  Overall this is definitely worth the hype. This is a fantastic beer that blends the sourness with a touch nostril-pleasing floral goodness....and keeps it very drinkable.  Great job Vin. Hell, I even drank the sediment.",0.6525714230249999,5.0,0.9379
Space Trace," pour, fizzy, head fades super fast, no lacing, and pitch black. Strong aromas of bourbon, chocolate, and coconut.

Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,"L: Dark and thick mocha hues with an ample sandy head S: Nice barrel notes, graham cracker, chocolate syrup, and brownies T: Complex flavor profile led by the depth of the oatmeal stout with layers of fudge, dark chocolate, and a touch of vanilla F: Thick and viscous with a touch of carb O: I thoroughly enjoyed this one - a great collab by two standout breweries. I'm a bit puzzled by some of the reviews I've seen for this one, but a lot of it reeks of trader's remorse. In any event, I tried to taste the beer on its own merits and when viewed through that lens I felt it was a solid, thick, flavorful, bold, boozy, and enjoyable stout. For me, Appervation really earned its stripes.",0.6696801080213199,4.75,0.9378
Aaron,"This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a dark brown color with a thin layer of off white foamy head dissipated at a good pace. No lacing. The aroma had some sweet bourbon, vanilla, slight wood, lush plum sweetness, and a light tobacco quality (far underneath). The flavor yields to the blend of the sweetness of the previously mentioned aromas with way less tobacco (seems barely there). Sweet plum to bourbon aftertaste strolling into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fair sipping quality about it. Mild carbonation, surprisingly enough given the date, I thought there would have been a tad more, but this was exceptionally smooth with zero cloying. Overall, as much as I love Sucaba by Firestone Walker, as far as English barleywines this one just takes the cake.",0.7073445610628568,4.75,0.9378
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Bottled on 4/2010. Which is funny because I was at the brewery in 5/2010 and they had already sold out. Had to buy it back in the states (at about 5x the cost...).  App: The deepest rose I have ever seen in beer. Totaly clear. Nice white pink head. A thing of beauty.  SM: The slightest twinge of the DF funk, but very subdued. Same lactic tang washed over with a fruity jammy aroma.  Ta: Very lactic, more sour than I expect for a DF blend. The cherries are not as up front as I would have imagined. Dry, but not so much as a Cantillon Kriek. Missing that signature funk for the most part but it is lurking back there. Nice balance though, I was just expecting something a bit more complex.  DR: An excellent beer. I have to admit given the rarity and price tag this one didn't quite live up to my (unfair) standards. I think I would actually give this one more time in the future to allow some of the brett to play out a bit more. Also, I am not sure if the cherries just faded, but they didn't play as big a role as I was expecting.",0.6321373170621332,4.0,0.9377
Enjoy By IPA,"Poured from a bottle not even 2 weeks old all the way over here in Beaumont, TX. 4/20/16 version woo hoo! Pours a slightly hazy medium gold ale color with the tiniest bit of carbonation. Smell is piney resin drops of dank if that makes any sense, and the taste follows suit with a bold refreshing flavor that quickly opens up your pallet but hides the 9+% deviously well. For some reason it wasn't kept refrigerated by HEB. Great job Stone, concept is a very welcome one in this craft beer market where many a retailer overstocks, ruining beers in the process.",0.6188077669250825,4.75,0.9377
Coconut B-Bomb,"I made the mistake of trading away two bottles of Coco B-Bomb, and sharing a third with friends... and suddenly, the bottle supply had completely dried up and I had nothing left.  Coco B-Bomb is likely my favorite Fremont beer ever - it's rich with tobacco and leather, but coconut is very forward in the nose and taste. It's sweet and syrupy and incredibly wonderful. I've probably romanticized the memory of this beer a bit, but it's one that I will always chase.",0.5752241193242671,4.75,0.9376
Swish,"Can. Poured so damn hazily. Looked like peach juice. The aroma was fantastic! What a unique, expressive hop aroma. Puréed fruit-hops. I marveled at this strawberry and kiwi aroma that I kept getting. Not sure that I've came across a scent like that and I'm the town bike when it comes to hoppy beers. The flavor also brings forth that awesome, wacky strawberry and kiwi flavor. There is also a ton of peach, nectarine, pineapple and citrus fruits. It finishes with some drying, grainy malt. Not overly bitter. Creamy mouthfeel. Really one hell of a beer. I love Bissell beers but this one was easily the best. I'd put this up against any hoppy beer I have had in recent memory; maybe ever. There is no reason why an 8% beer should drink this easily and willingly.",0.6579748714310306,4.75,0.9376

Green,"This can is officially 3 months old today, so while the look and smell are pretty wonderful, the taste is underwhelming to say the least.  I'm not getting much too more than a strong Budweiser taste. It's actually sort of odd in comparison to the aromatic bouquet which carries sweet notes of honey and roses. It definitely has a full round feel to it. The carbonation carries large bubbles that melt-in-your-mouth not tiny ones that pop and fizzle. There is a sightly bitter aftertaste that lingers in the top of the mouth. You can tell that it was once a craft lager with a lot more to offer, but at the end of its life today. 4.75/4.5/3/4.25/4.25 ___ REVIEW 2 Now I am trying Green for the second time - this one is only a week in the can.  The color is the typical pleasant hazy orange juice color of most Tree House IPA's. Big foamy head that melts. Clean citrusy fruit juice smell and taste.  The bitter after taste is tempered by a full bodied juicy taste and feel. Even amount of carbonation. Good beer. (Mind you, I've already had another pint of 8% in the last hour) 3.25/3.75/4/4/3.75",0.6505635591764549,4.0,0.9376

Black Tuesday,"2015 Black Tuesday 19.9%  The nose is caramel, bourbon, roasted malts. The taste follows suit. Sweet, but not overpowering, great smoothness and balance for the ABV. There's a nuttiness in the background that I really enjoy. I love bourbon notes, and you get a ton of barrel characteristics.   This monster stout pours a dark brown, whiskey coating the glass nicely. Thinner feel, but full of flavor. Overall, this beer still stands up as world class. It changes the way you see stouts, and very few beers can do that.",0.6584687629935081,4.5,0.9373
Chocolate Rain,"Pouring a 2017 bottle from a 750 ml. bottle into a tulip glass. This beer, just like Black Tuesday, pours out way lighter in color than expected when pouring a stout of this nature. Medium-dark brown color with highlights all the way through. On the pour, as quick as bubbles could form they would pop. Eventually the carbonation got ahead of the disippation and formed a thinner light tan crown. The smell is quite demanding and confident with booze and alcohol. It burns the nostrils and honestly doesn't leave much else to show you along the way. The taste comes in more inviting, showing you smooth chocolate and vanilla, while still having a rather pronounced burn. I do enjoy the thickness of the body to these but I will say that I wish this and Black Tuesday were both more complex. They really aren't blowing me away. I get it, it's impressive they made a 20% stout blah blah blah, but I still want it to have complexity and blow me away. And these just haven't been.",0.6279285758321631,3.75,0.9372

Chocolate Rain,"Had the 2012 vintage the other night. A friend had opened it the night before and couldn't finish it, so he re-capped it.   Looks still and black as oil.  Smell is out of this world. Sweet chocolate, potent bourbon and a tannic barrel presence. Truly amazing.  Flavor was great, as well. I think being open all night helped burn off some of the alcohol and open it up into something truly decadent.   Mouthfeel was nice. There was just enough carbonation left to scrub the palate and keep the sweetness from being cloying.   Overall, I liked this beer a lot. Mocha Wednesday still edged it slightly, but it just goes to show how proper aging can vault a beer up in quality.",0.6679263593401497,4.75,0.9371

Smell is of citrus fruit, citrus zest, and some tropical fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with some malt flavors on the finish. There is a medium hop bitterness on the palate with each sip.

My favorite part is how resiny it is.  O: Sometimes one will have a craving for super hoppy IPA, and Hop Juju will satisfy. The only problem is the availability sucks.

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"750mL bottle poured into nonic - 2005 vintage  Pours a deep purple-red color with some copper hues. Thin pinkish head dissolves into a few wisps of film.   Explosive sour and fruity tones in the nose, jam packed with raspberries. Plenty of natural fruit tartness with oak and earth. Funky mustiness and lactic sourness with a touch of acidity.   Building sourness right up front, matched by a ton of raspberries. Earthy oak adds a nice base with plenty of yeasty funk. Musty and yeasty with some hints of red wine and red grapes. Building lactic sourness towards the finish, which is long, dry and lingering.   Medium body, decent carbonation, extremely dry and lingering on the tongue. This is a great example of how delicious and unique a Cantillon beer can be. I tried a small taste of a 2007 bottle right before this, and the sourness had definitely become amplified from the extra 2 years of age.",0.6809143202995541,4.5,0.9371

Aroma was so sour it tickled the nose hairs. deep horse funk, vinegar, sour fruits and a touch of lacto. really nice put together. As i take the first sip the ripe sour and rich apple vinegar dominate everything and leave no room for error subtle is not a word here as it shreds the palate. warming lets you find apricot and other light fruits buried in there and the age really starts to show as it really is just sublimely drinakble.  overall i can really tell why this is so highly praised, it deserves it. a fantastic beer!",0.6585451040757048,4.5,0.9366

Has mango, peach, light citrus, and a little pineapple. Also has a little creamy aroma. As noticeable to me is a bubble gum like sweetness.  T: Upfront is bitter, grapefuit pith. Mango comes through here as well. Even a little citrus sour notes as well. Malt is biscuity, somewhat like a cracker. Present on the finish and rounds out the flavor. F: Very smooth, and easy drinking. Definitely full bodied though it doesn't take away from drinkability. Crushable, though I'd rather save this. Bitterness is pretty high, not sharp but sustained.

Swish,"L: a peachy white  S: a muskiness that I don't get in the taste. Peaches.   T: flavors are amplified by an intense amount of micro carbonation. At first glance I get dark fruits, specifically plums. Peaches, but bitter peaches, almost close to the stone. A white grapefruit diet soda (akin to a more natural European drink, less like cloying artificial Fresca--still leagues away from authentic grapefruit). I get some grapefruit rind here on the finish, which is nice and refreshing and different. Highly acidic. Delicious, but not altogether integrated.   F: high levels of carb. Fizzles on the tongue like a Razzle Dazzle (TM). Somehow the body on this feels a little light in spite of excessive carbonation.   O: a delicious brew that called to mind many unique flavor descriptors. This isn't an easy drink however, contrary to many of the other crushable NE IPAs. This doesn't detract from the overall quality of the beer, and honestly is more of a refreshing plus for this brew.

Peche 'n Brett," bottle. Best before 12/2017. Served in a Russian River stemmed glass  Appearance: Hazy golden orange color with some visible carbonation streaming throughout. There was less than a finger of a white head that dissipated quickly leaving a collar around the edges of the glass.   Smell: As one might expect peaches are the first thing you get in the aroma. It's more of a sour peach candy aroma than it is fresh peach skin or flesh. In addition to the peaches, there's some bretty funk, lemon, pepper, citrus, and pear.  Taste: Peaches, apricot, some barnyard funk, lactic acid, white grape, slight breadiness, and a some peppery yeast. Sourness is low, and balanced by a mild bitterness in the finish.   Mouthfeel: Light bodied with medium levels of prickly carbonation. If it weren't printed on the label, I'd have never believed the ABV on this beer. It drinks more like 4% than 10%. This is hands down the most drinkable high ABV beer I've ever had.  Overall: This is an excellent beer and I'm glad I got the chance to try it. I still can't get over how drinkable this is. I had to stop myself from gulping it down too quickly. Definitely recommend seeking out a bottle or two.",0.6718980400258164,4.5,0.9359

S: Just a ton of wonderful funk hits the nose as soon as the cork is popped. Lots of barnyard, wet hay, and a bit of sweat. There is plenty of green apple and lemon to provide tartness as well.  T: The flavor is just so typical of Drie Fonteinen lambic. Lots of pungent and intense funk flavors followed by a sharp and crisp lactic acidity. A nice green apple tartness and some lemons in there as well.  M: The body is medium with plentiful but not overwhelming carbonation.  D: This is just another exceptional gueuze from Drie Fonteinen.

Swish,"Thanks go to Ovaltine for this one, as part of NBS BIF#5. 16oz can poured into 12oz flared goblet. Poured an opaque orange-yellow color with just a cap of white head that dissipated moderately and left no lace.  A huge blast of fruit came out of the can instantly upon opening, with aroma being of tropical fruits that I have a hard time identifying. Very similar on the tongue, with addition of a bit of hop bite to add some balance to the sweetness.  The body was thin, and the flavors didn't linger long on the palate. Drinkability was decent, the beer went down easily enough, and was soon gone. In general, I tend not to be a big fan of these American Orange Ales (NE ""style"" IPA), as I find the thick visuals, lack of body, and quickly disappearing flavors annoying. I realize the brewers probably feel like they accomplished what they set out to do, so the beer gets a higher score than I would have given on my own.

Can't detect much malt. Very pleasant although not overpowering aroma.  T - Yum. Plenty of the same fruits as in the aroma. The grassy/herbal hop bud flavor is quite forward and again; just lightly dank. There's some orange zest and pine bitterness but on the constrained side of an IPA of these IBUs. I appreciate the restraint. The finishes is very satisfying with the fruit, herbal and bitterness equally vying for attention. Really well balanced.

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Pours a viscous black, oily with coating properties from both malt and alcohol. A few bubbles around the rim of the glass are compact and stick around. Aromas waft up of dark malts, maple, dark fruit, oak, umami, bourbon, and mineral elements. Most of the overly sweet malt characters from Dark Lord are here replaced by thick oak with spirit notes and a bit saltier than the regular liquid dessert.   The flavor brings the same loads of dark malts to the tongue, in addition to being brownie batter a lot of oak pops up, minteral, even tealike and oxidized flavors pop up a bit. I could see how some people would prefer this to regular Dark Lord, as the oak changes a lot of the sweetness into an oaky more savory experience, though molasses and malt is still here. Body is full and viscous with a coating feeling on the palate and a palpable low-moderate carbonation to match.   Interesting twist on Dark Lord, not as sweet, but I think I prefer the sweeter malts to the oaky twist in this case. The flavor is intense, which is fine if the taste is perfection, but this isn't quite it.",0.695505167338354,4.0,0.9354

The flavors were poorly blended, with the general consensus among my group that the flavors were akin to cheap malt liquor with chocolate syrup added in. This also describes the mouthfeel, which was quite thick, almost silty, like chocolate milk made with Hershey's syrup.   I normally love a stout with deep chocolate flavors, but this just did not do it for me, and seemed more like a gimmick than a true attempt at crafting a quality product.   If nothing else, the name is cute.",0.6352034141224551,1.5,0.9353
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Brought a bottle back from my trip last year and finally decided the give it a go.  A - pours a hazy almost burnt orange with a full inch of fluffy off white head that recedes to an everlasting sheet with moderate lacing.  S - hay, lemon, apples, band-aids, and all the lovely smells that make a perfect gueuze.  T - the acidity has slacked off and made this perfectly balanced. a glass of funk with a touch of citric/lactic acid that doesn't fatigue the palate at all.  M/D - the carbonation and finish are spot on and have me going back for another sip before I can even sit the beer down. A standard that most gueuze should be held to.",0.6459281911490513,5.0,0.9353
Green,"Thanks Kegatron for the hookup. Pounder can into a tulip appears muddy like a melted orange creamsicle with a finger of white cap resting atop that fades leaving patchy lace.  Aroma is quite impressive with fruity citrus qualities that are a little tropical before getting herbal and almost minty.   Taste is not as bright and pungent with hop flavors as the aroma suggests but its still quite good. Citrus pith, rind and a little herbal.  Medium in body with modest carbonation. Pretty much a chuggable brew with fantastic hoppy depth to the nose and low-key bitterness.",0.6975620115552287,4.0,0.9353
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"I should start by saying that I am not a great fan of wheat beers. I find them a touch chalky and with an off putting fruity smell/taste. Obviously, that is characteristic of wheat beers, but not to my taste. L. From 500 ml bottle into tall glass. Impressive white head above a golden, slightly murky body. Dissipates reasonably quickly to lacing. S. That fruity, sweet slightly pungent smell that I find slightly unpleasant. Other touches of perhaps a little spice. T. Similar, the high carbonation adds a slightly astringent feel that dries out the sweetness on the finish. F. Almost bubbly, but quite smooth and drinkable with it. O. I don't doubt that this is a great example, but I enjoy the dunkel more as it pushes the fruity sweetness down under a darker grain taste.",0.6953739093867757,3.5,0.9353
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"(Notes from 2006 Dark Lord release day)  Served in a small opaque plastic cup.  Black with the smallest ruby-port hints with a small old-gold persistent head.  Smell: amazing. The anticipation from the smell is just beyond imagining--my mouth is watering. Dark dried fruit, coffee, caramel, cocoa, and some hops bitterness. Maybe some fennel and licorice?   Everything in the nose is in the taste plus a rich syrupy dark soy sauce like savoriness. Some bourbon- and vanilla extract- like alcohol, especially in the out breath. Some oak-y barrel and vine threaded through the deep rich flavors. Complex bitterness with hops, coffee, and unsweetened chocolate sharing the spotlight.   Thick, velvety, oily mouth feel, but not too tongue-coating--I don't feel the need for a tongue scraper after few minutes like some thicker beers leave me.  Here is where I will be controversial. I don't want a bunch of this. It is definitely in the plus 70 cocoa chocolates and port camp in that a small amount satisfies. I want it often, just not glasses of it.",0.646643400045604,3.0,0.9353

Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Canned 7/10/18. Enjoying in a glass, at home, courtesy of the in-laws.   Powerful citrus smell, a little like OJ at the tail end of its sell-by date. Very sweet entry, almost like citrus soda. Lingering carbonation. Great, long, slightly bitter finish.   Wasn’t too sure about this one on the nose, but the taste, feel and finish really brought it around. Another really good beer from Trillium!",0.6457669592587182,4.5,0.9352

Black Tuesday,"2013 vintage: Good lord this is a beast of a beer.  A- Not super impressive. Typical high ABV stout; little to no head. Basically pitch black, but not the darkest I've seen. S- GOOD GOD. The aroma on this thing is incredible. This was done side-by-side with BCBS, which smelled simple and boring compared to this thing (and I'm a BCBS fanboy). Sweet vanilla, charred oak, bourbon, licorice. Unbelievable.  T- I was worried that the taste wouldn't live up to the aroma, but there is no worries here. Wave after wave of dark fruits, chocolate, sweet vanilla, and bourbon. This is not a beer that will ""sneak up on you."" This beer lets you know its going to dominate you from the beginning. M- Typical high ABV stout. Pours thick, though nothing like TenFIDY. Low carbonation. Sticky as hell, but smooth. Foams well when swished in the mouth.  O- Need I say more? Best BBA Stout I've ever had hands down. This thing is a monster, so it may not be for everyone, but if you are looking for something to blow you away, this'll do it.",0.6285397701942952,5.0,0.935
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle at the Memphis Taproom while visiting Philadelphia earlier this year. Maybe I got a bum bottle or my tongue was off that night, but compared to 3F's Intense Red Kriek and Oude Kriek, which I love, I found this one overpoweringly and one-dimensionally tart, lacking the bright, distinct fruit character I was hoping for. Still a wonderful sour all things considered, but more assaultive and less complex than the other cherry 3Fs I've had.",0.6091818974408465,4.25,0.935
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,Honestly slightly underwhelmed with this. Good traditional Hef? Certainly. Best in the world? Probably not. Too much yeast and not enough clove/bubblegum for my tastes. I'd choose my local Hef champ (Live Oak) over this any day. Maybe its just that it isn't as good in a 6-pack?,0.5818191545518568,4.0,0.935
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Big thanks to foofaa for opening this 2007 bottle at Imminent Liquidation II for us to try. I have been wanting to try one of these for awhile now.  A - Pours slightly hazy copper orange with a fluffy one finger tall white head leaving small streaks of lace down the glass.  S - Smells of lots of horse blanket funk, damp earth, granny smith apples, lemon, basement must and a good amount of oak. While it possesses quite a bit of funk, it never gets too overpowering.  T - Starts off with a decent sour kick initially quickly being enveloped by the strong barnyard funk, musty earth, fruit and a touch of sweetness. Finish has plenty of oak tannins, combining with a little leftover funk, to leave the pallet dried but craving more.  M - Light body with tart, crisp feel and moderate carbonation. This one has very nice balance, as most drie fonteinen's do, and it was very easy to drink.  O - I have now had nearly all of the gueuze's from drie fonteinen and I can definitely see why people go crazy over them. They are crisp and flavorful while remaining easy to drink. Not my favorite of the bunch but no slouch either.",0.6636235587387226,4.5,0.9349

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2010 bottle. Thanks to DocJ007 for the share at our recent tasting.  A - Pours raspberry red with a nice one finger tall white head, dissipating down to a light film, leaving spotty trails of lace down part of the glass.  S - Smells of intense basement must and barnyard funk and not much else. Not a ton of fresh fruit which is a bit surprising with such a fresh bottle but it is still enjoyable.  T - Starts off with the strong must and funk combo that never really fades away. The raspberries come through a little more here but they are still more muted than I was expecting. Finish is still pretty musty with some lingering tartness. Not overly sour like some of the aged bottles I have had, but not as bright with the fruit either.  M - Medium-Light body with moderately high carbonation. The spritzy feel propels the musty, tart flavors across the palate.   O - My first time having this one fresh and it was interesting. I was expecting a lot more fruit than I got from it, mostly the trademark Cantillon musty funk combo but that is fine as well. Probably my least favorite of the three Lou Pepe's but still a beer worth seeking out.",0.6717633192817847,4.25,0.9349

A thin white head forms on top and quickly begins to leave trails of sticky lacings. The lacings become webbed as they cling to the side of the glass.  The nose is magnificent with whiffs of citrus fruits and a bouquet of fresh flowers.   My first sip unveils a sweet and syrupy biscuit backbone and then comes a full blown hop assault on my palate. Flavors of clementine orange, key lime, lemon and Ruby Red grapefruit. There is also black pepper bite and hop resin presence in there too.

Juicy (orange, mango, peach), also a hoppy/floral scent as well. It has a really nice scent. Taste is juice. I've never had a beer like it, that tastes so smooth and flavourful. It hides its ABV content and really just goes down easy. I do prefer beers with a more hoppy/floral bite to them, but to each their own. Really nice beer I'm happy to have.

Smooth aggressive tropical hops with balanced malt mix so well.. Crisp and well made this an easy drinking treat.",0.7435191216417063,4.5,0.9348
Swish,My first beer from Bissell Brothers. Poured from a 16 oz can (no date) into a tulip glass.  Appearance- Super hazy and looks more like a heavy fruit juice than a beer. About 1 finger of creamy thick white head and tons of lacing.   Smell- The strong fruit hits as soon as you pop the can. You really get the citrus and mango tones. No smell of malt or alcohol.   Taste - An interesting mix of fruits more pineapple and grapefruit there but the mango and other citrus blend nicely. Complex taste with no bitterness. Definitely would not have pegged this for a double IPA with 8% ABV.   Mouthfeel- Really heavy cream texture and kind of dry ending. Next to no carbonation.  Overall- A great NE style DIPA. I wish I had one more,0.6779934558376043,4.75,0.9348

T - Taste is initially bitter dark chocolate, followed nicely with the vanilla bourbon presence. Finish is very hot, almost pure bourbon. Delicious!  M - Very smooth at first, with the bourbon sting again coming through slightly in the finish.  O - Overall an exceptional beer! Glad I took the time to review it!",0.6346394810790048,5.0,0.9348
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"Poured into a Duvel tulip. No freshness date.  A- Pours a mostly opaque black color with a 1/4 inch tan head that doesn't retain long before becoming a thin ring around the edge of the glass and some sheer wisps of surface foam. Resilient lacing leaves a broken ring behind.  S- Very bourbon-forward aroma launches forth notes of molasses, dark chocolate and whiskey-soaked wood.  T- Holy mother. This is one of the most well-integrated flavor profiles I've come across in a BBA beer. Such lovely interplay between the maple and bourbon. Notes of vanilla and chocolate meld seamlessly with the bourbon and maple creating an incredibly smooth bourbon-laced porter.  M- Not very thick or creamy which is expected since it's a porter after all. Medium-low carbonation and a fullish body.  O- Extremely impressed by this. One of the best Jackie O's beers I've had thus far and I think it's safe to say this is now my favorite BBA porter ever.",0.6630172263198347,4.75,0.9348
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Had on tap @ DLD 2010! Huge thanks to BeerFMAndy for snagging a glass of this for me!  (A)- Pours thick & black as night. Produced a quickly dissipating brown head.  (S)- A rich dense molasses with a rather potent woody bourbon-like burn  (T)- Rich, with a big woody & bourbon-like sweetness with some dark cocoa & molasses. Very similar to the smell.  (M)- Dense, but thinner than the vanilla bean variation. Has a good carbonation level. A big, almost dry woodiness, yet has a bitterness too from the roasted malts.  (D)- A good stout. Not as successful as their vanilla bean variation in my opinion, but has its own special qualities the other ones do not. Unique and interesting on its own.

Society & Solitude #4,"8/17/2012  Huge thanks for the generosity. Much appreciated.   A: Hazy pale yellow with an inch of soapy white froth that lingers for a minute before settling to a thin layer of sea foam. Sheets of lacing coat the glass. Pretty hazy.  S: I'm immediately struck by pineapple, followed by nectarine, pine, papaya, and a floral-like spiciness with a dash of lemon. There's a light cracker and biscuit malt presence that's dominated by the grim and unyielding hop aromatics.  T: A juicy blend of nectarine, orange, stone fruit, and grapefruit rind with a light spiciness. There's a light crackery malt presence that's overwhelmed by a smooth upper moderate bitterness and a plethora of hop flavor. The finish is pleasantly clean and crisp without a hint of alcohol.

Todd The Axe Man,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy, medium golden amber with a one finger white head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, orange, lemon, grapefruit, light mixed tropical fruit. Flavor is caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, grapefruit, yuzu, orange, lemon, mild guava and pine needles. Medium bodied with light creaminess. Glad to finally try something from this legendary IPA brewery and it is quite nice. Aroma and initial taste are classic Mid to West Coast style, with an emphasis on citrus and pine. The hop herbal flavors reveal themselves over the taste, which is what I hope for in a big IPA. Great alpha oil finish with resinous pine and citrus rind. The malt thins out a little in the finish, but there is still a fine, lingering hop bitterness. I hope this stays in our market; with all the local breweries emphasizing hazies and bruts, I will take my classic IPA fix from any source and this is a promising one.",0.666610296965721,4.25,0.9343
Madagascar,"Imperial milk stout aged in bourbon barrels with vanilla beans The beer pours a dark black (not inky/oily) and has a razor thin head of tightly packed small tan bubbles that fades into nothing quickly. The nose has vanilla sweetness upfront, dessert like, with some chocolate and bourbon in the background, maybe some donuts too (?). It seems a little biting and spicy, but it's predominantly overpowered by the beer's lactose sweetness. The taste has a smooth, chocolatey sweetness upfront followed by a woody, caramel, and (slight) booze in the finish. The beer has a medium-heavy body, not as thick as expected, bold vanilla and lactose, with more subtle barrel characteristics, very little carbonation, masked booze, and is rounded and drinkable. This is a solid offering from 4 hands, reasonably priced, but disappointed with the limited production...would definitely drink again.",0.6797303771770389,4.25,0.9343

I enjoyed this side-by-side with Very Green and Very GGGreennn made a bold declaration. The mouthfeel alone is iconic. Just effortlessly juicy and soft with wave after wave of delicious and yet balanced tropical fruits. As ostentatious as this beer is in its excellence, it is deftly restrained.

It tastes pretty good too, there's lots of coffee, bourbon, vanilla, nuts, oak, chocolate, caramel, and a bit of coocnut flavors. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation. I thought this was a pretty good bourbon barrel aged coffee stout. I know I'd like to try this one again in the future. But then it is Jackie O's, so more often than not you know it's going to be really good! $11.99 a bottle.",0.6095941821291554,4.5,0.9342

Sort of archetypal DuPont saison profile adding those lemon overtones.   Feel: That delicate carbonation that's soft, but firmly establishes its presence.   Overall: Excellent American saison that pays homage to its Belgian roots. I say American because the sour, but it's got the DuPont profile in the middle that's quite evident.

Todd The Axe Man,"Bright, citrus, crisp. Damn if this beer doesn't hit everything I look for in an IPA. For my tastes, the new-breed hazy IPAs are too tropical/pungent and the old school west coast style lacks citrus to balance the bitterness. This beer doesn't just fall between those bookends, but it stands above most beers in either camp.   Not sure what it looks like since I've drank them all from the can. Aroma is citrus, pith, pine. Has a crispness to it that speaks to the zesty citrus within. Taste is orange, lime zest, grapefruit, pine, toasted malt. Tingly hop-bitterness zaps the palate and washes over it in a beautiful cascade. Crisp and snappy throughout. Carbonation reminds me of Focal Banger - really pushes the flavors forward with a lively rush. No alcohol heat whatsoever. Great beer.",0.6960843783130513,4.5,0.9338
Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,"Thanks to a local for swapping fluids with me & knocking a long, long time want off my list. 375ML classic Jackie O’s bottle while watching Merle die & celebrating another Twins win.   Inky black with no rise even given a hard pour. The nose is barrel & a sweetness that leans hard into molasses & chocolate. The unholy trinity.   Appervation could be presented as a Black Tuesday variation & I wouldn’t bat an eye. The mouthfeel is decadent AF, as the kids say, thicker than grandma’s fudge batter & almost as appealing. Bourbon booms out of the glass, along with most of the malts harvested in 2017. Sweet, dripping sweet, oak, maple, fudge, black silk, black licorice. No booziness present except when I stood up to go relieve myself. Bed is two flights of stairs away.   Not quite sure what the hype was about. Jackie O’s makes better BA stouts, but I understand that having Derivation in, or rumored to be in, its DNA brings out the hype beast. Still an excellent BA stout.",0.5914061239619602,4.5,0.9338
Black Tuesday,"This is a murky, dark brown beer with very little head after an aggressive pour. The head fades quickly and leaves no lacing. The aroma is amazing although I detect things that aren't in the beer. It smells like chocolate, vanilla, honey, cinnamon, bourbon, coffee, and fudge. The taste is sweet, chocolate, vanilla and honey notes with a nice bitterness that tastes like it is from dark chocolate. The booze is detectable in this monster beer but does not stand out and it does bring some het. Less than I would expect in a 19.9% beer. This is a truly amazing beer.",0.6038101900096345,4.75,0.9337
Society & Solitude #4,"Growler.  Appearance: Hazy yellow-gold. Head is bright-white, pillowy, and dense. Minimal retention. Leaves a couple chunks of cap with a small dense collar. Splotches and ropes of sticky lacing. Moderate carbonation on the pour.  Smell: Juicy tropical fruit explosion. Tons of peach and nectarine. Solid push of pine needle, grapefruit and orange zest and juice. Green onion and weed. So much peach it's actually a bit nuts. Juicy and macerated peach flesh. Sweet in good measure. Malt base offers a touch of a bready element with some pale malt sweetness. Resin. A touch of lemongrass thrown in the back. Incredibly dank under the sweetness.   Taste: Peach flavored weed. Super dank and super tropical. Peach flesh and juice in abundance. Oily and resinous pine. Pine needle. Touches of lemon and pineapple as well. Malts offer up a solid backbone with a slight biscuity sweetness with some bready elements. Pale malt. Some green onion. Bursts of grapefruit juice and zest. General citrus juice. A spicy and floral hop runs throughout. Tons of white nectarine as well. Fruity to the point where it's almost a candied sweetness. Lingering bitterness that almost hits aspirin.   Mouthfeel: Medium body with a moderate carbonation. Juicy and a touch creamy through the sip. Relatively high astringency with a decent dryness overall.  Overall: Double down every time.  These two hops always play well together and this is absolutely no exception. It's intense and almost overbearing but not quite. It might be the most peach forward thing I've had that didn't have peaches in it.",0.6839915342664461,4.25,0.9337
Second Fiddle,"Good DIBA. Loads of alcohol at 8.2%, but showing lots of fruit along with the typical peel and resin flavors. Nice fruit with a round, resinous, and clean finish. Definitely worth the try from Fiddlehead.",0.6534733525813988,4.25,0.9337

Flora - Blueberry,"A lovely, dark blueberry colour with hints of ruby shining through.  Mostly oak and sour farm house must on the nose, but with definite notes of blueberry and a tiny bit of wheat.

Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"650ml bottle poured into Sam Adams pint glass. 2014 release.  Pours nearly black with faint ruby highlights and 1.5 fingers of brown head that leaves a solid sheet of melting ice cream lace as it recedes.  Smells of dark fudge, toasted brown sugar, coffee grounds, dried dark fruit, maple syrup, vanilla, bourbon, and fireplace smoke.  Tastes of more rich fudge and strong coffee, candied dried cherry, plum and raisin, melted brown sugar, boozy bourbon barrel, charred wood, dried vanilla and faint bitter hops.  Feels big and strong. Full bodied with creamy carbonation. Finishes dry.  Verdict: Vigorously recommended. Aging this one was a good idea.",0.6167761834407349,4.5,0.9336

Todd The Axe Man,"16 oz can, canned 10/26/17. Pours super hazy yellow orange with a medium fluffy white head that retains well and laces the glass some.

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"750ml into a Cantillon tulip. 2008 bottle.  A: Pours a light ruby with a gigantic light pink head. This bottle is super-carbonated.  S: Beautiful assertive raspberry in the nose. Fragrant, sour, must, seed, rotted wood.  T: Lots of oak, sour raspberry skin, wet hay, lactic, very acidic, slight notes of vanilla and wheat. Very sour.  M: Light-bodied, frothy carbonation.  O: This isn't a fresh bottle, but it isn't exactly old either - I'm glad the fruit component is still bright. Plenty of funk in the nose, too. Awesome framboise.",0.6485557018081882,4.0,0.9335
Mastermind,"Pours a cloudy, golden color with a nice head and a few floaties. You can tell it's going to be juicy. The smell is strong, full of citrus, with a bit of dank as well. The dank comes through a bit more in the taste, but it's still mostly citrusy hops and it's strong! Its lack of bitterness is notable given how the amount on hops. Mouthfeel is great. It's a fantastic beer. I have to admit, I was a little shocked as I had never heard of this beer before. You don't try some new, unknown beer very often and get a real, world-class DIPA.",0.6292189019655385,5.0,0.9335
Nelson,"22 oz. best by June 18th, 2016.  A: really hazy. extremely pale. wouldn't mind a touch more clarity here. head is off white and frothy. decent lacing and retention.  S: green floral hops, soft tangerines, sticky hop oils.   T: honey sweetness and flavor. citrus, grapefruit, pine, hop resins. wheat like graininess behind. bitterness is low and not lingering by any means. hoppy, hoppy, hoppy.   M: a little extra body, but still drinks lighter than all hell. medium body I guess but could go light.  D: similar to most hoppy things from alpine this is super easy to drink will being very aromatic and hop flavored. the hop character is a little light for me as I prefer a more sticky resinous character, but still a well made beer. ive had Duet a couple times and find the rye adds a nice touch of complexity.",0.6847570216109042,4.25,0.9335
Sip Of Sunshine,"Good beer, but not what I expected. Pliny meets Heady.  Look is nearly crystal clear. Smell is lacking - Mostly citrus rind and pine, but nothing distinct vs. similar beers. Taste is quite sweet with flavors of wood and citrus. Medium-heavy body with a sticky start followed with a dry finish.   I probably wont be hunting this down again, but it was very enjoyable.",0.6921921066975697,4.5,0.9335

Sang Noir,"759 ml bottle into a tulip glass. 2014 edition, had 11/12/16, a few days after purchasing.  Pours a deep ruby, somewhat opaque, with a half inch head and some loose lacing. A thin ring of foam follows down the glass. The smell is sour, tart, cherries, some wine, some malt and yeast. light plums. The taste has a good amount of tartness, some sourness, cherries, malt, wine- more as it warms, oak, light bourbon, plums, purple grapes. Smooth, pretty full bodied for the style, well carbonated.  Great flavor, deep and layered. The cherries are prominent, there's a good amount of wine barrel, but not much bourbon barrel. Loved this, but was not as blown away as I expected. It has a really high price point, so, alas, this will probably be my only purchase. You should definitely try this one, though.",0.6573258918230687,4.25,0.9333
Chocolate Rain,"Appearance- The beer was a murky jet black color with a deep mocha colored head.   Smell - There is a ton of chocolate with ready barrel aging influence.   Taste - It seems like Hershey bar in liquid form. The bourbon lays perfectly balanced undertone. Vanilla and burnt sugar hints lay under the layers of chocolate. The beer is not overly sweet or cloying. It improves as it warms, and leaves traces of chocolate in the aftertaste.   Mouthfeel- The chocolate is so smooth with little carbonation.   Overall - Perfect.",0.681669103809808,5.0,0.9332
Sip Of Sunshine,"Weirdo thing to say - but sometimes there is almost this celery-like finish to crisp, hoppy, but balanced dipas. This kind of taste is best described as slightly sweet, slightly minty, slightly grassy, and all the way smooth. The body is what defines this beer though - leaves what could be a train wreck dancing across the palette. Well done, really unique beer. Don't rope this in with the others. Restraints is its best trait.",0.7318891759158208,4.25,0.9332

Haze,"Looks like a true hazy ipa, murky but still clean. the smell is a little fruity but you can definitely get the hops that come through that make it an IPA. I didn't like the taste at first, thought it was a little too plain but the more I drank it, the more it grew on me. True ipa with the hoppiness cut by the haze.",0.6127677236661362,4.5,0.9331

Black Tuesday,"750 ml bottle was poured into a snifter.   Appearance: A one finger mocha head was poured that reduced to a thin layer. It is a pitch black color with no vision of anything.   Smell: Vanilla, bourbon, milk chocolate, roasted coffee, and warm boozy alcohol.  Taste: Not sure what to think about this beer. It's awesome and I'm speechless. Some bitterness, lingering booze, and warm alcohol in there too.  Mouthfeel: Super smooth, creamy, silky, delicious, warm warm booze, and delicious.  Overall: Probably one of the best barrel aged Imperial Stouts that I've ever had. Not sure if I'll get my hands on another bottle or sip, but I hope I do.",0.6437158883043762,4.5,0.933
Chocolate Rain,A- very black with little to no head at all. Very viscous leaving noticeable lacing.  S- sweet roasty with definite vanilla and cocoa undertones.   T-very sweet. Not overly hot especially for the alcohol level. Mild vanilla with faint hint of cocoa in the very distant background.   M- thick almost like oil but very nice. Coats the inside of your mouth with the first sip  O- a solid beer especially for the high alcohol. Its worth trying for sure.,0.6595520006403179,4.0,0.9329
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"A bright red beer with a fast disappearing pink head. It didn't really leave anything on the sides.   The aroma is sweet with strong cherry, some of it a little too candy like, but it's okay.   The flavor is sour with some moderate cherry notes - a nice flavor, but nothing particularly great.  Highly drinkable, but a little too sweet without requisite complexity.  A decent kriek, but I've had better ones.",0.6904022551667415,3.5,0.9329
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"12.7 Fl Oz bottle Served in a snifter 2015  This beer pours black and is topped with less than an inch of mocha head that leaves very little lacing.  This beer is a year old so the coffee is faded but still present. The bourbon is faint and comes through with caramel and vanilla.   I get coffee right away with some caramel and vanilla. The bourbon is subtle. The flavors combine wonderfully.   Full, smooth mouthfeel  This is a fantastic beer even though some of the elements have faded due to me aging this beer for over a year.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Incredible. Really exceptional. Most certainly the best smelling beer I've ever had. My buddy kept the bottle and it still smells like we just opened it, months later.

Sip Of Sunshine,"Hands down one of the best IPA I have ever had. Smelled of bright citrus fruits of lime and grapefruit mixed with pineapple and pine. The taste followed the nose but the pine resin was a little more noticeable but not obnoxious. The fruit are up front and on display in this beer with a mild malt base, fantastic. This is a beer that I never tire of drinking when I visit family. It is worth seeking out.",0.6493254233362675,4.75,0.9327
Chocolate Rain,"2014 vintage acquired from Pdmoore (thanks)! A- pours a not quite, black with a mahogany shimmer in the light. Not much head and it fades off pretty quickly S- booze, caramel, chocolate, toffee, some dark fruit. Really nice T- Wow! Incredibly complex. You get some sweet acidity from fruits on the first part of the sip before the booze and toffee comes in followed by caramel and chocolate and more booze. Really sweet.  M- A bit pricklier than I would of thought. Rounds out into a medium, creamy feel. Not quite cloyingly sweet, but very close.  O- this beer was well worth the wait. Definite sipper and oh so tasty.",0.6534688583347791,4.5,0.9327
Oude Geuze Vintage,"2012 vintage poured into a snifter. Pours a deep orange body with a pretty frothy off white head that reduces fairly quickly to leave a small ring of lacing.   Aromas are potent and forward, apparent the second it's opened. Heavy funk and wood, ripe cheese, cedar, musty basement, citrus and orange zest, tangerine.   On the tongue it's super tart with lots of lemon and barnyard, hay, yeasty funk, citrus and orange rind, finishing crisp and dry, leaving a woody, oaky, barrel flavor on the tongue. Mouthfeel is easy, crisp, medium-light.   What can I say, this was one of the best Gueuze's I've ever tasted. I would drink this every day if I could.",0.6924996438148224,4.75,0.9325
Green,"this beer has been rated a thousand times by people with much better palettes and tastes than i. However, this is a great beer with a distinct color and flavor and worthy of most of this praise. I would not rate it as 100 as i feel its not a perfect beer. It is more subtle and quite a bit less fruity, and the taste is almost more natural and earthy.",0.6737158414399412,4.5,0.9325
Todd The Axe Man,"Poured from a one pint can. The beer pours a dark amber with a small head that quickly disappeared. The smell is huge citrus hops that knock you back.

Juicy,"Bottle shared by Ryan. Served in a Russian River tulip.  A - White foam settles to a thin cap, thick collar, and splotchy lacework. Murky, peach flesh-colored body.  S - An intriguing mixture of white wine, zesty ctirus hops, mildly tropical funkiness, light grass and herbs, sweet malts, and a hint of oak.  T - The taste loses some of the hop complexity, and fills out the palate with more vinous and sweet malty flavors, along with mild tropical brett flavors. Some of the earthy and herbal qualities persist, and there's again a light oak presence. Closer to a 4.25 here, do I dinged the drinkability a bit.  M - Medium body, appropriately juicy texture, and a soft but sufficient moderate carbonation level. No alcohol presence, and a lightly tannic and dry finish.  D - Another well-executed beer from Hill Farmstead. It didn't blow my mind, but the marriage of hops and yeast is finely wrought and the beer is eminently drinkable at 7.4%. I kind of liked things better when I didn't have to fight for 2oz of Shaun's beers at a tasting. Better than CD #3, and roughly on par with CD #1.",0.704911661445664,4.0,0.9323
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Bottle. Huge thanks to Hopscotch for sharing this bad mutha. Caramel and bourbon aromas. Joan Jett black pour with a brown head. Incredible mouthfeel and body.

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"I had the pleasure of having this on tap at the FFF brewpub on DLD, and immediately after having a DLVB, and this was better. A-Black, nuff said there. Out of the tap and ""rested"" there was no head or lacing to comment on.  S-Rich and complex with bourbon, roasted malts, oak and chocolate aromas with hints of vanilla and dark fruits. T-If someone made a mocha flavored bourbon, it would taste like this. Very, very nice and the flavors linger and remind you why this beer is so highly rated. M-Creamy, thick and low carbonation.  D-Excellent beer and one of my all time favorites. Well worth the wait and deserving of the hype.",0.65349606000965,5.0,0.9322
Green,"Serving: Can Canned on: Apr-6-2016   A: Pours a cloudy peach-colored orange that almost looks green-tinged if you hold it right with a couple fingers of solid, creamy, big-bubbled head that is always there and beautiful sheets of lacing; great retention. (4.5)  S: Big and pungent earthy hops with light juicy fruit. Orange creamsicle, dank hops, juniper, tart/crisp citrus, and a touch of biscuity malt in the background. (4.5)  T: The flavor is really layered with a wave of hearty, earthy resin that soon becomes light, tart citrus and juicy mango before dulling to a lingering, green hum of hop essence. (4.5)  M: Medium bodied with a slight creaminess and prickly light carbonation, extremely drinkable. (4.5)  O: Wow, this is a great IPA. A combination of everything that is great in the really juicy Treehouse beers masterfully mixed with the thing I kind of always felt was missing from said beers. Pretty juicy, really resinous. Tropical fruits and citrus are unmistakable, but the real star seems to be the sticky, oily hoppy bitterness that comes through in every part of the beer. Also one of the prettier Treehouse beers I've had.  Really good! (4.75)",0.7019097879371354,4.75,0.9321
Enjoy By IPA,"view: 10.31.17  My first review of this beer was when I first started drinking craft beers, so I thought I'd re review it for the new release.  Pours a slightly hazy honey gold with a white head. Smells of sweet citrus, hops, malt, some fruits, and herbs. Tastes of fresh hops, malt, grapefruit and orange zest, pine, and some other fruits. Medium resinous body with medium carbonation. Overall, wow, this beer is really incredible.

Madagascar,"Pours black with an eggshell thin layer of khaki fizz. Aroma is strong vanilla, with bourbon, char, and roasted and toasted malts. It smells like a vanilla Coca-Cola. Flavor profile is vanilla bean, milk chocolate, bourbon, char, and roasted and toasted malts. Bourbon is certainly present, but is balanced well enough to keep from being boozy. Really, the bourbon just adds a little extra character and depth in an otherwise thin flavor profile. All total, it tastes like Vanilla Coca-Cola, with emphasis on the vanilla. Mouth feel is thin, fizzy and harsh - it drinks like a soda pop, albeit a little smoother. Fortunate note here is that it thickens up just a bit as the beer warms, but it is still barely scraping ""medium-thin"". Overall, it's thin and harsh, which isn't good for any beer especially a stout. Vanilla notes are strong and refrain from coming across as artificial, which is a plus, but beyond that isn't much.   Served in a 12oz snifter from a 22oz bottle.",0.6601596268144393,4.0,0.9321

Taste is huge and complex, big burbon, alcohol warmth, dark chocolate, sweet grain. So deep and so complex it's amazing. Mouthfeel was considerably lighter than expected, sitting on a bottle for a year or 2 is recommended to thicken, sweeten, and blend the body and tastes.

F - Not as full as I'd like, but complements the beer well.  O - A real treat. Reminds me of Tree House's juiciness, but still retains its own character with flavorful hop bitterness.

Peche 'n Brett,"Tried from the cellar at Niche in Geneva. Had been trying to find a bottle for many years, and the hunt was worth it! First a warning, this beer is dangerous, it tastes so light and peachy, along with signature saison yeast character, that the 10 percent abv is undetectable! So smooth yet has a strong saison presence in the mouthfeel. Bit of an aftertaste of multivitamin with the peach but not in a bad way. Very balanced, would be the perfect beer for a sunny picnic in July.",0.6731293978719557,4.5,0.932
Chocolate Rain,"I have looked forward to trying this beer for some time and it sure didn't disappoint me. The smell is amazing, the chocolate is the first thing that hits your nose, followed by the bourbon.

I'm not sure how they hid the 19 percent, you will need help, because it is sweet.",0.585627704594572,4.5,0.932
Coolship Red,"Appearance: Well and truly red. Like Hawaiian Punch red. Lively carbonation pulls throughout. A flash of pale pink head bubbles, fizzes, and then disappears. No cap or collar. No lacing. Just effervescent red. Some deeper purple notes outside of direct light. Decidedly hazy.  Smell: Macerated raspberry layered with oak, straight up lacto, and some solid funk. Earthy in good measure with a big punch of oak barrel. Raspberry flesh, juice, and even some fruit tannins. Bracingly tart. Sharp acidity pushing almost to vinegar. Tons of fruit, even some hints of cherry skin and cranberry. Very mild hint of acetone as it warms, but you have to dig for it. Funky with some ripe fruit and then some. A bit damp and earthy.   Taste: Acidic and decidedly so. Lactic acid builds as it warms with some solid citric notes as well. Tons of juicy raspberry flesh. Oak is prevalent and becomes more so as the beer warms. Some backing raspberry sweetness to try and balance some of the hyper acidic and tart elements. Damp and musty earth. One of the most tart and acidic beers I've ever encountered. Pops of tart raspberry up front with a bit of a thin middle and then a ton of puckering tartness on the back. It lingers. A vague sort of yeast lingers in the back. A touch of acetone as it warms.  Mouthfeel: Mediumish body. Carbonation runs close to medium, but treads light. Bracingly try on the finish. Smooth at the same time.   Overall: Where I'll have my viking funeral.  It's Allagash and it's a coolship release. It's fruity and crazy sour. It's worth any and all drives to Maine. Seriously though.",0.6891337096366262,4.5,0.9319

Everything I want in a beer. Not overly roasted. Just perfect.  Full bodied. Good carbonation. Ends with maple syrup.  Amazing. That's all. Cannot believe it lives up to the hype. ———— 2018 not as good as the gold wax. Just not as much barrel as I want. Tastes like gloried MD.

Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"guest tap at Wolf's Ridge in Columbus  Pours jet black with a dark tan film for a head, dissipates to a rim.  Smells of caramel, licorice, fig and molasses.  Flavor is of molasses and fig, licorice, buttered toast malts, caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon.  Full body, chewey, with a tingling carbonation on the tongue and a slight boozy sting.

Taste is similar, orange dominates early, then becomes dank and finishes with a trace of hot alcohol. Mouthfeel is like crawling into a hop sleeping bag. A lot like Heady but has some interesting hop character of its own. The only real fault is a touch of hot alcohol - smooth that out and it would be damn near perfect. I want to taste this alongside Heady soon.  edit: with the latest batch I've tasted (late October 2014) the hot alcohol has been pretty much fixed; still a little hint as a teaser but I can't really call it a fault. Great beer!",0.6459687613796882,4.75,0.9318
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"2015 bottle, opened Nov 2015  A - Cola black body with a dark khaki head that pours a half finger high. OK retention and low lace.  S - Deep nose with molasses, Scotch, burnt bread, and a touch of soy sauce.  T - Rich, delicious and complex. Rich heavy cream, chocolate mousse, Scotch, maple sap, vanilla, amaretto, marzipan, caramel, tres leches cake, tiramisu, and cappuccino.  M - Silky smooth medium body.

Black Tuesday,"2016 bottle poured into a tulip  A: Pours black with a tan colored head, low carbonation, no lacing, no head retention, looks a little thin for such a big beer and light does come through when its held up.  A: Lots of bourbon, vanilla, charred oak, raisins, slight chocolate, and lots of alcohol coming through.   T: Bourbon, charred oak, oakiness, vanilla, dark chocolate, alcohol comes through very strong and lingers in the finish, aftertaste is more bourbon, vanilla, dry dark chocolate flavor.   M: Full bodied with low carbonation, driest imperial stout I've ever tasted.  O: I was expecting more from Black Tuesday, the alcohol is very noticeable and I think its too much as it really masks the other notes in the beer. Bourbon is not as noticeable on the taste like the aroma as the high ABV overwhelms it. If the alcohol was toned down and the beer's other notes were allowed to shine, this would be a lot better. Still enjoyable, a definite sipper. My recommendation is if you have a bottle, allow it to age for at least two years, then enjoy it. I had Chocolate rain with almost three years on it and it was more enjoyable than fresh Black Tuesday.",0.6428409678023401,4.0,0.9316

S: Huge pineapple, grapefruit, malt sweetness, tangerine, juicy fruit T: Pineapple, bitter grapefruit, light malt sweetness, hidden alcohol, orange peel M: Medium with light balanced carbonation O: Does an incredible job of conveying the good parts of a ""hazy"" double ipa (appearance, juicy, balanced bitterness, lightly creamy mouthfeel) while also having the best parts of a straightforward great ipa (malt, no yeast burn, hop driven). One of the best double IPAs I've had in a long time and I could drink multiple cans of this",0.7132550043095578,4.5,0.9316

Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Honestly, kinda shocked at the love here. Either that, or this brew travels super poorly. I think, though, that mostly this is a case of this particular hop profile (plus some travel issues) not working out for me. Heavily hazed dark orange body. I see folks post pics of stuff like this in bright daylight, and it does indeed look better, but under normal night time lighting, it's not especially attractive, just sorta muddy looking. As usual with Trillium brews, though, the head and lacing are top class. Nose is sort of generically fruity, neither the tropical fruit forwardness of their Citra/Nelson/Galaxy-oriented brews, nor more classic citrus/pine. It kinda made me think of Stone's Delicious IPA, which in turn makes me think this is a personal issue with El Dorado hops, as that beer didn't work a ton for me either. Is it sort of richly fruity (some places mention watermelon in El Dorado, and I guess I can see it maybe, though it's not particularly alluring), in the Trillium-style, all saturated and such? Kinda, although there's a distinctive malty note that, combined with the fruitiness and saturation, not to mention a sort of tangy yeasty note, makes this smell a bit like overripe fruit. Again, I think it pales in comparison to the clarity, pop, and depth of something like Pier. On the palate, it continues to struggle to get out of first gear, more overripe fruit, some decent bitterness. I don't know. I can't figure out if this is personal preference, Trillium brews having poor shelf stability (I drank this 23 days after bottling), or what. Clearly, I'm in the minority on this one. But, to my palate, this is the weakest Trillium offering I've had.",0.6752207377682469,3.75,0.9316

Smell: Strong smell of biscuit, banana and clove spiciness.  Taste: Wheat bread (obviously), some banana and spiciness, with a persistent biscuit-like taste. No bitterness present at all.  Feel: Lighter carbonation than many other wheat beers I've had, which is nice. Smooth in the mouth, with just the right amount of fizz.  Overall: A treat to drink. It's easy to see why this is one of the best wheat beers in the world. Refreshing and tasty, and it goes down easy.",0.6663414474799295,4.75,0.9313
Society & Solitude #4,"Growler into a snifter. Thanks go to Jonathan for picking up several growlers at the brewery and bringing them to my house to share. The brew pours a clouded golden yellow. A finger of off-white head fades leaving thick patches of lace sticking to the glass. A light swirl effortlessly brings a finger back to the surface.  The aroma of this brew has quite a bit of straw to dry grain or wheat quality. Citrus is there with some grass and cheese quality. When swirled it gets almost footy with a smell of floor malted pilsner and gets even more like funky feta. Faint tropical notes are there intermingled with some alcohol esters. The smell is somewhat like grapefruit but instead of the flesh, it concentrates more on the pulp or rindy elements. A cut above the other HF hoppy brews I got to try lately.  The taste brings the bitterness with an oily resinous cling. Just like the aroma led on, there is a very strong grassy and straw to wheat element. Some sulfur and cheese flavoring mid palate. The alcohol is fairly evident with a solvent kick that warms the back of the throat. At times this brew feels quite tannic and almost astringent. The bitterness is quite pulpy like grapefruit rinds and it persists long after each sip with an herbal to grassy feel to it. Some sips mildly hint towards some residual sweetness but that is short lived as the bitterness is quick to swallow that up.  This is a medium bodied brew with a modest snappy level of carbonation. For 8% it is astoundingly crisp and easy drinking. I just dont know what the deal is with these Hill Farmstead offerings. It is like every single one of them utilizes a strikingly similar grain bill with the same bittering/flavor hop additions. Other than the alcohol/body fluctuating and a minor twist and turn in the aroma, I am hard pressed to find distinguishing qualities among many of these. I hate to be ignorant or rude here but I almost feel like if you had one of their hoppy offerings, you had them all.",0.694996928673509,3.5,0.9313
Fort Point Pale Ale,"Dated 5/9/18 on the bottom of the can, 12 days since brewing.  Pours a nearly opaque straw-gold with a finger and a half of compact white head. Aromas bursting out of the can as soon as I cracked it open. First notes of the nose are of spices; pepper, coriander and cumin. This is followed by ruby grapefruit pith, black licorice, honeydew and a selection of over-ripened tropicals (mango, apricot, pineapple). Taste follows the nose with the over-ripened fruit and spices, but also brings in some dankness, pine resin and pale grainy malt. Body is a smooth medium- with low dryness and a medium- hoppy bitterness. Another great IPA from Trillium, perfectly balanced and smooth, Great blend of hops that give mix of pungent spices, tropical fruit and hoppiness.",0.6796475420906961,4.5,0.9313

Todd The Axe Man,"This beer has a fruity taste and smell, but it is not made with fruit. It is unfiltered. It tastes more like a Belgian beer. I have had it both in cans and in the brewery. The can beer really tastes the same as the tap. If there was one beer I would stock on my rocket it would be this one. For the amount of beer, the cans are a better buy than at the brewery. I have thought about breaking into the brewery at night wearing a wetsuit, and diving into a finished vat of this stuff, floating in an innertube and sipping it through a long straw until I got caught.

Enjoy By IPA,"This is the Enjoy By 7/4/19 IPA  Appearance: Pours a (somewhat clear actually) deep orange color with a mild, white head. Aroma: Strong aromas of peach, pineapple, grapefruit, mango. Sort of earthy with slight pine. Alcohol and Sharpie is definitely on the nose here.  Flavor: Taste follows the nose with strong pineapple, grapefruit, and peach on the front. Somewhat weak fruit flavors though. Some resinous sweetness in the middle. Followed by a heavy bitterness that lingers on the tongue. The bitterness is dank and piney and lingers. Strong alcohol and sharpie. Feel: Heavy and resiny body. Syrupy, sweet resin and bitterness on the end that both linger on the tongue. It's like pine syrup left on the tongue.   Overall: Not quite what I was expecting. Definitely a west-coast beer, as maybe I should have expecting. Attenuated fruit flavors, or maybe fruit is just what my palate expects these days with the haze craze. Strong bitterness that lingers. Body appropriate for the ABV. For a triple west-coast IPA, its a sipper/drinker. Good rating here, but not worthy of the BA Outstanding Score.",0.6729744941024605,3.75,0.9311

Swish,"Canned 01/15/16.  A- Tallboy into a wine glass with a moderately hazy pale yellow body. A frothy white head rises up to right around a finger high with decent retention. The puffy white ring remaining deposits spotty lacing.  S- The aroma is dominated by bright fruity hops but I get the overall sense that it does not really have the depth of hop aromatics as other comparable brews; just feels a bit short lived. Passionfruit (perhaps the most forward I've noticed in an IPA), tangerine, pineapple, mango, oranges and floral hops constitute the smell.  T- Again with the passionfruit. By far the standout flavor of this brew with tangerine, dank ass weed nuggets, oranges (juicy and bitter), mango, clementine, floral, pine, melon and grapefruit hop tones beneath it. The passionfruit zestiness cuts into the tropical aspect and seems to mitigate any nectar feel or juiciness for me. A hint of sweetness, pale cracked two row and yeast bread in the far reaches. Some swigs really are like pure weed, insane.  MF- Medium bodied with a creamy and even chewy texture. Carbonation on the high side with a highly zesty and crisp touch. Finishes with an oily dank bitterness attacking the palate.  For me the highlights of this beer are the passionfruit and resinous dank hops but honestly they might be... gasp... too strong. I feel like a few layers of great hop flavors get washed out and a passionfruit dominance leaves me wanting more of what is lost. A really good DIPA but feels a bit one-note at times.",0.695345952573791,4.0,0.931

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Had this on 2011-04-09 in Columbia, PA. 2007 Bottle.  A - Dark strawberry color, a little hazy with a 1-finger, pink chanpagne-like head that fades away fairly quickly.  S - Very rich raspberry, brett sour yeast, oak, light malt. Amazing, heady aroma.  T - Sour raspberry, lemon-cirtrus, milder oak than implied by the smell, a tad bit of malt sweetness that winks at thinking about trying to balance the tart sourness. This is a remarkable beer with wild yeast flavors that blow into the kettle through the open windows in the attic of the brewery. It tastes medieval if that's possible.   M - Light-medium body and medium carbonation. Effervescent, puckering and drying.  O - Top notch. I've been learning to appreciate sour beers like Consecration. This is even more sour but it is so good, there's no break-in period. I'm giving it an A, my wife would give it an A+ because it is right in her wheelhouse.",0.6634415333377766,4.5,0.9308

The taste has a bit more astringent of a hop flavor than I'd prefer, but other than that, this beer is 100% lights out.

Scaled Up,"Had this at the tap takeover at Rare Barrel as part of SFBW. Well ran.   Mostly yellow in color, the look isn't sexy, its muddled, clarity is nowhere to be found. Very thin 1/6"" white head. Aroma wasn't dropping the Nelson hop. Some citra/mosaic/galaxy, but the others didn't come across.  Wow, super light body, indicative of the wheat and pilsner barley. Alcohol isn't covered up as much as you'd hope, but its still bursting with hops and has a very soft exterior to it, the malt is super light and non traditional, and the hops aren't bittering hops, well the Columbus can be, but they aren't huge here it seems. Nice tropical fruit vibe throughout from the hops.   Very good but ugly beer.",0.6558340864923978,4.0,0.9296

Pours black with cinnamon tan head with some clarity underneath; decent cap retention; thick tan/brown ring and moderately heavy lacing; medium legs upon swirl. Sweet caramel, bourbon, roasty malt nose. Flavors is caramel, toffee, bourbon and oak; lite bitter roast malt; bittersweet dark chocolate; a tad dark cherries; semi sweet caramel/toasted toffee finish. Some dryness from the oak; medium full body but mor dry than viscous; moderate carbonation; tiny alcohol bite on tip of the tongue; slightly warming. World class RIS, roast malt, bourbon and barrel flavors balance well with right amount of sweet and dry to make for an enjoyable drinking.",0.6509185290325094,4.75,0.9295
Nelson,"Picked up a few dry cases at, wait for it...Total Wine..Huh? yep, Total had 4 cases on hand and I helped myself to all of them. Tested the 1st bottle slightly chilled, IMO, it's still Nelson, but a little dumbed down in the 12oz bottle. The Nelson that was produced in Alpine before the sale to Green Flash, had so much Nelson hop aroma in the head it would almost trigger a gag reflex, and was unmistakeable for any IPA's that that had Nelson in the recipe. Still overall it's Nelson, and consumed the next 2 bottles chilled and poured into a Riedel 32oz burgundy stem, the look was spot on as in the 1st bottle as was the mouth feel, the smell and taste was evident that they did not use enough Nelson hops. However, at $12.99 a 6pack I think it's tasting better. Lately it's been showing up on tap in LA and the OC, it's always better on tap but get it while you can, however you can. Hopefully New Zeland will cut loose enough Nelson hops for Beachwood BBQ to put Alpha Supreme back on the menu, we can only hope.",0.5462629637752828,4.5,0.9295
Black Tuesday,Smells like a bourbon bomb. Taste is obviously very very sweet due to the high ABV but still a fantastic barrel aged stout. Only knocks i have on it are the beer is a little thin in the mouthfeel and a touch too sweet.,0.6299079838140619,4.25,0.9293
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"It seems a classic beer not in the ratings but also in the taste.. Perhaps it is the most balance ""Hefe-Weissbier"" beer i have try but not the best for me..  First of all this beer it has a high rate carbonation and that make it little rough in your mouth but also more heavy.. That helps you to drink it slowly because some others ""Hefe- weissbier"" is more sweet and you drink them like your orange juicy in the morning.. Also is very spicy and remind me a lot the ""Paulaner- Hefe"".. Is little more lighter and balance this one from ""Paulaner"" but is very spicy and it stick very well with your food.. The colour and the aroma is the ordinary from one ""Hefe-weissbier"".. Orange with a lot of spicy and banana aroma.. Overall a decent and classic beer to drink with your food or to go out to listen some music in some place or some live show.. Is a beer that you can drink it with your friends outside and not you can drink it alone in your house i guess.. Little spicy and little bitter for my taste but i enjoy it despite i prefer more the ""Franziskaner hefe"" on that style..",0.6398540486090574,4.25,0.9289

Haze,"I think Haze has overtaken Julius as my favorite from the ""regular offerings"".  It just has everything. Look is like any other IPA from TH. The smell and taste is tropical fruits but has an explosion of pineapple and grapefruit half way through swallowing it. The slight dankness and bitterness at the end makes this beer so refreshing. Feel is easily my favorite from TH as it coats slightly better than the other 3 (Julius, Green, and Alter).   Overall, my favorite regular offering nowadays but Julius is a close second. A must trade for IMO.",0.6300081621288713,4.5,0.9288

Haze,"Smell: fresh squeezed orange juice, fresh peach, papaya, tangerine, mango, yellow grapefruit, Bubblegum. A little bit of a green note. No real malt presence. It smells like a fruit smoothie.  Taste: right upfront your smacked with fresh squeezed orange juice and juicy tangerine. Middle of the mouth tropical fruits come in to play peach flesh, mango, papaya a little bit of passionfruit.The flavors in the mid plate play with the creaminess of the beer to give it a fresh picked tropical fruit salad taste. The beer finishes with more of those citrus notes. Yellow grapefruit and orange. Some bubblegum, along with a light grassy earthy bitterness.   Feel: Medium body. Moderate to full creaminess. Super soft. The beer just glides across the plate.   Overall: Drinking this I can understand the treehouse hype. The hops in this beer are used to make a fruit bomb. the creaminess in the beer gives it a fruit smoothie like flavor in the mid plate. Almost no bitterness or malt presence. This is an A+ beer.

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"FLN 12 oz bottle (2018), fresh, poured into brandy snifter. Poured black, with the faintest of head, very little carbonation, good lacing. The bourbon smell takes front and center. The flavor is bourbon up front followed by some dry oak. The roasted malt of the stout follows at the end. This is not a sweet stout in any way, so it is faithful to the Expedition stout dryness. Right now, this beer feels like two distinct beers separated by a wall. There is the bourbon stout on one side and the Expedition stout on the other side. I would like it more if the two were able to meld together. The body is medium, again very little carbonation, not creamy, but not watery either. Overall, this is a flavorful and strong BBA stout, but it does not qualitatively separate itself from others.",0.6650898922905006,4.25,0.9285

S: Pretty intense aroma. Citrus rind, muskiness, soft cheese, overripe raspberry, clean lactic acidity, a bit of wheat and malt sweetness underneath.  T: Moderately strong acidity comes through first, followed by faint oak and mineral, lemon, subtle vanilla, some gamey hay. The taste is cleaner than the aroma.  M: Light-bodied, very light carbonation, soft feel.  O: Although this isn't the best geuze from Armand, it certainly has an intensity (especially in the aroma) that not many other blends can match. Very nice.",0.712583796127795,4.5,0.9281
Sang Noir,"Super complex--hard to know how to figure out this one. I've had this beer several times now, and I've always enjoyed, but it's been difficult wrapping my head around it.

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"A - Popped the cork and poured into a St. Bernie's chalice. Pours a rather pleasant, cheery red raspberry as opposed to the brooding clotted-blood appearance of the Lou Pepe Kriek. Short, fizzy head that quickly diminishes.   S - As soon as I popped the cork, the scent of natural raspberry filled the kitchen. This Lou Pepe does not seem to show a lot of wet wood and leather in the nose, it's just straight up fresh raspberry with a touch of perceived balsamic sour. Like the appearance, it is an exceedingly pleasant aroma that does not necessarily give away the onslaught of sour complexity that I KNOW is coming...  T - As is typical with a Lou Pepe, the first sip or two is shockingly tart. As the palate adjusts, the beer reveals layers of sour unripe raspberry, balsamic vinegar, and red-wine-like tannins. Surprisingly, not all that ""funky"" - the pedio/lacto certainly bring the sour, but I'm not getting any flavors typically associated with Brett....no leather, horse-blanket, sweaty armpit. It's actually kinda clean, with not much to distract from the prevailing super-sour raspberries and tannic barrel quality.   F - This seems to have a little more carbonation than the Lou Pepe Krieks I've tried. While not overcarbonated by any stretch of the imagination, I think I'd prefer this a little closer to flat, as to me it seems to intensify the already-intense sour.   D - It can be difficult to drink one of these alone, even though it's pretty weak ABV-wise, due to the intensity of the sour flavor. Aside from the low ABV, it kinda feels like I'm drinking a whole bottle of Merlot. While this is certainly a top-shelf lambic - and I rate accordingly - I think I prefer the Kriek.",0.6443808995973206,3.5,0.9277
Madagascar,Huge vanilla bean on the nose. Taste is as good as it gets....perfect blend of vanilla and bourbon. A true masterpiece by 4 hands. A little thin on both body and feel...but not enough to take away from this being a top tier stout.,0.6615685802312871,4.5,0.9274

Juicy,"lden to amber with a little head that forms a ring around the edge of the glass. S: Has that Norma smell, but with an IPA twist. Tropical fruit and some funk, nice. T: Fruity, some of the Hill funk. Lemon, pineapple, mango. Something almost like peach candy on the very back end with a punch of oak. M: Light, with nice carb. Very similar to the rest of HF saisons, but maybe a little softer, not real dryness as with some other the others, the oak dryness is there, but it's lessened by the juicy flavors. O: This beer is great. It's not the best one from Hill that I've had, but it's amazing. It's like a Tree House juice bomb with Hill funk. Solid brew",0.6350375750845059,4.5,0.9274

Enjoy By IPA,"04.20.17  This iteration of Stone's Enjoy By IPA is a crystal-clear, finely effervescent golden beer topped by a giant, off-white pebbly head; retention is good and lacing is excellent, consisting of thick, fine-grained bands and ladders. The nose is medium in intensity; it leads with biscuity malt, which is quickly overridden by a nice blend of grapefruit and cannabis with hints of perfume and tamarind. Alcohol overtones are deceptively slight. Up front, the palate is medium-bitter pineapple and nutty, caramelly malt; mid-palate, the biscuity malt foundation presaged by the nose shows itself prominently, and the hops expand to include grapefruit notes and a bit of grassiness. Perceived bitterness rolls back to moderate in the face of the malt onslaught, and alcohol undertones are considerable. The finish is a good hit of boozy, nutty caramel, and is modestly astringent; the linger is a surprisingly modest resinous pine bitterness that lasts for awhile. Mouthfeel is on point for the medium body, and is moderately astringent; the texture is slightly creamy and medium-peppery from the well-expressed carbonation.

Small notes of chocolate in the background. f: low-medium carbonation. creamy. medium body. o: Huge fan of Expo so quite fortunate to be able to try the BA version.

Aromas of pineapple, citrus, fresh-cut grass. Picking up a lot of honeydew melon.   Follows the nose. Honeydew melon and bubblegum underlying the entire sip. Tropical fruits dominate the start while the grassy and citrus (tart lemon flesh) notes dominate the finish.  Mouthfeel is typical of a Tree House IPA. Fuller-bodied and medium carbonation for the style. Soft. Slightly prickly finish.  Overall an excellent IPA, but a bit sweet for my taste.

Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Thanks to HighLowJack for sending this one! Reviewed from (long-standing) notes. Poured from a 16 oz. can into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass.  A: Pours a turbid orangish gold. Forms a half-finger of white head with good retention but fairly low visible carbonation.  S: Juicy citrus, mango, and tropical fruits - pineapple and guava especially. Lesser notes of dank and melon, light biscuit malts, and a mild wheat base with minimal (if any) grist character. This is juicy – like mango/papaya/orange juice. A really nice aroma; not humongous, but SO fruit-juicy.  T: Follows the nose. Tropical fruit cocktail, orange or tangelo juice. There's some melon, mild spicy, and dank flavors. Biscuit and wheat malts – again, it's a sweetness without husky or grainy character. Fruit juice and melon with a modest bitterness in the hang.  M: Medium body, low alcohol. Average to a bit low carbonation sensation.  O: This was very good. Unfortunately, I don't know (yet) what the base beer tastes like...but this is really tasty. Very juicy and natural, and a noticeable malt body but that doesn't add much sweetness at all. Excellent.",0.6801131448174359,4.25,0.9268
Flora,"Unsure of vintage. Poured into a HF bulb. Bright golden orange/yellow. Small head. Smells of oak and subtle funk. Some wine characteristics there as well. Flavor is so damn good. Some funk, tartness, white whine characteristics and oakiness. Amazing. Feel is spot on for the style. Lots of bubbles and very refreshing. Overall, a fantastic HF beer. Thanks George for sharing.",0.6543805897921421,4.5,0.9267
Sip Of Sunshine,"I can still remember my first pint before they turned over the brewing to Two Roads, and God it was perfect. I hate to be That Guy but I feel a little something has been lost, mostly in the aroma and mouthfeel categories. But let's face it: at $14.99 a 4-pack for such a complex, flavorful IPA, it's still head and shoulders above the grand majority of canned brews. Great mix of lupulin and biscuit crispness. IMO best served cold; I think it suffers a bit as it warms.",0.6476119998554881,4.5,0.9267
Chocolate Rain,"Review #238  This is a great beer. This beer is huge with a big bite from the high ABV throughout. There is intense chocolate that tastes like a bourbon dipped chocolate bar. There is some smoke from the grain but I feel like most (85%) of the flavor of this beer comes from the adjuncts (chocolate, vanilla, candi sugar) and a vast minority comes from the actual brewing process (grains, barrels, hops, yeast). While this beer is amazing, I don't taste beer.",0.6150420491102897,4.25,0.9267
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Jet black pour that shuts out the night, the dark tan head is so dense, it looks like a nitro. The first thing apparent on the nose is the barrel - it is big and it is boozy and it is bourbon. But there’s also char and dark chocolate and, dare I say, stone fruit?  The taste confirms - stone fruit, which tames the barrel a bit, and spruces up the char and dark chocolate quite nicely, and lends balance to the mouthfeel, which is creamy and just the slightest bit spritzy at the same time.  I’m glad I have a couple of bottles of this to age, because I think it will do so exceptionally well. As it is, this is world-class, IMHO.",0.64821751063575,4.5,0.9266
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"This one pours a very dark black color, with a small dark head, and not much lacing.  This smells like charred malt, spicy oak, smoke, leathery bourbon, and dark, dark chocolate.  Like fresh Expedition, this is brash and almost too much. It's still tasty though, with big boozy barrel character, toasted oak, bitter roasted/charred malt, smoke, dark chocolate, boozy bourbon, and coffee. This is one of the more intense barrel-aged stouts that I've had.  This is medium bodied, and pretty creamy, with a nice richness. It's imperative that you drink this slowly and let it warm up and open up, as more luscious flavors come to the forefront that way.  This could stand to age another 4-5 years. With some time, it will be a truly knockout stout. As of now, it's intense, but still good.",0.6662294925076413,4.25,0.9266
Nelson,The look is definitely on the lighter side for an ipa. Smell was amazing floral aroma. Taste was just about perfect for an ipa. Can not say enough about how much I enjoyed this beer. Can't wait to try there other ipas. Seek this out.,0.5966826236137317,4.75,0.926
Mastermind,"Aroma and Appearance: It pours a cloudy golden yellow colour with one finger of foam and some slow rising bubbles. The aroma is sweet dough, mild lemon, caramel and lychee with hints of biscuit and a floral overtones.  Flavour: Initially, there is a lot of biscuit malt and lemon drop candy up front. In the middle, sweet sticky biscuit dough takes over while blasts of passion fruit and orange peel overwhelm your entire palate. It eventually calms down into a tangerine and grapefruit citrus finish that has leafy lemons and pine resin on the aftertaste.  Overall Impression: This was an intense and delightful experience, the flavours are quite profound and tongue tingling.",0.672395616108515,4.0,0.926
Mastermind,"Can Date: purchased 10/15/16 Palate Contaminants: other beer  The look is gold with a fine head.  The smell is pungent orange and rye bread with caraway seeds. They're both distinct, but they don't mesh well.  The sharp bread taste is more subdued, but the citrus flavors hang around. They're not as sweet, but it's more lemon and orange rinds. And there's definitely pine. More earthiness, possibly tree bark of some sort, too. The whole melange of flavors are pretty good individually, but it just doesn't mesh. If it really went one way or the other, I'd grade it more favorably.  The carbonation isn't too prickly, and the aftertaste is mostly the orange rinds.",0.6781596264542424,4.0,0.926

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"A 12.7 fl. oz. bottle, 2016 vintage, poured into a snifter glass at Jackie O’s.   Look- a very dark brown that was almost black. A less than one finger head that disappeared quickly.   Smell- Chocolate, vanilla and bourbon up front. A little spice and cinnamon for extra aroma. I didn’t get any note tones.   Taste- Chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla on the front side and an intense pepper heat for an aftertaste. Very pleasant and next to no boozy flavor.   Mouthfeel- lots of carbonation. You could see the bubbles. Still a smooth finish.   Overall- A fantastic mix of sweetness and bourbon barrel with some heat. Definitely meant to sip and enjoy.",0.6319227560966539,4.5,0.9259
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Aroma is laden with bourbon. Caramel, vanilla create a sweet impression. Cinnamon becomes more pronounced as it warms, along with light pepper fruitiness and a touch of heat. Complex.   Flavor is fairly sweet throughout, chocolatey, with cinnamon hitting mid palate. Pepper heat is moderate and lingers in the finish. Roast malt is very well integrated. Cocoa, vanilla, and bourbon are in complementary proportion, with heat and cinnamon dominating. Would enjoy much more with less heat.",0.6874935353899249,4.5,0.9259
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"2018 release. Tasted from a brandy snifter.  Pours a very dark, opaque brownish-black. Not a lot of head, due to the relatively low carbonation, befitting the style.  Aroma is bourbon and chocolate. Taste is bourbon and rich fudge. It’s really, really damn good. Very easy to drink for 13.4% ABV. Not very hot, even though it’s very bourbon-y.  Decently thick. Not the heaviest bodied stout I’ve had, but that’s probably a good thing for this beer.   Bell’s does barrel-ageing as well as anybody and I was really looking forward to this beer. It did not disappoint.",0.6321540736605817,5.0,0.9258
Dragonsaddle,"Pours out a golden orange and more clear than most other Hoof Hearted IPAs.  The aroma explodes with tropical fruit notes. Mango, pineapple, peach, apricot, guava, orange peel, tangerine and grapefruit. Bit of pine, resin and slightly dank too. All hops!  Taste is much the same with big, juicy tropical and citrus fruit notes complimented by resin, pine and a nice underlying dankess too. Big hop flavor with only a hint of sweet bready malt.   Medium bodied and crisp with no detectable alcohol.  Not sure how they made a Triple IPA that's not too bitter, not too malty and this drinkable, but damn did they do it so well!! Best Triple IPA I've ever tried.",0.6666198957463682,4.75,0.9258

Haze,"Canned 12 days ago.   L — See: Name S — Orange, cream, chalky yeastiness, mango, guava, and, interestingly, a touch of spirulina/chlorella  T — Peach and orange dominate the palate. Reminds me more of Julius than Green, but has less of that orange creamsicle quality. Also getting pineapple, papaya, mango, and white bready malts F — Smooth, gently creamy, fluffy texture. Medium- mouthfeel, medium carb. Immensely smooth and drinkable for the ABV. Practically no bitterness, save for a slight tea-like quality between sip and finish. Semi-sweet O — Even though it doesn’t quite top the perfection that is Julius/Green, this is still my favorite DIPA to date. I simply cannot believe that this is 8.2% ABV. Drinking blind, I would guess 5.5%  94/100  EDIT(9/13/18): 2-week-old can. Reaffirming all above notes. It is so hard to not chug this. Straight peach juice",0.6626917238573249,4.75,0.9256

M 5/5 - Bubbles lead to dryness that keeps me coming back for more O 8/10 - Such a shame that it took me so long to get to this beer, an ancestor of what has become a genre: the tropical fruit IPA. If only pineapple sodas would taste like this (and have 5% ABV), I’d start drinking sodas again. For now, I’ll enjoy this Alpine. 43/50",0.6397399552076833,4.0,0.9256

So much sweetness in the best way.. Each sip has you swishing and exploring every layer of this beer. Absolutely perfect.   F: Same with the rest of this beer.. perfect. Mouthfeel is so creamy yet finishes dry so that all of the sweet aspects of this beer are done justice by a proper finish.

Nelson,"Cloudy yellow with a large foam head retaining a thick blanketing layer. It's not quite so much lacing as it is a wall o foam curtains clinging to all sides.  Very bright nectarine, lemon and even some fresh hop dankness on the nose, which I did not expect considering West Coast IPAs focus more on bitterness, and dankness isn't something I get in a lot of the beers from Cali. The flavors don't fall off from the aromas, and there's even a bit of Sweet Tart in there as well.  Since everyone has been down on Alpine since the Green Flash acquisition, this was a pleasant display of defiance to all that noise. I admit I'm not aware of what this tasted like before the transition, but it's tang and dry but juicy characteristics have me wondering if it really is all that different from the original recipe. Even if it is, this is a darn good, drinkable IPA.",0.6870176861700066,3.75,0.9247

The nose is a complex citrus/hop bomb. Taste is a wonderful balance between the citrus and the hops. Very intense flavor totally eclipses the booze.

A lot of wet hay, citrus and apples with a bit of spice too.  Really deep layer of funk in the flavor as well. Very musty, sweaty gym sock funk. Also some pear, light citrus with a subtle spice.  Excellent creamy mouthfeel with medium carbonation levels.  Obviously with 3F on the label, it's going to be good, but it's not one of the best in style I've ever had.

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"12 FL OZ bottle Served in a snifter Bottled 05/04/16  This beer pours black in color and had just a skim of dark cocoa colored head that leaves a little spotty lacing.  The base beer shines through in the aroma. I get dark chocolate and anise. The bourbon barrel adds caramel and vanilla.   As with the smell, the base beer is easily discernible. The anise is more subdued and the dark chocolate comes through more. The caramel from the bourbon melds with dark chocolate to give some dessert qualities along with the vanilla.  Full mouthfeel  The barrel treatment really enhanced a very good stout. I like the sweetness the bourbon adds to a stout that is not sweet.

It's something of a muted orange with a golden glow. The beer is uniformly cloudy. It almost looks like a mango smoothy. Can't wait to try it.  S - Totally blown away by the smell here. It's all of the citrus elements that one might describe in an IPA, wrapped up with that distinctive fresh smell.  T - Follows the nose dead on, but with a rounded, balancing bitterness that lifts the other flavors up on its shoulders. Truly a wonderful mix of flavors. No alcohol detectable.  M - Can't imagine better. A little fuller than medium bodied, but with carbonation that pushes the flavor everywhere in my mouth. It's pillowy, and not the least bit fizzy.

Fresh and acidic/preserved cherries and raspberries and ice cream come through. Alongside, dandelions, hay, Brett, and tart apple. Fruit is amazing compared to Rose de Gambrinus. I think this will be my first ever 5 for nose. Flavor has acidity and intensity of straight raspberry juice paired with funky lemon peel and a fresh herbal greenery that is hard to place. Almost like an intense mixed drink. Prickly crisp carbonation. Funky monkey this is a good beer, even compared to other Cantillon beers.

Haze,"Drank the day I brought it home from the brewery out of a TEKU. The line at the brewery was stupid long.  Look: As the name suggests, this beer has a full full haze, deep bright golden color and half a finger of fluffy white head.  Aroma: Classic TH! Big creamsicle aroma along tons of candied citrus, passionfruit and pineapple.   Taste: Aroma translates to the palate. A little more green on palate than the nose would suggest. Definitely a strong pithy bitterness as well balances the strong up front candied flavors. Finishes with a good amount of hop burn though, the only flaw in this beer.  Mouthfeel: Super crushable for 8.2%. the strong bitter hop burn slices through that thick treehouse creaminess.   Overall(style points): Another amazing IPA from Treehouse. Killer nose that's on par w/Julius but the strong bitter finish slots it behind Julius making this my second favorite beer from them. 99.25 points!",0.6736379015940153,5.0,0.9236

Overall - Tough to argue which is better, but bourbon always wins.",0.6154986267746334,4.75,0.9236
Chocolate Rain,"750 mL bottle poured into a taster. Batch 2. Reviewed from notes.  Appearance - Dark brown, not quite black. Ruby flecks in the light. Mocha head that's gone pretty quickly.  Smell - Chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, and oak. Nice, until the booze. Wow is it boozy.  Taste - Sugar. Sugar again. Bourbon. Chocolate, then sugar and sugar again. Alcohol rounds it out, I guess. I get the chocolate, but there's no other evidence of a stout in there. Still, it tastes pretty damn good.  Mouthfeel - Sugary sweet. Diabetes in a bottle. 3 or 4 oz. is the most I could drink of this. Excruciatingly boozy.  Overall - It's so over the top. Better than BT, but only because of the chocolate flavor. There's barely a stout back there behind the barrel and chocolate.",0.5989699746368666,4.0,0.9233
Swish,"Nice unfiltered look - color or grapefruit juice. BIG mango/guava/passion fruit nose that exploded out of the can. Tropical taste but finished with a bit of grapefruit and then a nice slight bitter hops bite. Significant carbonation makes for a significantly different mouth feel from Haze or Julius. Bottom line - this is a world class brew. Every New England IPA lover should grab a few. Personal taste, I prefer the Tree House mouth feel, but I definitely want to see this one on my beer fridge again.",0.6487866654953968,4.5,0.9231
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Pours a beautiful foggy yellow gold with a nice white head. Smells of bananas, cloves, yeast, and other spices. Tastes of banana, cloves, and wheat. Medium body with medium carbonation. This is an incredible hefeweizen, easily the best one out there.",0.6465208708068727,4.5,0.9231

Chocolate Rain,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Shared with my brewing friends. Served at 50*. 2013 vintage. I am reviewing this as a representation of a barrel aged stout and nothing more.  A- Pours a deep brown/black. Minimal head that disappears quickly. No light is passing through. Viscous liquid, and due to the high alcohol, it leaves legs on the glass. Not what I usually look for in a barrel aged stout.   S- BOOZE and CHOCOLATE. This thing is a mess. Upfront, I get a lot of sweet sweet sweet bourbon, vanilla, and chocolate. Aromas of toasted coconut and burnt sugar follow right behind. The aroma gave me diabeetus. So far, I don't understand why people are crazy about this. It smells like a Hershey's chocolate bar (cheap chocolate) mixed with Wild Turkey 101 bourbon.  T- Guh.... Cloyingly sweet. More of a mess than I was even expecting. It was boozy, hot, chocolaty, and very sweet. I may have grabbed a bottle of Hershey's syrup instead of chocolate rain. The alcohol is not masked at all. It seemed quite amateur. It doesn't taste like it was expertly crafted.  M- The lack of any real carbonation just made this sit in my mouth. It coated me teeth and gave me cavities.  O- Ok, The Bruery. I understand you guys like your big bottles and fancy wax, but please make the beer taste better. This whole badass, high alcohol, wax dipping thing appeals to high school lacrosse players, but the beer inside doesn't deliver a level of sophistication that I expect from a $40 bottle of beer. This was a total mess and a huge disappointment. I really don't understand the hype.",0.6155325631761921,2.25,0.9231
Mastermind,"12oz can. Pours a hazy medium yellow gold, with a small white head. Has a very piney citrus grapefruit aroma. Taste is similar with a nice citrus grapefruit tangy hops flavor, mild biscuit malt with some caramel notes as well. A medium body on the palate, good carbonation. Finish is sweet citrus, pine and grapefruit tanginess, with mild malt and caramel notes, slight dry finish. A good tasty solid all around brew.",0.6812764466941073,3.75,0.9231
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2010 sticker. Beautiful deep ruby red, even under artificial light at night. Smells of sweet (and surprisingly fresh) raspberries and unmistakable Cantillon funk and the taste follows exactly.

Scaled Up,"Bright, tropical gold appearance with a creamy, thick toothpaste head.  Aromas of fresh oranges, grapefruit, mango, and honey.   Flavors are juicy, with a mild resinous bitterness ghosting in the background. Flavors of bright mango, grapefruits, oranges, honey biscuit, and finish of pine.  Feel is creamy, firm, tight. Nice resinous drag on the finish.  Overall, a great, fruity IPA with lots of tight and bright notes.",0.684576396229067,4.25,0.9231

Oude Geuze Vintage,"2006 bottle (same as Cam below - thanks for sharing Cam!)  Pours a very hazy light orange color with a whitish head. The nose is really funky - get that diaper flavor. It smells really good.  The taste is dry, funky and earthy and way more so than it is sour. Light on the palette and goes down quite easy. Not all that tart or vinegary. Really tame for a guezue. Overall, I thought this was a very accessible idea of a guezue and I enjoyed it very much.",0.6580996459709384,4.5,0.923
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),This beer poured a dark black color into my snifter glass with almost no head. Lots of great bourbon in the nose with hints of some sweetness. The taste is actually fairly mellow not over blown with bourbon. The mouth feel is smooth and has a nice viscosity. Another great variant from 50/50.,0.6503868087993854,4.5,0.923
Double Orange Starfish,"Can stamped 07/05/17  Cloudy, milky orange color with a small, densely creamy head. Zesty, fresh hoppy aromatics fill the nose: orange juice, mango, melon, peach, light grassy herbs, and white bread. Bold juicy fruity flavor...tangerine, mango puree, pineapple, passion fruit, apricot, and green hop oils. Not too heavy on the fruity sweetness and properly dry for a DIPA keeping it drinkable. Smooth and juicy. Very good.",0.6654722116586879,4.5,0.923
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"I've been a pilsner guy my whole life. I never liked the taste of wheatbeer, it lacked that 'bite' I enjoy out of pilsners. The critical acclaim of this beer made me give it a try and I have to say - wow. I'm not gonna go into detail but the taste is phenomenal, it's got all those qualities that I enjoy in pilsners but also the smoothness of a wheatbeer, I also love that sour aftertaste. It might just be my new goto brand.",0.6288454528519734,4.75,0.9229

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"2016 batch L: Pours an insanely thick dark mocha and chocolate syrup hue with a minimal rusty head S: Upon cracking the cap an intense Grade B maple syrup aroma filled my nostrils. The maple is complemented by roasted coffee and Nestle Toll House chocolate chips T: Insane. A complete breakfast in a glass - a hearty full stack of chocolate chip pancakes drowning in Fancy grade syrup and a full pint of Grade B. Molasses, caramel, and butterscotch round out the middle. Finally, a slightly bitter black cup of java on the finish - very complex F: Thick, rich and syrupy. O: I realize that KBBS needed another review like I need a hole in my head, but man, given the effort to track this one down I felt compelled to at least write some notes - maybe I'll share this review with my grand kids someday. This beer is effortlessly rich and complex. The barrel aging is subtle and lets the stout stand on its own two feet. All around this is incredible and one I feel fortune to have tried.",0.6426175342259198,5.0,0.9226
Black Tuesday,"2014 bottle opened in 2016.  This is my first time having Black Tuesday, so I cannot compare it fresh. However, I've had lots of So Happens It's Tuesday, and honestly it is very similar; almost indistinguishable.  The nose is filled with wonderful aromas. The standouts are caramel, vanilla, bourbon and raisin. It is still quite hot and it hit me immediately even after a sizable dinner. Halfway through my first pour, the burn is present pretty much everywhere.   It is very sweet, and the booze still dominates a lot of the other flavors. I wish the taste contained more of what I get from the nose, but I think it needs several more years before the booze cools off and the other flavors shine through.  Overall, between So Happens Its Tuesday and 2 year old Black Tuesday, I'm going with So Happens. However, I think with 5+ years, this thing will be amazing.",0.5777520520928495,4.5,0.9226
Peche 'n Brett,"Pours hazy orange in color. Smell is big peach with a hint of funk. Funk is more present in the flavor. Not much residual sweetness but not overly dry. Alcohol VERY well hidden. Light bodied in spite of strength. Funky peach juice. More funk would be great, but very nice drinking beer that tells you exactly what it is.",0.6584952877392845,4.25,0.9226
Oude Geuze Vintage,"This beer will have you cursing in foreign tongues trying to figure out what it was that you actually just put into your mouth. Some Etheopian slang words are entering my head now just thinking about it. Ok, this is gueuze. There's no getting around it, you are either masochitistly into this, or you try to avoid it like the vile stench of the night that it is. I'm a masochist, let's dive in. This pours like a fine sparkling wine, with a fresca like effervescence. Are you allowed to compare beer to Fresca here? YOU CAN'T STOP ME! There's all sorts of crazyness going on in the nose. Sour, spicy, even bitter notes float up, like cherries and tar, but in a good way.Suck on a lemon, stick some tobacco up our nose, and cover your head with a musty old gym bag. Congrats, you just saved $10. The body is equally complex, but strangely different from the nose. Here you'll find lots of grapefruit and sour apple, cherries, and some used bandaids. It goes down slick, almost oily, but still bubbly and light, with a clean refreshing finish. The sourness lingers longest on the palate, but every sip was a mystery, building on the last. So far, this is now my favorite way to punish myself with a gueuze.",0.6119763210261014,4.0,0.9225

T: Huge vanilla with subtle bourbon notes. Delicious beer.  M: Super smooth. Very drinkable. Med mouthfeel with med carbonation.  O: Finally, a beer that lives up to the amount of vanilla I want!

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Served in a pint glass. Beer pours a rich golden straw color. Very cloudy, large foamy white head with great retention and lacing. This is about as attractive as a beer can get.  Banana, cloves, yeast. It smells exactly what you’d expect from a Hefeweizen.  Taste follows nose exactly as anticipated. Strong banana on the front end with excellent balancing of clove and spice to keep it just in check.  Sweet and refreshing. Light bodied, medium carbonation. Very sessionable.  This beer is incredible. It’s available on tap all over in my area, if you can get it try it! But even out of the bottle it’s right there. For the style, this for me is at the very top.",0.6878394440914087,4.5,0.9221

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"2011 vintage served on draft at 2013 dark lord day.  A - Jet black just like the standard dark lord. Thin brown lacing after a faint cocoa head.  S - Bourbon up front of course with lots of dark fruit, figs, milk chocolate, caramel, sugar  T - What you smell is what you get. An intense whiskey bomb that is very mellow. Lots of chocolate and dark fruit but not as pronounced as in the regular version. Less sweet and more woody for lack of better words. The barrel character really shines through and highlights the base beer.   M - No carbonation really but that is to be expected. Almost a little too sweet to the point where it hurts to drink. Alcohol is there but it goes down smooth enough that you can't feel it right away.  O - Absoulteley delicious and more well rounded than most bourbon barrel stouts. I am not sure if the bottle cost is worth it but this is a nice beer and that is what counts.",0.6288458549856573,4.75,0.922
Haze,"16oz can, acquired from the brewery.  As expected this beer is pretty damn hazy though the light does come through so all is not lost. Perhaps one of the best heads I've seen on a beer. Smells of mango, apricots, ruby red grapefruit, and kiwi ... pithy and rind-like with lots of juice. Super juicy, juice box juicy. Very smooth with some body. A kiss of malt, hops are obviously dominant here. Slight bitterness but it is soft. A bit pungent within all of this juicy character. Love what they did with this brew, keep it going guys!!",0.6476603903123814,4.25,0.9219
Nelson,"Picked this up from BDBS in SD.  L: Pale yellow with some good carbonation and about a finger head. Leaves a bit of lacing on the glass as you sip.  S: Lots of citrus, orange rind, lemon, floral notes, pine, sugar, and I'm even picking up something that reminds me of banana.  T: A really clean IPA flavor with a nice balance of hop bitterness and malt sweetness.  F: Medium to light body; suits a 7% ABV well.  Really like Nelson. Hopefully with the Green Flash takeover they can still produce the same quality that Alpine has been known for.",0.6597007693703695,4.25,0.9219

Haze,"Like other TH pale ales, this one isn't much to look at. Where it shines is the hop finish that is lacking in some of the brewery's other popular offerings. The citrus aroma isn't nearly as overpowering as it is in Julius, Green, or Alter Ego. The taste has a better malt/hops balance. The mouthfeel and body are right on par with the best TH has to offer. A fine example of the NE-style pale ale.",0.6748391739884818,4.5,0.9217

Awesome beer, this has actually turned me on to sours.",0.6034567417752797,4.5,0.9217

Aaron,"Poured out as a deep brown color with a very small ring of head on top. The smell is loaded with heavy malt aromas and subtle Barrel in there too. The taste is rich, plethora of malt flavors in there with hints of bourbon. The mouthfeel is smooth, but it's got a heavy body to it which is perfect for the style.

Green,"Poured into a 13 oz Tired Hands Teku glass canned on 3/08/18. Pours like a glass of pineapple orange juice with a massive 2 plus finger sticky white head that leaves a thin wall of lace behind as it slowly settles into a thin layer of bubbles.  Smell pineapple, tangerine, passionfruit, a little dank, and ripe grapefruit.  Taste follows tropical front to back fresh squeezed pineapple oj, passionfruit, sticky buds, and grapefruit balanced with just a little bitterness.  Mouthfeel is a big medium, enough life but slightly soft as it should be, actually a tad dry from all the fresh hops, and it is very approachable but more flavor than most 7.5% ABV beers.  Overall this is awesome as you would expect from one of the hottest breweries going. You can’t have a Treehouse without expecting a ton and this one delivered the goods, thanks THEIPAHunter for this one.",0.661145271496455,4.5,0.9216

The head is completely solid, no bubbles getting through, perfect layer of lacing...gorgeous  S- slight aroma of lemons, with a nice bit of funk in there too. Good, but not overly fragrant  T- intensely sour. As in, I take a sip and I can feel it in my ears. Tons of citrus...grapefruit, lemon, and all-out funk.  M- the body on this sour is actually thicker than I have ever seen in a wild/lambic style. Carbonation level is good  O- this is one of the absolute best beers I've ever had, and completely worth the price tag and cost from shipping from Cali.

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Bottle 134/420? from '12 in to a Goose Island Glass  A- Dark brown. Lacing is sticky. When I bob the glass left and right, the lacing sticks. Good retention.   S- Bourbon, dark fruit/fig, molasses, light woody oak hint in the back. I am getting soy sauce in this too. ha  T- This has more of the base beer character than the vanilla. Very sweet, almost comes off as rum because of the sweet base beer. I know that people say that the ba DL's shed their sweet DL characteristics. I am not getting that much here. I enjoyed vanilla a lot more. I am getting a lot of that sweet soy characteristic.   M- This is the shining part of this beer for me. Not the category that I want my Bourbon DL to shine, but it is what it is. Nice and chewy. Viscous  O- I was a bit disappointed with this variant.

Green,"Canned 2 weeks ago and tried alongside a can of 2-week-old Julius and 1-week-old DDH Congress St.  L -- Milky, murky orange haze with a good-sized dense white head produced with moderately aerated pour. Excellent retention and lacing S -- Very dank, resinous, rubbery, and grassy upfront, but mellowed out by the cornmeal-smelling malts and mango purée aroma produced by the Galaxy hops. A little kale and spinach as well. Not as much of a pop as the aromas on DDH Congress T -- White bready malts, orange purée, white peach, garlicy spiciness, and yeast. More bitter than Julius, but not by much. DDH Congress has a more aggressive fruitiness, but the yeast and malt character is also more assertive F -- Classic TH: smooth, creamy, soft. Moderate carbonation. When one tries a TH brew, they know they will at least get an unbelievable roundedness to the mouthfeel, and this is no exception.  O -- Green is definitely more dank and heady than Julius, which gives it more assertiveness upfront. The flavors and mouthfeel, however, are a little obscured by the slightly heavier alcohol presence and hop character. At only $3.80/can from the brewery, this is *very* worth the price   96/100  EDIT (3/24/18):   1-day-old can. Aligns almost exactly with my prior notes, although the aromas may be even slightly more pungent thanks to the freshness of the can.  EDIT (3/26/18):  3-day-old can alongside a 4-day-old can of Very Green. Drinking side by side made me realize how Green is just as great despite being way more commonly available from the brewery, with a case limit PP instead of 2 cans PP. Having alongside Very Green did make me realize that the appearance is not quite perfect: the retention and lacing could be improved upon, as its big brother evidenced.   95/100",0.6942915976706754,4.75,0.9212
Nelson,"I had this on draft at a local (excellent) bar. The rye flavor was pretty good, but not outstanding. Ideally, a rye IPA is an excellent IPA with a just more kick. This tasted like a pretty good IPA with some rye.",0.6358551466513945,4.0,0.9212
Enjoy By IPA,"4 oz pour, small tulip, Best By 10/31/17.   Clear golden rod with a small off white head.   Full and juicy nose with tangerine, kiwi, yuzu.   Orange and tangerine, juicy, resinous, and closes out with medium bitterness. It's on the dry side and the alcohol is well hidden.   Drying with soft carbonation.   It isn't as intensely hoppy as promised. It's a good double IPA that avoids being sweet or boozy.",0.6598154602839492,3.75,0.9211
Haze,"This beer pours an opaque cloudy burnt orange with a golden hue when held up to the light. The head is dense, 2 fingers and bright white. Retention is excellent and there are intricate patterns of webbed lacing all over the glass. Smell is orange, grapefruit, pineapple and dankness. Absolutely incredible. Taste is the same with a bit of bitterness on the finish. Feel is light side of medium, soft and juicy with a sticky finish. Overall this beer is absolutely immaculate. The best double IPA I've ever had by a pretty wide margin.",0.6985618633606121,4.75,0.9211
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Wow this is serious. nose it a prelude to the amazing roasty, vanilla, thick, bourbon smooth deliciousness to follow on the taste. Struggling whether this or BCBS is better, but just simply outstanding BA stout.",0.6627248345451703,5.0,0.9209
Haze,"Poured from a can dated 8/18/18 to a nonic. Very hazy, reminds me of apricot juice (in appearance). Mild fruit aroma, pineapple, orange, mango. Really a nice taste of the same fruits, finish is effervescent and mildly bitter. And thats the kicker, it changes at the end and not in an unpleasant way. Mouth feel is good also, really coats your tongue until that carbonation starts cleaning house. This is probably my favorite Tree House NEIPA and certainly one of my favorite overall NEIPAs.",0.6578251714833906,4.5,0.9209
Society & Solitude #4,Poured out as a cloudy golden color with a nice white head on top. Good retention and lacing. The smell is spewing tropical aromas and it's really enticing. The taste is very hoppy but also has a good amount of malt in there too. Overall the beer is excellent.,0.6706257725989492,4.5,0.9209
Beatification,d from a 375 ml bottle into a tulip glass  A- a bright almost neon yellow with a thin head that never goes away.   S- lots of peaches and pinneapple. Smells extremely sour. Lots of spices as well. Hard to pick out though.   T- everything blends so well. The peaches and pinneapple and other tropical fruits come through very well. The sourness makes your cheeks pucker immediately and the acidity of the beer feels like its eating my teeth. There is a smoothness on the back end that really brings it together.   M- a full beer that puckers your cheeks and leaves a strong sourness in your mouth.   O- a very good sour. I find picking out flavors in sours are difficult but the taste and smell and everything about it are outstanding.,0.6476779399977505,4.5,0.9208
Peche 'n Brett,"A fantastic beer. The weight, feel and flavor of this beer is quite darn good. The peach is consistently present without too much ""skin"" and very little sweetness. Slightly tart to give it a quenching trait. Just darn good",0.6824495154430199,4.75,0.9208
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Many, many thanks to ThoreauLikeaGirl and her friend for bringing this beer along tonight to drink during the premiere of Season 4 of ""Breaking Bad"".   From the bottle: ""Made only with malt, wheat, hops, water, and whole ripe cherries, entirely spontaneously fermented with wild yeasts. A rare, completely natural, traditional lambic beer, with no added sugars, syrups, artificial colors or flavors. For ages, very rare Schaerbeek cherries have been prized by brewers for the deep rich color and flavor they give to Kriek beer.""; ""For decades, Armand Debelder has worked as a Gueuze blender - just as his father did - mixing young and old lambics from other lambic brewers to create the classic beer of Belgium. Armand has recently begun brewing his own lambics. The Drie Fonteinen beers are among the very few traditional and authentic Gueuzes and Lambics being made in Belgium today.""  No head to speak of. Color was a cloudy raspberry red. Nose smelled of oak and cherries. I was reminded of some of the better homemade wines my uncle made while we were out in the Bay Area. Mouthfeel was medium with an initial cherry tartness on the tongue, followed by a pleasant oakiness. Finish was tart, but not puckeringly so, very cherry, underlain by oak. l like Drie Fonteinen and this was another shining example of their beers.",0.6287858937783819,4.0,0.9208
Aaron,I’ve been sitting on this for a minute. I can’t go over a 4.5 but it was delicious. Not overly hyped and not a let down either. Its a complex BA barelywine that opens as it warms. Cheers!,0.6219971296771138,4.5,0.9208

Had 2 the night of game 7, but was not rational enough to review, given the result.

Swish,"Pouring a cold 16 oz can into my snifter. The beer pours a hazy golden color with a small bleached white creamy head of 1.5 cm. The foam slowly fades to a thick edge layer and a wispy surface island.  The aroma is some pine sap mixed with tropical fruit, maybe mango and definitely some orange notes and a little peach mixed in for good measure. I also get a little bit of biscuity malt but no hint of the booze on this one. First sip reveals a silky smooth textured beer with fine rolling carbonation. Average to light body, very drinkable beer. Flavor is tropical hops with orange, mango and peach dominant. Again, some hints of biscuity malt, but the hops dominate and there is no real booze on this one here either. The finish is a little bitey with some resin hops that linger a bit on each swallow. This is a solid NE DIPA with great hop profile and character, the well hidden booze only makes it more enjoyable at the end of the can.",0.6759697548329661,4.5,0.9207
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"A: Cherry red with a brownish tinge. Light haze, and a finger of bright pink head.

Fresh sour raspberries in all their ripened glory, funky almost macaroni like taste, Cantillon Brewery in a glass with all its old wood, cobwebs and dust.    M: Medium acidic body, light foamy carbonation, dry acidic finish.    O: Yes, I bought this one at the Cantillon Brewery in Late 2013, and brought it back to China where I am drinking it April 5th, 2015. Amazing brew. Dry and sour fruit lambic as classic as it should be. It was labelled as 2011.",0.6069664800604829,4.75,0.9206
Black Tuesday,"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2017, yellow session. Brown, muddy color. Aroma is sweet and boozy. Taste follows with sweet malt and acidic/burning alcohol. Sticky, syrupy body. Really difficult to drink. 3.75/5  2014, from bottle. Big bourbon aroma and very sweet, malty taste. Medium but sticky, syrupy body. Feels more like an English Barleywine than an Imperial Stout. Expected something else but overall it was very enjoyable. 4.6/5",0.6547847930524078,4.0,0.9206

Green,"Though told to wait, I drank the day after canning and am confident that this is the perfect beer. It opens with grassy and pine notes along with a little bit of peach before descending into pure juice and finishing with a fruity sticky bitterness.

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"I've been chasing this beer for a while now - bottle counts always seem lower than other adjuncted variants, and no one seems to want to let one go. So, finally caught it on tap this year!  The beer obviously changes a bit in the barrel (see all of the variants) - what once was a cloyingly unpleasant, overly sweet beer turns in to a much more balanced, not-insultingly sweet beer that almost has a sort of buttery taste and aroma to it. It's thick and rich, of course, with lightly disguised bourbon. This feels like a trick. I almost wondered whether I had the right beer.  It's great - it still lets me down a bit, after these years of chasing... still, great.",0.62517101927481,4.25,0.92
Green,"Edit : best with 3 months of age on it.   Canned 12/12/17. Pours a hazy color not unlike orange juice, with a towering, fluffy, fuzzy 2 finger head.   Smells like the hops fridge in a homebrew store. Tons of fresh, ""green"", sharp hops with fruity notes I can only assume are of the Galaxy variety. Oranges, white grapefruit, pears, melon, soft white bread, fresh cut lawn, and peppery yeast (I'm getting a peppermint thing here) all combine to form a fantastic nose.   Flavors are remarkably different from when I had this can at a week old. It has been allowed to breathe a bit, shedding off its woody exterior and putting forth a calmer presence - but make no mistake, this beer is ALL HOPS. A sawdust and pine flavor opens, following with grapefruit, pear, melon, passion fruit, pomegranate, and then a reappearance of the woody pine qualities, slight glue, finishing on faint orange creamsickle. Nice sharpness to the overall bitterness here that cuts through the juice.   Feel is creamy, soft, sharp, and slightly resiny.   Overall, Green is not the juice bomb the other MA beers are, instead it incorporates lots of woody tones and pine among the pear, melon, and grapefruit. A tasty treat that you should try if you get the chance.",0.6861074704235818,4.5,0.92

Thanks a bunch for helping me knock out the Loons I haven’t ticked yet.This is a 2008 vintage poured into a Surly Darkness snifter.  A- Pours a deep red almost brown in color with a fingers worth of tight light pink head. Very good head retention.   S-Really nice bright jammy raspberry in the nose, it smells absolutely incredible. Reminds me of a young Hommage.   T-Flavor is tart raspberry, with a little lemon, but it’s still mostly all raspberry.  M-Light mouthfeel, good carbonation, moderate acidity, and a long tart finish.  O- I like this beer more and more everytime I have it. I still think I prefer Lou Pepe Kriek in terms of Lou Pepe’s, but this is light years ahead of Rose.",0.6215064229466482,4.5,0.9199

Black Tuesday,"Bottle shared by Umberto at Curran's tasting.  Pours a deep, dark black, with a small, quarter inch head, and not much lacing.  Smells like bourbon, chocolate, booze, caramel, and more booze.  This one is a whopper, so much here. Surprisingly, the booziness is not overpowering- it is hot as hell, but that factors in well with every other flavor, and elevates it a bit. Tons of chocolate, vanilla, caramel, burnt sugar, oak, coconut, cream, molasses. All of those flavors combine together so well into this flavor punch to the face.   Thick bodied, so gloopy and viscous. The mouthfeel is so chewy but creamy. Low carbonation. Due to the alcohol, this one is a real slow sipper.  Glad I finally got to try this one, it's a monster, but a delicious monster too. Treading the line between beer and cognac or something.",0.6323234737762401,4.5,0.9198

Pours a deep brown body with a small light brown head that reduces quickly to leave a ring of retention and no lacing.   Aromas are deep and inviting with tons of bourbon, vanilla, milk chocolate, caramel, light booziness, molasses, rye spices, vanilla beans in the background.   Taste mostly matches the nose with tons of milk chocolate, rye bourbon, vanilla beans, caramel, roasty malts, bittersweet dark chocolate, finishing sweet with more vanilla, roasty malt that lingers on the tongue for a bit, which I love. Thick, rich, mouthfeel with medium carbonation.   I really, really enjoyed this beer, the rye and molasses really melded with the bourbon barrels to give it a complex and sweet-vanilla-chocolate forward flavor and aroma profile.

I mean c'mon man, there's no way it could live up to the hype.man I've never been so beechwood aged wrong in my life.  My boy Adam was being swooped away by a double unicorn led chariot. What do I mean? It was amazing. Truly a trancendent stout. It was flat out the greatest stout ever made in America. And wel I haven't tried everyone, but I've tried everyone enough from the list.

Vicinity,"Canned on 8/21  Notes from 8/22:  Pours a light opaque orange with a thin head. Smells very hoppy, with strong citrus-y, mango-y notes. Taste is spicy and citrus-y, bright fruit character and a light malt character. There's an odd (but not unpleasant) garlicky note. Lingering bitterness typical of a DIPA. Mouthfeel is silky, lightly carbonated, and has a dry finish. A fresh, well-made IPA. Gonna wait a week and see if this improves, based on the recent talk of Trillium brews being ""too young"" at times.  Notes from 8/30: Pour is understandably the same. Hop smell has mellowed slightly, giving way to more mango and citrus. The spicy taste has mellowed out and the hop bitterness really shines through now, and the orange and mango flavors give just enough sweetness to balance it. Not as bitter as a lot of DIPAs I've had. Incredibly well balanced, and drinkable with a smooth mouthfeel.",0.7100822073209944,4.25,0.9194
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Dark chocolate, roast malt, sweet cream, vanilla, caramel, coffee, and nutty deliciousness form the decadent aroma. Eventually, coffee dominates, but the bourbon goodness accents well.  Flavor is luxurious. Cocoa dominates, with bourbon accenting. Coffee adds a modest bitterness to counter the slightly sweet malt bill. Very candy-like, with a bit of dark fruit mid palate. Finish is fairly hot, so I think another year of age would do this well.",0.6542926389399522,4.5,0.9194

T: Fruity again (peach, apricot, lemon, pineapple, strawberry?). There isn't much wood character but it is there in the background. Sour but not overwhelmingly so.  M: Pleasantly light mouthfeel with dry finish and moderate carbonation.  O: Awesome. Given the PITA that this ended up being for me to acquire, my hopes had really been built up.

Peche 'n Brett,"Reviewing Peche 'N Brett from Logsdon Farmhouse Ales out of Hood River, Oregon.  Score: 94  2012 vintage bottle served in a Goose Island Flag Snifter and enjoyed on 03/06/13.  Appearance: Dull golden straw color. Less than a coating of clump, off-white head from the pour. Poor lacing, belong average retention. 3.5/5  Smell: Ripe peach bomb! Also some straw and that smell one associates with bretted beers. Almost entirely peach on the nose. Not very complex, but smells delicious! 4.5/5  Taste: The peach flavor is not very tart and is best described as ""delicate"" -- it is ""soft"" and coats the tongue, but is not super intense. More straw than in the nose, a little funk and a little bit of grassy hops too. Has an interested finish that is acidic, hoppy and mildly tart at the same time. Tartness mellows out as it warms. A little pepper in finish. 4.25/5  Mouthfeel: Light bodied, low carbonation. Juicy mouthfeel with a little dryness on the finish. Acidic, but the acidity mellows out as it warms. 4.25/5  Overall: Not nearly as ""sour"" as anticipated, but pretty tasty nonetheless. Maybe I am just a sucker for peaches.

APPEARANCE: pours a hazy, straw color with one-finger white head that dissipated until a thin, broken layer of small bubbles remained, there is heavy lacing on the glass, lighter carbonation.  SMELL: bread, banana and cloves.  TASTE: the taste follows the nose precisely, bread, banana and clove, the taste intensified/improved as the beer warmed, this style relies more on the yeast and less on the hops for it's flavor.  PALATE: medium body and somewhat creamy.  OVERALL: I enjoy this style and this is probably going to be hard to beat, these guys have been making this beer a long time and frankly have perfected it, I will buy this again and would recommend to everyone who enjoys the style.",0.6594332162882625,4.5,0.9191

Peach nectar actually; just like the syrup you get in canned peaches.   T/M/O: That is a lot of Brett. And a lot of peach. I guess it's an accurate name!

I don't know enough about beer to say what the flavors were but I wanted to say even as a newbie I can still appreciate this beer.,0.5153266317194735,5.0,0.9186
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"375ml bottle poured into a snifter  A- pours jet black in color with a thin foamy brown head that dissipates quickly, leaving nothing behind  S- aroma opens up with tons of habanero aroma that gives a bit of heat on the nose, followed by a big hit of spicy cinnamon, cocoa, vanilla bean, toasted walnut. Light notes of caramel, raisins & fig  T- The bourbon barrel that wasn't very prevalent in the aroma, pop out immediately in the flavor, giving some peppery bourbon and oaky wet wood. Mid-palate brings out plenty of habanero heat along with cinnamon. Sweetness follows, with flavors of cocoa, vanilla cream and traces of caramel and fig. The finish gives some nuttiness, with habanero skin flavor, lingers of bourbon pepper and dark fruit  M- medium-viscous body with low carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that turns silky and creamy into a warming finish, peppery heat lingers   O- up there with the best that I've had of this style. The only thing that keeps this from a perfect taste score, it that there is a bit more heat than I prefer from this style",0.659464961946551,4.75,0.9186
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,This is beer. Admittedly had never heard of this ancient brewery after drinking Schneider and son for many years. This is my first review and this hefe was so good it compelled me to join the advocate.   Smooth bright cloudy golden glow aromatic yeasty with that slight bannana/clove flavor and sharp pinpoint carbonation. Every sip trying to find any imperfection was met with perfect balance of all characteristics again and again.,0.6829119997587969,5.0,0.9186
Sure Bet,"Haven't had Spotted Puffer, but this is my second favorite beer in the Square Grouper ""tree."" Mangoes give it a nice creamy flavor that works well with the malt. You still get plenty of tropical flavor as well. This stuff goes fast for a reason.  Edit: Puffer's just a little more preferable for me",0.6375390083401704,5.0,0.9186
Society & Solitude #4,"Originally rated years ago; finally following up with a proper review. 7/28/19  L - pours an appealing bright melon-inspired yellow haze. Boisterously sticky head with soft chinchilla-looking fur.  S - spicy, grainy grapefruit softened by lemon creamsicle and tangerine. Hints of bubblegum and peach mango tea. This is classic Hill Farmstead. One of my first forays into craft beer and these aromas will always have a special place in my cold, dead heart.   T - rich, wholesome grains, gentle yeasty acidity, and dry, herbal bitterness. Full, playful, fruity flavors of peach and mango with a dash of underripe honeydew melon. Pithy orange and an overarching citrus bite. Earthy and visceral.  F - incredibly dry and almost chalky. Smooth and powdery with a full body.  O - once again, I'm reminded why HF is a master of their craft. Delightfully balanced between flavorful juice and raw, clean, fresh bitterness.",0.70265386895639,4.5,0.9186
Madagascar,"This was close to perfect. Vanilla was natural-smelling and the bourbon did a good job of punching through any cloying sweetness from the beans and malts.   Seriously, a wonderfully executed beer. Class act.",0.6740116753396825,4.75,0.9186
Enjoy By IPA,"Big time fan of the Enjoy by series and this latest batch didn't let me down. Nice and Dank and just as good as previous editions. This one is full of bodied, floral and nice and smooth. Had that creamy feel to it that I've come to expect.  Stone has me hooked and I will be there for the next batch . Keep it flowing boys I can't get enough.",0.6194641546685583,4.5,0.9186
Sip Of Sunshine,"Little hazy untypical amber look, intriguing tropical summer smell, several layers of hops makes refreshing rich taste. Easy feeling despite 8 ABV, that might be deceiving. Overall excellent IPA. Nearly perfect.",0.6958457536317963,4.75,0.9186
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Sorry to say, I did not like this as much as the Dark Lord in a bottle. The sharpness imparted by the oak aging was almost a non-sequitur amid the usual hearty, strong, nourishing flood of savory liquor that is the Dark Lord. It was almost like having a Dark Lord Boilermaker, and that just doesn't make sense. Maybe with a few years (5 or so) it would be an improvement, but since I didn't enter the lottery for the bottle of Oak Aged Dark Lord, I may never know.   All this aside, it was one of the best beers I have had the honor to sip.",0.5680022427916793,4.5,0.9184
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"vintage 2016, First impression is the maple aroma is outstanding! Pours a nice black color with tons of coffee, chocolate, with the perfect amount of barrel coming through. Carbonation is spot on with a viscosity that is thicker than anything I've tried before. Absolutly lives up to the hype! 5/5",0.6093640392185339,5.0,0.9183
Juicy,"Nice bit of Brett on the nose. Bigger, bolder body than many HF base saisons. Sweetness is matched by the Brett and wine character. White grape. Some fruit cocktail juiciness. Lower carb than typical. Balanced notes from the barrel, Brett, and fruit flavors. Guessing the fruit comes from the barrel and maybe hops. Very interesting beer and quite delicious.",0.6664322710713307,4.75,0.9183
Enjoy By IPA,"Poured into a wide tulip glass. Big lacy white head, very much like a Belgian blonde. Big nose of grassy, earthy, and floral hops. The taste has much of the fruit and straight bitterness of their mix of hops. There is a slight green taste in the glass. Certainly a slick feel and syrupy amount of malt. The body is a little on the thinner side and carbonation medium at best. Neither detract anything from the beer; they allow the hops and all of their glory show through. This was the latest incarnation, 4-20-16. Each release seems to be close to the same recipe, IMO.",0.6531809956303841,4.5,0.9182
Beatification,"Poured from a 375 mL bottle into a Russian River stemmed glass. This was bottled on 01/10/2012.  Appearance: Pours a hazy amber and leaves a finger of nice, white head.  Smell: Tart grapes, mild tempting acidity, lemon. Refreshing aroma.  Taste: Very tart lemon, grapes, sour grapefruit, oak, orange. Much different than the mild aroma. Quite sour, but tasty.  Mouth-feel: Medium carbonation with a medium body. Quite sour which makes this not particularly smooth, but is to be expected.  Overall: I was very impressed with this sour. Exceptional smell and really delicious, this is a well-crafted beer.",0.6729621380127481,4.5,0.9182
Haze,"Poured into a snifter from a can dated ""4 20 Alright x 3"". Perfect! Dank hop aroma and less hazy than Julius or Green. Oh so fruity! Perfect IPA taste! Shared from a DLD trade!!",0.5637466104222383,4.5,0.918
Black Tuesday,"2012 Bottle. Pours a deep dark black and starts to look slightly brown as it reaches the top of the glass. Little to no head. Not quite as thick and viscous as I imagined. Aroma is nice - strong bourbon, bakers chocolate, vanilla beans, deep roasted malts and a big alcohol note. This beer is so sweet, brunt sugar, rich chocolate and booze. The beer is incredibly boozy and hot, you can taste the bourbon and a bit of oak on the finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and pretty nice. Overall it was good but not amazing. Way to sweet for me. Got down about 8 oz, which was just enough.",0.6558518746935288,4.25,0.918
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"2012 vintage (BR/3""); drank 3/5/16 @ the Yarchives.   Brown/black appearance.   Small tan head; minimal lace.   Milk chocolate, bourbon & oak notes in the nose.   Medium thick, sticky mouthfeel.   Black coffee, oak & milk chocolate flavors up front; mild raspberry notes on the finish. Booze heat emerged as this warmed.   A complex, rich treat that was easy to quaff. Well done!",0.6570364339533581,4.5,0.918
Chocolate Rain,"Had a 2015 poured into a snifter.  Very dark brown in color, not black as I would have expected. Head diminished quickly.   Overall flavor profile was nice, but I could not get beyond the cloying sweetness… I expected this beer to be sweet, but it was above and beyond what I had expected. Flavor notes of chocolate, raisin, vanilla, molasses.   The alcohol was hidden well. Although you knew it was a big beer, I didn’t think it drank like it was 18%+.   Overall, I was happy to try this one but I was not a huge fan of it. I would not seek it out.",0.6218601819142879,3.75,0.918
Haze,Beautiful pure haze light orange  Smell is mild but clean and full of fruit  Creamy feel and full of fruit. Not a ton of carbonation but tons of flavor  Certainly a dIPA but easy to drink,0.6763059272267147,4.5,0.9178
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2013  2008 vintage poured into Lost Abbey stemware.  A: Dark red with a slight orangish hue and an inch of pinkish beige froth.  S: The aroma displays an absurd amount of jammy, tart, pungent raspberry seed and flesh. It's extremely aromatic and vibrant, with an almost spicy character due to its concentration. There's a lightly sweet crackery malt foundation beneath the fruit. Oak and leather blend with earthy funk. There's a bit of vinegar in there.  T: Sweet and tart raspberry seed and flesh with jammy notes and a subtle malt presence. The fruit is explosive and abnormally expressive. Face meltingly, devastatingly, depressively fruity. Lactic, leathery, and oaky, with a delicious tartness throughout. Vinegar is light in the flavor and there's a pervasive but subtle acetic acidity throughout. Finishes heavy on the fruit with a refreshing tartness and a firm but gentle lactic presence.  M: Upper light to lower medium body with high carbonation. The mouthfeel is sticky, dry, and tannic.  Overall: By far the best bottle of Lou Pepe Framboise I've tried, though I've only had the beer a few times and mostly from older bottles. This was exceptional with a radical funky fruit presence. Highly recommended.",0.7136190495747902,4.75,0.9178
Beatification,"375ml C&C into a Teku.  A-	Pours a cloudy, semi-radioactive orange-yellow. Active carbonation constantly climbs up the sides of my tulip. Eggshell white head fizzles away quickly leaving a thin ring/wispy cap. 4  S-	Bracing acidity, lemon/zest, tart green apple, and earthy/dirt funk. Very geuze-like, but muchhhh more sour. 4.5  T- Not as scathingly sour as the nose suggested, but just about there. Puckering acidic sourness on par with straight lemon-juice. Once that fades away notes of mild/earthy funk creep in. Finishes with some juicy/fruit notes in there as well. Simple, but damn tasty. 4.  M- Carbonation is very fine/high. Very light and refreshing body. I’d love to open another one by the pool. 4.5  O- I can see why people rave about this beer, but for the effort involved I’d rather just drink Boon Mariage Parfait. Although Beat is a better brew, it’s just barely so. 4",0.6635039456156617,4.0,0.9178
Beatification,"1 year in the bottle  Pours pale straw gold, clear with half inch head that dissipates to nothing Vinuous, with the chardonnay barrel prominent. Not a ton of funk Acid up front, with some lemon peel, and white grape the dominant flavors. Lacto dominant. Bright clean and fresh flavors, not overly complex Light and refreshing feel with a light spritz of carb  overall tasty. Way better than its american peers, and moving toward the classic lambics. Not as good as the Belgians, but one of the best american wilds I have had",0.698421895330795,4.0,0.9177
Thicket,"Pours a beatufil purple with minimal lacing. Smell is of sour blackberry - sour coming from lacto, I am assuming. The blackberry is so strong. Taste follows the nose, strong sour blackberry flavor with a decently sharp acidity. Feel is super bubbly/effervescent. Very clean on the pallet. Overall, it is probably the best blackberry sour I have had, but falls well short of smooth and fuzzy",0.6893205150600323,4.25,0.9176
Enjoy By IPA,"Pours a opaque orange color with a large fluffy white head. Excellent retention and moderate lacing.  Aroma is a burst of citrus and pine, very nicely balanced.   Taste contains many traits of an excellent IPA, all contained in one beer! Pine, citrus and malt are present right off the bat. The citrus have a sweet, candied quality to them. Good amount of bitterness on the back end, with a dry finish. Definitely has a stronger malt presence than you'll typically see in IIPA's, but its a welcome addition.  Medium bodied and disturbingly drinkable for its ABV.  AFter hearing about this beer for a long whole and finally managing to get my hands on one, it definitely lived up to the hype.",0.7379885729205875,4.5,0.9176
Black Tuesday,"Was gifted a 2013 bottle by @Evilash to celebrate the birth of my son. Ended up opening it on the day my son came home from the hospital, which also happened to be my birthday. Drank over the course of 3 hours at cellar temp. This is the new gold standard for BA stouts for me personally. It is very strong, as the abv suggests, but there is a sweetness behind it that brings it into balance. If I'm lucky enough to grab another bottle at some point, I will split it with someone- I was dragging the next day!",0.4995132127908927,4.75,0.9176
Scaled Up,"16 oz. can dated 08/10/16  Pours solid dark gold orange amber with a creamy frothy white foam head. Smells ridiculously dank and tropical with gigantic mangos, peach, orange, guava, grapefruit, passionfruit, papaya, some onion, bready malt, with super dank earthy green pine and herbal grass. Tastes super dank and fruity with mango, peach, orange, guava, passionfruit, papaya, grapefruit, some bready malt, with spicy dank green earthy pine and herbal grass. Feels so juicy, smooth, creamy medium bodied with a soft, enticingly low tingly carbonation. Overall, one of the dankest, juiciest, and best DIPA and beers I've ever had. Trillium never ceases to amaze me. Really great beer!",0.6370209095947629,4.75,0.9175
Second Fiddle,"Dated 3/27/18 on the can, less than 2.5 weeks old.  Pours an unfiltered amber in the glass with 2 fingers of off-white head. First note on the nose is a wide array of florals (including lavender) followed by fresh hop cones, yellow grapefruit, honey, dankness, citrus, wet earth and a hint of pine. Taste follows the nose and explodes with fresh hops and bitter grapefruit. Mouthfeel leaves a little to be desired for an 8.2% DIPA, with a medium-light body. Aftertaste is fascinating, drying out your mouth for a few seconds and then easing off to leave a juicy citrus lingering on the palette. This is way up there with Sip of Sunshine and the like, mastering a modern take on west coast IPA, merging in some of the new east coast vibes. I'm going to have to taste them head to head in the future!",0.6574845340670223,4.5,0.9174
Society & Solitude #4,"Hazy and golden, almost apricot, fluffy head. Smell is citrus, sweet orange, and warm, fruity, sweetness. Feel is... incredible. Light carbonation that spreads evenly across the sip, so smooth and creamy... amazing. Taste is barely bitter, maybe some rind on the back. Pineapple, orange, almost vanilla sweetness... wow.",0.6644123579844368,5.0,0.9174
Vicinity,"Poured into a Trillium tulip glass.  Pours a cloudy, fresh squeezed orange juice color. Minimal head that goes away quickly with a bit of lacing on the edges.  Bright citrus notes and tropical fruits on the nose. Bit of sweetness in the aroma as well.  First sip is big orange flavor and orange peels. Bit of bitterness but more on the sweet side. Some mango can be tasted and grapefruit lingers after. Definitely a big juice bomb. There is some yeast flavor and as it warms there are notes of cracker from the malts.  Bit of a medium body with some stickiness to it. Very light carbonation.  It was like drinking a big glass of juice. An adult version of juice. Very tasty and almost forgot I was drinking a beer. At 8% you gotta be careful not to forget. I really wanted something more of a complex smell from this DIPA but all I got was oranges. When this comes back around I'll be making sure I pick up some more. Trillium never ceases to amaze me.",0.6540259995209764,4.25,0.9173
Aaron,I am not typically a barley wine drinker but the sweetness of this beer is so well offset by the vanilla oak presence I am left longing for the next sip. This beer just transcends style and showcases the HF BA program. Yet again impressed.,0.6174838426829575,4.75,0.9171
Nelson,This an outstanding rye IPA. Nice and hoppy and yummy. This is a top tier selection and I will actively seek out this brewer again. Hard to find locally here in Ohio.,0.6095659154937587,4.25,0.9169

Sang Noir,"On tap at Brewberry Bar in Paris, France. Poured in a 12.5cl tasting glass. Well well, the balance of this beer is amazing the wine notes and bourbon notes mellows quite well and go along the dark berries sourness of the ale with wonder. Amazing beer.",0.5793319725663151,4.75,0.9169

Coolship Red,"Dec 2015 bottle split w Lisa at home. Fruit has faded a bit, esp in the nose, recommend drinking on the fresh side.

Aaron,"Bottle poured into snifter.  A very fine looking beer, dark red tinted brown with an off-white head that stays around for a bit then settles into ring around the glass.   Toffee, dried fruits, bourbon and oak, nothing out of place.  Smooth flavors meld together beautifully. Dark dried fruits with a touch of sweet toffee, bourbon, oak, candied cherries and hint of booze.  Velvet smooth, heavy side of medium body and light carbonation.  A great brew to sip on in the cold weather.",0.6567782777807566,4.5,0.9168
Black Tuesday,"Raul did it, yes his did! Black Tuesday '11 on tap at The Bruery.  More than Raul's Persian girlfriend in high school; more than 1001 Nights... This damn thang is silky smooth! Hot damn! Dripping down my throat like a precious drop of water off a stalagmite tip from Carlsbad Caverns! Oooo baby!  Now relax, my children, it ain't all unicorns and rainbows like a sorority girl's brain waves; it's a bit boozy on the tongue and nose, and when Raul says a ""bit,"" he means, a sand speckle ""bit.""   All in all, Raul does it, Raul does it good. Still, it's kind of a one and done sort of thang (like Raul's Gucci wearing princess in high school). But like said hoochie, Raul knows that he will have dreams of coming back.",0.44512657118111604,4.5,0.9168
Sip Of Sunshine,"y excellent DIPA. Somewhat pale orange color with moderate head and moderate retention. Complex aromas of pink grapefruit, lemon rind, and papaya. The palate is absolutely outstanding – very flavorful and complex. A distinct note of dried apricot leads to a ridiculously long and perfectly dry finish. Highly recommended. [10 oz. on tap]",0.7628090346388678,4.5,0.9167
Chocolate Rain,"A: Pours not completely opaque, but dark black with some ruby brown around the edges. A tiny bubbly head forms and recedes to nothing in a second. Looks really still. S: Very boozy up front. Some bakers chocolate, vanilla and roast comes through. Huge barrel aromas that overpower everything. T: Like the nose, all barrel and not much else comes through. Some bakers chocolate and vanilla. Light roast. Mostly boozy ethanol and barrel flavors. M/D: Still carbonation with a thick, gloppy, resinous body. Oh, the alcohol here is rough. Crass and over barring in almost every way. Really hard for me to enjoy this.  Oh man, I just don't get this. Beers like Bourbon County are so much more well rounded and incorporated to me. This is the newest release, so hopefully this mellows with time. Though as is, just over barring and not something I really enjoyed.",0.6345483898509227,4.5,0.9167
Mastermind,"Canned 6/6/19, drank 7/5/19. Can has notation, “HarrisMillis”. Is this pineapple juice or a beer?

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Coded 1128 on the back label of the bottle, which translates to 3/21/18, ~3.5 months since brewing.  Pours a cloudy deep golden straw in the glass with almost four fingers of dense creamy head. One of the best heads on a beer I've ever had. Nose starts off with spicy clove that transitions into a bread pudding consisting of fresh bananas, wheat bread and vanilla. I also get some white grapes, cinnamon and cardamom at the end. Taste follows the nose closely; it's crazy how close this is to a well made banana bread pudding. Big clove, cooked banana, wheat bread, cinnamon and vanilla stand out on first taste. The rest of notes of the nose follow closely afterwards with an addition of yeastiness that I didn't catch initially. Creamy medium body with consistent small bubbled carbonation. Medium-high sweetness, so if you're not looking a big desert-like punch of flavor, this isn't for you. I can't get over how well this is brewed and how distinct the taste is, even from other Hefeweizen. You can pretty much pick this up from anywhere these days and it's not one you want to miss.",0.6608168165481952,4.5,0.9166
Beatification,"At the Russian River brewpub. Awesome timing, as I happend to be in NoCal on the weekend it was released. 375ml bottle poured into a goblet. Poured with a finger of foamy white head. Cloudy straw-colored body, and the head dissipated quickly with no lacing on the glass. Smelled SOUR! Vinegery brett all throughout the intense aroma. Some citus as well. Tasted as I expected from the smell- citrusy sour and tangy. Excellent flavor that lingers for a while. Lots of zip in the mouthfeel, fairly lightweight, and very fitting for the taste. Overall, an excellent wild ale, but extremely sour, so definitely not for everyone. Gotta grab a few bottles to take home...",0.6668940468682123,4.5,0.9165
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Pours jet black with a ittle bit of chocolate colored foam.  Smell is rich and sweet, with notes of walnuts, chocolate, coffee, golden syrup and vanilla.  Taste takes all the elements from the nose and adds oak, booze and slightly hot chilis.  Mouthfeel is full, well carbonated.  Overall, a very good stout, with just a little bit too much heat from the chillis for me.",0.6380749997686797,4.0,0.9165
Green,"Look: very hazy, kinda reminds me of pulp free orange juice. About half an inch of head  Spell: very light and citrus  Taste: you get a full citrus blast, pineapple, orange and grape fruit? The taste doesn't diminish at all, perfectly balanced  Feel: light and airy, no nasty after taste, it's extremely crisp and clean. Overall: this is the single best IPA I've ever had.... well worth the drive to the middle of nowhere.",0.7231444013565772,4.5,0.9163

Enjoy By IPA,"Enjoy by 420. Poured a golden straw yellow with a hint of orange. Smells of floral and pine. Taste of grassy, floral and pine resin. A bit of citrus but it is really a afterthought in this one. Very earthy IPA. Very enjoyable. Excellent mouthfeel and finishes smooth and dry.",0.6780244773428789,4.0,0.9162
Green,Compared side by side with several other competitors within the NE IPA style category and this was the best of the bunch. Shockingly crisp and smooth for its ABV. I could drink this all day and all night. A worthy contender for not only best NE IPA but best IPA.,0.5649105505596902,4.5,0.9161
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"Had this on tap at Tree House. The beer had a black appearance with a pretty dark, brown head. Aromas were very rich with chocolate, malt, vanilla, coffee; surprisingly not much of a boozy smell. The taste was out of this world; it tasted like chocolate milk, maybe even bordering on a chocolate milkshake. The body was creamy, but relatively light. Overall, a fantastic milk stout, especially with the aromas.",0.6551765359535845,4.25,0.9161
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"This Hefe is quite nice for the style with noticable clove & banana flavours but I'm no expert on the style & frankly the style is not one of my favourites. I'm doing this short review largely for my own records so if you're looking for Hefe advice, you'll need to look elsewhere. That said, as a lover of IPAs & stouts, I would gladly enjoy one of these on a hot day if it were offered, but I won't likely go out of my way to get one.",0.6014205691719412,4.0,0.9161
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"12oz bottle courtesy of ovaltine. Bottled October 16, 2018, per the rear label.  Poured into a stemmed tulip glass, this came out the bottle like a river of crude oil, and assumed in the glass a darkness that was utterly impervious to light. Tiny, mocha colored head that nevertheless stuck around, showing a lot of pluck for such a boozebomb beer. Streaky lace that while infrequent, was more elaborate than I expected for the reason just noted.  Big nose to this. No way you can lift this up to your nose and doubt it was bourbon barrel aged. Oakey, boozy barrel aroma, with a touch of vanilla and toffee, beguile the workers at the olfactory. At the same time, it's not a big, crude, ""hot"", almost medicinal type of booziness, unlike some really big BBA stouts I've had. It almost seems wrong to use ""subtle"" as a descriptor for this beer's nose. So, I won't, but it's undeniably smooth.  Similar to the nose, but more complex, in it's own big, badass way. Up front there's bourbon, some coffeeish char notes, a little toffee, and even a little nougat. There's a faint, hoppy bitterness towards the end, and the aftertaste is where the big booze bite you've been expecting to encounter finally raises it's head.  Fairly thick body to this, with a creamy, smooth, velvety mouthfeel.  Wow. This is a decadent beer. Perhaps I should've waited until after dinner to hit this. Not sure I can follow this with another new beer anytime soon that won't be affected by this one. Incredibly smooth now, but I bet it's pretty amazing after being laid down for a while as well. Thanks, Mike! This was a longtime want for me and damn did it deliver!",0.6557269901283035,4.5,0.9161
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"I had this on tap at DLD 2008. The beer was massive in every way, especially mouthfeel (like the standard Dark Lord). This beer is rich, so full of flavor and so filling, it's an experience which is hard to describe. Oily black beer, thick enough that it almost feels like solid chocolate cake, complete annihilation of the senses in terms of aroma, flavor, and presence. I couldn't really detect any oak flavors, probably because subtle nuances like that are hard to separate from the overkill of flavors.  Probably you can only find this at special festivals (such as DLD), but I recommend you try it if you have the opportunity.",0.6753344460406426,4.0,0.9159
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"750 mL bottle. Very cloudy yellow body. Smells fascinating. Lime, grapefruit, and a strong pine woody aroma. Tastes equally good. Lime and grapefruit citrus. Sweet pale malt. Some of that pine woodiness in the finish, but it's a little muted. Medium body. Absolutely delicious.",0.6719828738780287,4.25,0.9159
Sip Of Sunshine,"This is a very nice and well-balanced beer. A genuinely solid and well-crafted representation of the style. But based upon my one draft sampling, I found absolutely nothing to really distinguish it from the many outstanding IIPAs being brewed in my neck of the woods. And yet they don't have scores like this...   Maybe they are all under-rated, or maybe this one is over-rated. Or maybe both. Regardless, great beer abounds all across America.",0.6306671764553846,4.5,0.9158
Haze,"Pours hazy and looks like orange juice in the glass though tad more towards yellow than straight orange. The smell follows the look on this one. Orange up front along with peach notes. Going along with the balance the beer, the taste follows the nose as the nose follows the looks. Sweet up front with orange citrus predominating. The back end is very balanced and not that bitter at all. Notes of orange candy linger. The feel is medium thick. Overall this is an amazing beer; orangey and tasty!",0.6532886300976479,5.0,0.9157
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Pour is viscous and color is stark, shiny black with a thin but dense mocha blanket that dies off to a bubbly film and thick collar.  It sure smells like Expedition!--starting with the classic dark molasses and licorice notes up front, but with more chocolate roasted malt. Some mocha coffee notes are there, and plenty of nutty wood is also asserting itself, which is almost like peanut butter, but at the same time as though it's splintery and dry. This is very unique--the label art goes well with this aroma!  Taste is tangy, heavily roasted mocha malt with a little less licorice than the base. More bourbon than wood comes through on the palate than the nose, and it tastes quite hot with a little peppery spiciness and a hint of maple and smokey raisin. However, it really doesn't taste all that drastically different or barrel-aged to be honest.  This beer is slick, round, viscous, thick and delicately luscious at first, but as it goes down there's a bit of a burn and tingle, with a little chew and a semi-dry finish.  I'm having this very freshly bottled--dated June 2017.  ---  The 2018 bottles were drastically, depressingly worse and I'm not sure how they could get so far off track. I'm keeping my original review above but buyer beware, 2018 is metallic, astringent and just not enjoyable.",0.6721846774444854,4.25,0.9157
Haze,"oh wow, took a while for me to get my hands on this but it was well worth the wait, very smooth and virtually no alcohol prominence whatsoever, for a 8.2 very smooth and drinkable, a grapefruit IPA with orange showing slightly on finish, wish it could be a regular for me....great feel and carbonation, a smooth sipper that improved with it warming in glass",0.6739189357754625,4.75,0.9154

Green,"Served in my Spiegelau IPA glass. Pours a dull orange with a hazy clarity and a tight, fluffy, one inch, off-white head embedded with tiny pinpricks. Head eventually settles into a consistent, 1/8th inch cap with delicate textured strands of lacing revealed as it disperses. Great nose - citrus pith, rind and a hint of tropical fruit (perhaps guava). Taste follows nose, with the addition of a kiss of breadiness at the finish that lightly lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an even carbonation and a touch of acidity. Not much to say about this one. Quite tasty and characteristic of the style. Happy to have had the chance to try it.",0.6886786967569156,4.0,0.9153
Very GGGreennn,"Near perfect NEIPA. Drinks like it's 4% without any of the bitterness green has. Amplifies everything you like about very green and dials it up a couple notches. mouthfeel is softer than even Very Green. Soft citrus and ripe pineapple combine to make this beer amazing. The mouthfeel, taste, smell, all of it A+. Possibly my favorite IPA",0.6989193446403656,5.0,0.9153

Mastermind,"Very hazy, looks like pineapple juice. Smells tropical and minty, mild pine. Taste is fantastic and unique.

Crazy complex, very very easy drinking. Great mouthfeel.",0.6827345856632053,4.5,0.9153
Haze,"Pours hazy, orange-yellow in color, with one inch head. Look exemplifies the New England hazy ipa style. Taste is orange, tangerine, peach, and dank wet hops. The orange really jumps as the beer warms. Super light bodied for the style. No beer with this high an ABV has the right to be this smooth. Of the ten or so Tree House brews I have had and it may be the best IPA I have ever had. Just an amazing beer.",0.6280852735924652,4.75,0.9153
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Fresh 750ml poured into HF stemware. I thoroughly enjoyed every sip of this brew. The mouthfeel was excellent, soft in the same way that HF ipas are.

Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,"375ml bottle poured into a snifter  A- pours a deep black color with a one-finger khaki colored head that reduces to a ring around the edge  S- smells of smoky charred malt, dark chocolate, espresso, fudge brownies & caramel. Plenty of barrel character, including wet oak, bourbon, vanilla & coconut  T- opens with big, rich mocha fudge brownie, followed by notes of caramel, walnuts, molasses, fig, date & dark chocolate. Mid-palate gives some barrel character, adding earthy wood, vanilla and toasted coconut. The finish gives a malty sweetness, that lingers of bourbon, caramel and charred malt  M- medium-thick body with moderate carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that continues into a velvety warming chewy finish   O- thick, fudge ad bourbon.

Mastermind,"2014-10-21 12oz can poured into a tulip. 10/02/14 IHC is printed on the bottom. Purchased locally about a week and a half ago, transported in luggage back to WA.  Pours clear gold at first, then the sediment gets to work clouding the whole thing up into a yellow gold. Head is medium sized, pale, and dissipates slowly, leaving thick sheets of lacing. Smell is quite notably good, with the gorgeous fruity aromas I'm starting to associate with northeastern IPAs. Citrus, pineapple, juicy. Smells very nice.  Taste is much milder, but along the same lines as the aroma, and very pleasant. More emphasis on pine/citrus rind bitterness, less on the bright fruity stuff. Slow, dry, bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is light and dry. Overall, quite good beer.",0.6830718812142407,4.25,0.9152
Beatification,"At last got my hands on this RR classic! Golden orange with no head save a clear ring. Wonderful aromas of oak, wet earth, lemon, grass, hay, grapefruit zest, barrel must, and grains. Taste is more acidic and vinegar forward, but has all the same flavors from the smell, with an ending backed by sour oak and plenty of funk, but also leaves the palate pretty citrus sweet. Not the most complex, but plenty flavorful. Feel is tart, funky and has a vinegar artful harshness.",0.689179273625799,4.5,0.9151
Dragonsaddle,"Look - Golden orange type color. Very slight haze most mostly clear in appearance.  Smell - Dank, candied orange sweetness, pine, slight tropical fruits like pineapples.

Aroma is lemon, grapefruit, touch of pine, some other fruits like orange, apricot show up later. Taste is Similar, touch of the metallic hop Taste, but not in a bad way. Stronger smoother tastes come out later, probably because of the rye.  Imho, this is way better than pure hoppiness.  **",0.6396796127918668,4.25,0.9149

Black Tuesday,"This beer gets all the credit in the world for being not just drinkable but also enjoyable. Smooth, robust and memorable is how I describe this monster. The alcohol heat is noticeable but not astringent or sharp - it's like a slowly rising heat that starts low in the glass and comes to the fore when you tilt it towards your mouth, and then back again as it slides down your throat. Really cool cascade of an element that, in lesser hands, could demolish the beer completely.  Oak, bourbon, chocolate, burnt toast, char, roasted coffee grounds, dark cherry, faint vanilla. Thick, chewy and viscous. Black with swirls of light khaki foam coloring the surface. Intense, pleasurable and memorable. Had a few ounces on tap so I have no idea how many BAs it takes to put down a bottle...I can only guess. If it comes in a 750ml it should be considered a weapon.",0.6785843137383428,4.25,0.9148
Vicinity,"Two day old growlette poured into a tulip glass.   L: Pours murky white golden with less than 1 finger of quickly dissipating white head that left minimal spotted lacing.  S: Great nose, very tropical. Plenty of orange and mango, more subtle notes of passionfruit, pineapple and papaya.   T: Follows the nose to a large degree, but with more citrus prominence. Finishes with moderate bitterness and acidity, bitterness clears quickly while the acidity lingers. I liked that it wasn't crazy sweet juice.  F: Medium bodied with medium-high carbonation, lively on the tongue with some burn from the carbonation and acidity, slick on the swallow.   O: Loved the nose and taste, didn't feel this hit the normal creamy mouthfeel of a Trillium NEIPA. Liked the bitterness element, and would gladly repeat if given the opportunity.",0.6815367815316243,4.5,0.9147
Nectarine Premiere,"I don't see how a wild can get any better than this! Pour is nectarine orange and opaque, with a fizzy short lasting head, but a bountiful ring of nectarine pulp decorating the rim of the glass all the way around that's there to stay. Nose is definately nectarine with some peach and star fruit, and taste is all nectarine. Mouthfeel is softly carbonately and tart on the finish. This thing is so good. Nice job de Garde!",0.6376618922030483,4.75,0.9147
Green,"Pours an opaque, bright orange with a hint of yellow. Head formation is one finger in height after a slow, conservative pour straight into the glass. Head is white, with good retention and lacing. Aroma is a citrus minefield, sprinkling notes of orange, papaya, and mango over a doughy biscuit malt base. Aroma is well crafted, with a modest appeal. It's not loud, or brash, or over stuffed with citrus puree. Flavor profile is orange, papaya, mango, lemon zest, and a dash of grapefruit. Flavor profile packs considerably more notes than the aroma, carrying the 7.5% ABV beer well. There is a touch of bitterness at the finish of this beer. Malts are present, but stuffed well behind the hops storyline. Malts hit notes of biscuit, and bread. Mouth feel is just a touch fizzy, and grainy, but otherwise crisp. Its medium thickness leaves a little residue on the tongue, generating a long lasting flavor and presence on the palate. Overall, a well crafted, balanced NE IPA. It hits balanced citrus notes well, without being over the top or a show-off.  Served in a 12oz snifter from a 16oz can.",0.701633138432347,4.75,0.9144
Chocolate Rain,"2015 vintage. Pours dark brown, verging on black with a small tan head that dissipates very quickly. The aroma is vanilla, bourbon, Belgian yeast esters, chocolate, alcohol and oak. Taste is extremely sweet with chocolate and bourbon leading the charge and leaving little space for anything else to play on the stage. Mouthfeel is thin for a big beer. Very good overall. A fantastic desert beer.",0.6499706995158675,4.5,0.9144
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"(Bottle, thanks to SQNfan) If Blursimarsi cannot come to Dark Lord Day, then Dark Lord Day has to come to Blursimarsi. Pours compact dark brown to black. The aroma is fat with oak/bourbon up front bringing tones of vanilla, coconut, light smoke and alcohol. In addition, lots of malt roasts with dark chocolate and chocolate ice cream as the most notable but there is also some room for coffee/espresso. Sweet sugary and dark fruity with tones of molasses, maple syrup, rum raisins and prunes. Hints of raspberries, nuts and celery. The flavour is medium to heavily sweet, light to medium bitter and medium to heavily roasted/burned. Bourbon, vanilla, coconut, dark chocolate, rum raisins, burned caramel, some coffee, mint-ish alcohol warmth, molasses and light smoke. The mouthfeel is extremely fat and oily yet smooth, soft and velvety with a balanced sticky ending. Aftertaste of bitter chocolate, coffee, bourbon hop dryness and molasses. Full bodied. Extreme but well balanced. Wow!",0.6482252706538708,4.5,0.9143

Sip Of Sunshine,"Very foamy, thick head with a slight orange/brown tinge. The top looks like cream. Top bubbles are very fine, but lower are bigger; dissipates quickly. Lacing is excellent.   Pours a translucent golden orange with some very fine particles visible when held up to light.   Aroma is not that strong, but there is pine and malt and hops present. Definitely an IPA, but a well-rounded aroma.   The feel is not as full as some of it’s hazy hop bomb DIPA neighbors, but it is very balanced. Begins with a measured burst of piney, almost sweet carbonation. I find the the level of the carbonation itself very nice.  This beer doesn’t try to overdo anything. The hops are present but not overpowering, and there is a malt characteristic at the end, accompanied by lasting bitterness and earthy hop flavor with maltly sweetness. The taste really does last awhile after the swallow.",0.6877508092811779,5.0,0.9142
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"750 ml bottle, bottled April 26, 2011, poured into a snifter.  A- Pours a deep red cherry color, with a thin layer of fluffy pink head.  S- Huge sour cherry aroma, tartness is mild, some musty yeast and oak.  T- Powerful tartness up front, layered underneath it is a lot of sour cherry pie flavors and some funky yeast with a bit of oak.  M- Medium-bodied, well-carbonated, has a crisp feel with some puckering from the sourness.  O- An excellent kriek, every bit as good as Cantillon kriek, the flavors are simple but done extremely well. It's a pricey beer but is definitely worth trying.",0.6827447148013028,4.5,0.9142
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"On cask at Moeder Lambic on 4/7/2013. Pours a beautiful raspberry hue, slightly hazy in clarity, with a fluffy, cloud-like, light pink head similar to the color of cotton candy. Nose expresses citrus, rind, cork and a wisp of raspberry essence at the back. Taste consistent with nose - no real surprises here. Citric acid is very assertive in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light in body, puckeringly tart and lightly stimulates the salivary glands. Overall, a very good fruit lambic; however, I'd like to have had a little more raspberry flavor.",0.6934219669052896,4.25,0.9141

Todd The Axe Man,"Had on tap and in can. A favorite of my year in and year out since I have had it. Taste is lush and rich, with great depth in the hop tastes, plenty of dank bitterness, pine, orange, grapefruit, nectarine, lemon zest, pineapple, mango and guava. Feel is the perfect level of carbonation, decent thickness, with some dank ipa stickiness, and smooth finish.

Oude Geuze Vintage,"2005 vintage, 37.5cl bottle from In de Verzekering tegen de Grote Dorst (Lennik, Belgium)  Damp, musty basement, mushroom-y, cheesy funk, but with more intensity than the regular Oude Gueuze upon first whiff. An unexpected wave of honey is also mixed into the initial gueuze-y funk, with some tart lemon nearby the end as expected.  A lot more acidic than I expected, and more notes of vinegar than the regular Oude Gueuze. Here's the kicker -- it's surprisingly sweet. The tried and true oak, funky cheese, and leather flavors follow. Wow I must be a goddamn masochist to enjoy these kind of flavors in a beer.  Medium body, well-carbonated, and dry to the bone on the finish; my lips did pucker quite a bit toward the end, but not as much as it would with American Wilds.",0.6072079732955113,4.25,0.9136

Swish,"Fresh can (canned on 1/1/2015)- reviewed 1/3/2015  What can I say- amazing- BB combined my favorite hops, added an solid malt base and canned it so as soon as you pop the top it's like a sensory overload of citra, simcoe, mosaic and Apollo. I think they use a similar yeast to heady topper(although completely different and I am not inferring that it is trying to be heady because it is not) so the yeast really accentuates the fruit notes, peach, nectarine etc. I don't find it overly bitter, but the taste is like a juicy, fruity, Citrus bomb. It's like running naked through a simcoe hop field and then jumping in a citra bath and using mosaic soap and Apollo shampoo. Great job BB.",0.6557603788141947,4.5,0.9136

An amazing beer that is deep, thick, chewy, and fudgy with a nice bite from the rye malts. Really enjoyed this RIS and will continue to look for it!

Chocolate Rain,"Reviewed from notes  A- Pours mostly black with dark brown hues around the edges. A small off-white head dissipates quickly, leaving no lacing.  S- The aroma is very in your face. Tons of whiskey, thick chewy fudge, vanilla, and oak. Alcohol soaked dark fruits, namely prunes, dates, and figs are also prevalent.  T- The flavor is sweet as expected. The most prominent flavors are actually the dark fruits previously mentioned. Roasted malts and a bit of bitter baker's chocolate make an appearance. The fudge and vanilla play supporting roles. There's big bourbon alcohol in the finish.  M- The mouth feel is super thick, smooth, and velvety. Just the right amount of carbonation. A significant, but not overwhelming amount of warming booze.  O- This is basically like drinking bourbon-soaked dark fruits with vanilla and fudge. A very tasty imperial stout!",0.6651003182669414,4.5,0.9133
Chocolate Rain,"Pours a dark brown with some tan head, and some clarity around the edges. The aroma starts with heavy bourbon and oak paired with candy sweetness. Loads of cacao comes in towards towards the end which tempers the intense sweetness. Some light vanilla highlights noticeable at the very end. The flavor follows suit with the nose. It starts very sweet with the heavy cacao quickly following. Notes of cream, coconut, and vanilla come through as the sweetness subsides with one last wave of dark chocolate at the end. The mouthfeel is thick with mild carbonation. Overall, a nice feature of cocoa, very sweet, strong, but well balanced considering its monstrous 18% abv.",0.6917737428223549,4.5,0.9133
Space Trace,"L: Dark onyx hues with a thin rusty head  S: Suntan lotion and German chocolate cake - smells like a decadent dessert T: A liquefied piece of thick German chocolate cake complete with coconut, milk chocolate, pecans, and vanilla beans F: Medium bordering on thick mouthfeel with a subtle amount of carb O: Vast improvement on the base beer in my opinion. The barrel aging enhances the mouthfeel and the coconut and vanilla pop much more in this iteration. Overall this is a decidedly smooth and rich stout that faithfully deconstructs a rich dessert into liquid form. A touch hot at this point, but a few more months of aging and this thing will be outrageous. Certainly deserves to be in the conversation among the better coconut BA stouts like Prop 13, Snowed In, Coconut Medianoche, etc.",0.6529742799487289,4.75,0.9132

Todd The Axe Man,"Spectacular beer! Very effervescent and slightly hazy golden color with a head that foamed up, then relaxed to a fizzy, thin layer. Smells apricot sweet up front, maybe leaning towards a melon side that wraps up with just some hints of pine. Taste follows the nose for the most part, but pine kicks in a bit faster, but otherwise very much like the nose. Bitter yet sweet with apricot melon pine in a solidly medium bodied beer that leaves behind a hint of sweetness.",0.6781289493081701,4.5,0.9129
Sang Noir,"2012 on tap at brew pub. Ruddy chocolate brown with a few bubbles of tan head sticking to the snifter. Aromas of rich dark cherries, red wine and bourbon. Smells like a mouthful. Taste is quite sour. The sourness overpowers the flavors present. I get cherries and some woody bourbon but the sour acetic/citric acid notes overpower the rest. This takes away from my enjoyment. Mouthfeel is dry and and thin with a sour aftertaste.overall a sour buddy with a nice aroma that is overshadowed with sour.",0.6336170992441192,3.75,0.9127

Swish,"Appearance: Pours hazy and goldenstraw colored, with a solid cap of foam that hangs around for a while, leaving swaths of lacing  Smell: Dank, with tropical fruit tones of papaya, passionfruit and berry; tangerine and grapefruit pith round out the aromatics  Taste: Mellow fruit forward, with the passionfruit out front and the papaya and berry tones underneath; through the middle, the dankness building along with citrus tones of grapefruit and, to a lesser extent, tangerine; surprisingly bitter, for the style, after the swallow, with a dry finish that includes quite a dose of aspirin  Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate carbonation  Overall: Glad to have the opportunity to try this but I don't feel this one should be in the top 100  Thanks, PhineasMcClintock, for the opportunity",0.687269465262312,4.25,0.9127
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Chilled bottle into a glass. 2007 vintage (made with 2009 harvest), purchased at the brewery and shared with some friends in London. The brewer remarked that this year's fruit crop was excellent. Reviewed from notes.   A: Pours a hazy magenta color in the glass, with a frothy pink head that reveals its high effervescence. Retention is poor, as expected for this style, and the final result is a thin halo with no lacing down the sides.   S: Tart, slightly sour raspberry notes hit the nose first. They are joined by oak, leather, must, and whispers of barnyard funk.   T: Starts off seemingly sweet with a raspberry-dominated flavor, but it reveals itself to be tart, sour, very well attenuated, and uber-dry, nearly burning in the back of the throat. Swirling in the mouth and sampling the beer's myriad flavors turns up a woodsy flavor, leather, and hints hay / must / horse blanket.   M: Acidic and cuttingly dry, reminding us of potential heartburn problems. Light-bodied and lively.   D: Out of the 3 Lou Pepes I opened, this was our least favorite. An excellent and complex flavor, but more austerely dry than any of us really preferred. I'd get it again but I would pair it with food.",0.6760919874700527,4.0,0.9127
Caffè Americano,"L - Pitch, opaque black with a thin dark tan head that dissipates quickly leaving behind no head.  S - Rich roasted, bitter espresso and coffee along with dark chocolate and roasted/toasted grains  T - Complex but follows the nose: Rich, roasted, bitter espresso and coffee up front and throughout along with notes of dark chocolate, and a slight hint of sweetness from the vanilla at the end. Fudge - very rich. Molasses and charred wood/smoke. Roasted and toasted malts/oats throughout.  F - Full bodied with a light to moderate amount of carbonation. Somewhat thick and oily but smooth. Somewhat leans more towards the medium end of the spectrum in terms of body.  O",0.6791044291171249,4.75,0.9125
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2008 bottle at Cantillon Brewery.  Slightly hazy, red/amber appearance. This has to be the strangest beer I have ever smelled. Extremely complex which is difficult to describe. Raspberry is definitely present on the nose, but there is this funky aroma that is overpowered by all kinds of notes. Just very strange. The taste doesn't follow the nose as much. That funk is still there but raspberry sour, other red fruits, almond, nutmeg, barnyard hay, funky cheese.... it's all somehow blended perfectly. Oaky for sure! The aftertaste is smooth with light carbonation/fizzy feel. Could sip on this beer all day long and enjoy every sip. But I simply could not stop smelling the beer. Probably took 2-3 whiffs for every sip.",0.675972671692042,4.75,0.9124
Enjoy By IPA,"Stone is back in WI and I get to have my first ever Enjoy By! 7.4.16 bottled about a week ago. Poured 12oz bottle into snifter. A clear dark gold with streams of bubbles ascending to the 3 finger white pillowy head. Retention is amazing and leaves a cap with very thick lacing on my glass. Aroma is very fruity with some nice citrus and dank hops. Sweet tropical notes. Flavor is more tropical and juicy with faint notes of bubblegum and a bitter finish. Feel is medium with an oily feel, but slightly dry on the finish. I had no idea this was close to 10% ABV! What a treat, glad to finally try one.",0.6415631872693598,4.5,0.9124
Haze,"Look- thick pineapple juice with a little OJ thrown in as well  Smell- Nice and Airy. Got whiffs of peach, mango, orange. A bit of pepper undertones  Taste- Really nice sweetness. Starts off with Melon and Earthiness. Flavor crescendos into sweetness like biting into a juicy peach. You can taste the hoppiness of this beer without a major bite. It's really enjoyable  Feel- carbonation and fullness really shine. Tree house is known for creaminess. This may be the best they offer in this regard.  Overall- a real sleeper. Very drinkable. The feel as good as anything out there. Just quality. Not my favorite but I can understand why it would be someone's. A dark horse",0.6806469618827142,4.75,0.9124
Sure Bet,"Poured into 12oz snifter.  L: well, this beer is definitely unfiltered. Pure golden haze. A finger of head dissipates into sticky lacing a few moments after the pour.  S: pure tropical fruit. Sticky mango, melon, just dominate the nose. Like a glass of citrus punch.  T: Follows the nose beautifully. Sweet honey, mango, with the citra hops coming in nicely in the finish, followed by a subtle bitterness.  F: Light and carb-y,   O: Another knockout of a IIPA from pipeworks. Just a pleasure to drink.",0.6359125467221064,4.75,0.9124
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"2008 Vintage. Poured from a foiled, corked and caged 750ml bottle into a Cantillon tulip. Like wearing Addidas pants with Nike sneakers... Shared with schen9303.   Pours a 1 finger frothy pink head with low retention. Beer is a dark, semi-clear ruby. Lacing is non-existant but with decent legs. Slightly above average due to the color.   Nose is tart cherry, some cobweb and hay funk. Some yeasty sharpness. Not overly funky or cheesy but with a robust fruit aroma. Nice.   Opens tart cherry, some yeasty spiciness. More big semi-sweet cherry notes towards the middle. Cobweb, wet hay, and barnyard funk. Yeasty fruit throughout. Some light bitterness. Cinnamon and oak notes towards the end. Finish is tart cherry puree with some band-aid taste. Really fruit forward, funky, and tart. Exceptional.   Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Light but lively in the mouth and some bubbles going down. Dry finish with a puckering and dry, lingering aftertaste. Really accents the flavor well.  While its not the most impressive looking or smelling fruit lambic, Schaerbeekse Kriek is definitely among the most fruit forward and tastiest. Probably one of, if not the most impressive widely available lambic out there now. Fresh vintages take almost completely blow away the competition in my opinion. Worth the hefty price tag.",0.6822784509893736,4.5,0.9124
Black Tuesday,"Pours an inky black with glimmers of brown cola, scant head but surprising carbonation. Aroma is bursting with dark cacao supported by bourbon caramel, espresso, oak & anise.   Not surprisingly, the barrel characteristics really dominate the palate - tons of boozey caramel & vanilla upfront, some fudge bark & burnt chocolate after that. On the backend there is definitely a sharp anise / black licorice flavor that helps counter some of that sweetness. Finishes with more bourbon heat & bitter anise.   Thought it was a little bit thin, and a tad too hot on the booze (but I mean, for a 19% beer whadda ya expect?) but I liked that it wasn’t just a sweet bomb and had some earthier notes.",0.6367865634433357,4.5,0.9124

Society & Solitude #4,"On tap at Positive Pie. Served out of a Hill Farmstead snifter. Reviewed from notes.   Served with a .5 finger white head which dissipated quickly. Spotty lace with good stick. Beer is cloudy honey. Clarity hurts, but solid on all other fronts.  Nose is honey, citrus, sap hop bitterness, papaya, peach, and other tropical fruit. Moderately aromatic. Very good.  Opens citrus sweetness. Papaya, tree sap hoppiness packs a bitter punch that's balanced out by a tropical fruit malt body that emerges towards the middle. Citrus comes out even more towards the end. Finishes with a hop creaminess that fades into a bitter aftertaste. Perfect.  Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Abrasive and lively in the mouth and smooth going down. Messy finish with a lingering aftertaste. Complements the flavor profile amazingly.  Another outstanding hoppy offering from Hill Farmstead. Solid if not near perfect on all fronts.",0.7250832068119962,4.5,0.9122

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Really dug the appearance on this one, benchmark for style kind of stuff. Bright yellow, chunky cloudiness, pristine 3/4"" white head. Aroma gives you those health food store wheatgrass citrusy lemon precursors on top of grain.  All of that comes out in the taste. Pretty full bodied mouthfeel kind of stuff. The format 500ml is a little expensive compared to 12oz offerings, but this is some pretty good benchmark for the hefeweizen style. The yeast isnt overly banana or spice rack laden either.",0.71162143157755,3.75,0.9118
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Lou Pepe Framboise '11 Vintage  Pours a very saturated, burgundy red color, with a soon disappating, fizzy head.   Exhibit a fantastic smelling nose, with a very pronounced raspberry presence, blending perfectly into the tart acidity of the beer, establishing a reminiscence of young berries and young, fermented wine. Barnyard funk mingles together with prickly raspberry stones, tied together by a sweet, fruity undertone, exhibiting a gentle depth to the aromas.   Has a medium carbonation and a very soft mouthfeel, with raspberry at every stage of drinking.  Tastes of unripe raspberries right from the beginning, wrapped up in leaves, moldy earth and tart funk - wild berries on an abandoned road during rain. This changes, as an earthy sweetness adds to the raspberries spending them a ripe note, including prickly, still sour stones. This fruity sweetness then stays on par with the bitterness on the palate till the finish, with the berries exhibiting a dusty earth note anong ripened, slightly fermented raspberry pulp, leaving behind a slick sourness.  The balance between ripe and young, sour raspberries, finding their quintessence in between, makes this beer noteworthy, featuring a lot of subtle Barnyard nuances.",0.6806872739708697,4.25,0.9118

Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour with grain, wine grape, white wine, wood, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour grain, fruit, white wine, and acidic flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with great white wine barrel aged characteristics all around.

Vicinity,"L - more of that delightful OJ haze. A bit darker this time around. Bit of murk, bit of turb. Surprised by how coarse the head bubbles were. This screams overcarbonated, but let's see...  S - less of the piney dank you normally get with Trillium, and more fresh New England citrus. Orange rind, lightly sweet melon, and some pineapple/mango juice.   T - right out of the blocks, this beer screams BALANCE. Nothing punched my gut in, but I was taken aback by how well all the flavors swirled together. Orange peel and pithy grapefruit up front that lazily transitions into cantaloupe and honey dew. There might be some candied peaches in there too. Then back to mealy piney bitterness for the finish. The beer feels very clean and controlled. Crisp, but enough leeway to let the juice work its way throughout my palate.   F - I was wrong about the carbonation! Quite the opposite actually. Low low carbonation for an incredibly smooth and stealthy mouthfeel. Sneaks across my tongue and drizzles onto my teeth and pools between my gums and cheeks. Light enough to keep my hand on the glass, ready to take another sip.   O - one of the more impressive Trillium beers. This ain't the out of control flavor bomb Headroom is or the drinkable, well-done Fort Point, but rather a happy medium. Again, emphasis on the balance.

Sip Of Sunshine,"This is my favorite readily available (sort of ...) IPA. Living in MA, it's easy to find locally if you find out what day the distributor makes a drop off at your local liquor store. As a hater of juicy IPA beers, I like the lemon and resin combination of this. It has to be fresh and cold ... if its warm or even lukewarm it can be as harsh as lemon pledge. However, ice cold, there isn't another beer I crave as much.  It also packs a punch ... one can and I am feeling light and fuzzy. It's a great sipping beer with a mouthfeel on the light side. The smell is nothing to write home about ... it is yeasty smelling with a hint of juniper. The taste is much, much better.  I am so glad this is getting easier to find in cans. On draft, its still a bit of a unicorn outside Vermont or Hartford. The price is rising along with its availability but it's worth it for such a fresh tasting and finely blended smooth beer. I'll always try to keep a 4 pack in the fridge.",0.6348872582755369,5.0,0.9117

Sip Of Sunshine,picked up 3 cases and poured one into a pint glass. Poured a bright orange with a modest creamy head that dissipated to less than an eighth of an inch quickly. The smell is an awesome tropical pine. The taste is a well balanced tropical hop bomb with hints of tropical sweetness and bitter pine that could not be any better balanced.

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"From notes taken 06/14/17:  Very clear golden amber yellow with sparse and fine haze. Second pour though a marbled, mottled, variegated, swirly, murky work of art. Different shades and densities and finenesses and depths, heavier and darker toward the bulb of this Weizen glass, with speckles hear and there of larger chunks clinging to the inner walls of the glass. Pillowy, long-lasting bright off-white head of creamy fluff. Clearly a filtered Hefe. Banana and yeast aromas, both strong, and enough in balance to where determining where one begins and the other ends is pointless. Even more banana-forward, not quit bubblegum to taste. Sloshing around yields a rich, bready, and almost savory yeast character. Finish has a light metallic tartness but not enough to disrupt the balance. Light-bodied with very active and slightly tingly but very soft and squishy suds. Semi-astringent.",0.7091525199654269,4.0,0.9116
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2006 vintage  A - a solid dark magenta that fades to a watermelon pink around the edges when held to light. tiny white head composed of large bubbles that recede very quickly into a ring at the side of the glass  S - Strong sour, old fruits: very tart raspberries, with grapefruit and grapes in the back.   T - Tart raspberry, grapefruit, and black currant are at the forefront, almost overwhelmingly so. The sour funk is the most violent flavor of this delicious brew, with almost zero booziness. the tartness mellows some as this concoction warms, bringing out softer citrus flavors like strawberry and even a bit of sweet melon.   M - very light, slides back nicely. Perhaps a little undercarbonated.   D - Not a session beer, but interesting and worth revisiting occasionally.",0.6806949297969619,4.0,0.9116
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"750ml bottle dated October 17, 2008.  Pours a deep murky cranberry with a short-lived fizzy pink head that recedes immediately and leaves no lacing.  Aroma is full of tart cherries and a little bit of brown sugar. There is a hefty lactic acid component alongside more subtle oak and brett notes.  The cherries are also big up front on palate but are immediately swept away by the oaky tannins and earthy funk. The sugar and cherries are still there but the tartness is a little more pronounced.  The mouthfeel is dry, almost feels like a wine on the palate with the fruity tartness and oak mixing together.  This is a fantastic beer and one that I have taken for granted as it sits on the shelf while the Cnatillon flies off next to it. Big fan.",0.6657812066130145,4.5,0.9115
Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,"So there were, what, four or five weeks on Beer Advocate where everyone was posting trades for Appervation, right? I sure hope all of those traders were happy with what they received. I ended up receiving my bottle in a slightly unplanned way - I hadn't been in to the hype, but was still pleased to locate and try a bottle.  But, cautious. I was skeptical of the hype and didn't want to be disappointed. I've been hurt too many times in the past!  I made the mistake of giving this one a shot when it was still too cold. The carbonation was practically non-existent - only the tiniest little foaming tipped me off that the bottle hadn't gone bad. Relief! The alcohol notes are definitely a bit unpleasant when the beer is still cold - it's probably the worst example I've found recently of how stouts are very temperature-sensitive. But, after it warms up - the chocolate and bourbon come alive. The alcohol remains strongly in the nose, taste, and mouth feel, but the flavors open up wonderfully.  Appervation is quite good - but, in all honesty, I'd have traded mine in a moment for another bottle of Double Barrel Dark Apparition.",0.5834047160893485,4.5,0.9115
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"More than lucky to be able to split a bottle of this with their own brewmaster!

Juicy,"First pour displays a slight chill haze, yet still allows for a sparkling amber body with a thin creamy white head that fades to a film with a creamy ring and some rolling hills of lace. The full pour yields full haze.  Smell is divine. Simple yet complex. Apple, pear, white wine oak, a hint of light aged cheese funk, and sharp passionfruit.  Juicy starts smooth and round on the palate with some soft carbonation, a crisp tart middle, and a sharp, tart, tingly, semi-dry finish...but what are these flavors? Seriously! It's so well-made and integrated it's a challenge identifying descriptors. Pear. Passionfruit. Nelson-like hops. Crisp, tart tangerine. White wine oak. It's champagne-esque, but also nearing balsamic territory. Kiwi! All kept anchored by some bitter grapefruit rind.  A very good beer, but definitely not the absolute stunner I was led to believe it to be. I would probably put some effort into obtaining another at one point, but actually the beer I had the day before, a similar but local BottleHouse En Foret, impressed me much more, although, it did have added fruit.",0.7000537731816379,4.0,0.9113

T: Ok, I tasted the bourbon at first and it was smooth, but after going back and forth between this and the vanilla DL I developed this Graham cracker taste which complemented the vanilla's marshmallow flavor, unreal!

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Finally getting around to reviewing my notes from DLD. Had on tap of course!  A- Pours a thick dark motor oil black color. I held this up to the light and it had no accent to it at all....just dark black. It had about a half finger mocha/tan head that wasn't very impressive and went down rather quickly. Lacing was sticky on the sides of the glass but I think regular DL beats this one out in the appearance catagory.  S- This has the same highlights as the DL with the coffee and chocolate I think dominating along with some darker fruits and something else I can't place my finger on. Some distinct oak and bourbony undertones come and go when I sniff at this along with faint vanillia aromas as well. This beer is making my mouth water just smelling it.  T- Big oaky...bourbon taste right upfront that powers with the chocolate and coffee taste of the DL. The balance is maybe a little off but that is only opinion. I get hints of the vanillia blending almost perfect with a brown sugar taste I get. This beer is big and it knows it. A heavy hitter with different tastes around every turn. Can taste the alcohol a little more with this one.  M- This is a heavy hitting mouthfeel. Not a huge carbonation leaves this beer knocking on your palate until you force it to leave. Leaves a nice amount oaky, coffee, chocolate taste on the tounge. This beer feels good in the mouth still after being so big and heavy.  D- This beer is sadly for me a one beer and move onto the next for me. It is good but so damn heavy that it feels like I'm drinking a meal. Plus there was two other DL's I had to try while I was talking with friends.",0.6286866866151494,4.5,0.9111

Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"375mL 2017 edition poured into a snifter A: Pitch black with a thin head that lingers S: Freshly brewed espresso, cocoa, vanilla, roasted malt, some toffee/molasses... very full and complex T: Matches the nose note for note. Just tons going on, all of it delicious. Coffee up front followed by all the complexities of a well made barrel aged stout M: Full-bodied, big without being boozy O: This is one to sip slowly and savor. Just everything about it is well-made, completely worthy of the outstanding rating it has",0.6589844630041266,4.5,0.9109
Nelson,"pours a gorgeous golden hazy color with foamy head that dissipates moderately. smell is very tropical: mangoes, peaches, citrus, ripe everything. very little malt smell, maybe a sweet fruity one. taste is underwhelming when compared to smell. you get that tropical taste, but there are also grassy notes and a big rye background. maybe I'm just not a fan of rye. taste gets even more mild as the beer warms. mouthfeel is very appropriate for taste, holds it all together. overall a very good beer, would definitely get again, despite high prices for a bomber.",0.6812092194592243,4.25,0.9108
Green,"Pours like OJ (typical). Almost 0% transparency. Beautiful golden hue. Nose is tropical. Pineapple and orange stand out. Followed by some light earthy undertones and a light to moderate maltiness.  Taste follows the nose almost exactly. It is a unique profile for an IPA. The combination of flavors is like tropical cucumber melon - if you will.  MF is on point. Expertly balanced. So velvety smooth. On par with the other Tree House heavyweights (King J, Juice Machine, etc.) One of my favorite IPA's. One worth seeking out that is semi-regularly available, relatively speaking.",0.7184617211840044,4.75,0.9107
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"2014 vintage. Poured into a stout snifter. Dark black/brown with thick creamy brown head that sticks around with healthy lacing. Exquisite smelling beer-sweet roasty chocolate with strong barrel presence. Tastes great too-bold sweet chocolate notes, backed by boozy barrel flavor that comes with a mild tang. Only complaint is the slight thin feel to it, but otherwise, this is an outstanding barrel aged stout. Update on 10/27/18: 2016 vintage would rate slightly lower.",0.6631052829794117,4.75,0.9107
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2013 sticker at Hopyard in Oslo. This was a pleasant surprise and a real treat. My first time having LPF and I think I rank it best among the framboise that I have had - I prefer it to Framboise du Fermier and Atrial. It is very balanced - pleasantly tart, not super sour.",0.6003361325820729,4.5,0.9106
Mastermind,"Wow!!!! This beer is right up there with Heady Topper and my fav Abner from Hill Farmstead Brewery. I live in NY and it is at a minimum 2.5 hours away to get any of the fabulous VT beers.

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2012 sticker. 3/23/15 bottling. Birthday bottle!  L: Lovely deep red and pink hue. Very slightly pink, mostly white head to a ring.  S: This is intoxicating. Raspberry jam. Hint of funk.  T: Pretty incredible. So jammy. Slight points off for as it warmed I got a bit of a cheesy character.  F: Classic Cantillon. Light and effervescent, mildly creamy.  O: Definitely met my expectations. I'd love to see where this beer goes with some age on it.",0.6049536925755661,4.5,0.9105
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Big upgrade over original Dorothy in my opinion. The wine barrel add so much complexity, and this was perfectly carbonated as well. Not a lot of bells and whistles with adjuncts and or fruit being added, just a beautiful barrel-aged Saison.",0.6359260745632754,4.75,0.91
Nelson,"Soft golden and hazy with moderate carbonation and a finger of off white head.  Smells of real dank, earthy citrus, like hop oil. Almost like a gueuze, with a gravel like scent.  The taste follows the nose with the really unique, hop resin, gravel, asphalt, earthy, stone like quality which is dank and has a hint of citrus, but isn't really fruity.  Medium, somewhat pulpy body, with moderate, soda like carbonation.  Had this one ordered online, drinking in my home, Dec 12th, 2018. So different and unique. Reminds me of a Belgian gueuze meets west coast IPA, though not through sourness, but other gravel earthy qualities. Looks like an North East IPA, taste like a West Coast IPA, sort of.",0.6595102290975811,4.0,0.91
Black Tuesday,This was a great pour. Poured a dark black color. Lots of Bourbon in the nose and it follows in the taste. Lots of great bourbon taste. The mouth feel is to me a little thin. For a beer this big I would like a little thicker mouthfeel. But it is still a great beer.,0.6095269308711472,4.5,0.91
Enjoy By IPA,"A fantastic IPA from Stone, with a wonderful hops profile. I'm guessing the West Coast-style cascade strain is in here. Good citrus that don't overdo it on grapefruit flavors like some others.",0.6455328269036813,4.0,0.91
Chocolate Rain,"a 2013 bottle.  Appearance: Black as sin, no light whatsoever comes through. There is a thin tan head that I cant believe is there.   Nose: Big notes of chocolate, and bitter dark chocolate. Smells amazing. Light astrigency from the alchohol but that is to be expected with this abv.  Taste: This thing is just dripping with a sweet milk chocolate flavor, if I could make hot cocoa from this I would. This is a big beer but you cant taste any alchohol at all. There is a slight warming in the chest, but it never comes through in the taste.   Mouthfeel: This has one of the thickest mouthfeels I have ever had, there is a slight sweet film left on my teeth.   overall this didnt dissapoint as so many of the whales have been for me. glad I was able to get this.",0.6106738308816199,4.5,0.91
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Absolutely incredible. I've been very critical of Jackie Os in the past. BUT , this beer is every bit as good as GVNP batch 2 and Ba Abraxas.

Scaled Up,"Bottled on 1/8/16, consumed tonight, 1/30/16. 750mL bottle poured into a tulip as usual. Again, Thanks for picking these up Ryan !  A: Murky / almost turbid appearance. Typical yellowish color. Heads leaves quickly to just a paper thin cap. This is gonna be another juice bomb from Trill and I can't F'n wait !!  S: As I cracked the cap on this, once again there was a citrusy hop slap in my grill. There's pinnapple, a touch of peach, or maybe orange. I could smell this and the DDH Sclaled All damn day!  T : Juice Bommmmbs away ! Lol these guys are REDICULOUSLY on pointe. So I get pinnapple for sure, some orange or peach. Dank weed, and just a touch of smooth sweet malts toward the ass end.   F : A nice clean, slightly thin feel as you swallow. With a nice hop bitterness bite that doesn't linger very long.  O: From what I hear batch 1 was decent, but this batch has been tweaked, and it's glorious. I compare this to their recently release Double Dry Hopped Scaled. It's got more booze, but that's what it reminds me of. So if you haven't had any of Trilliums offerings, I urge you to pick some up, your scences will thank you ! Bravo Trillium Crew, keep kicking ass.  Cheers !",0.5884587769484699,4.5,0.9099
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Has a deep straw look and a bit murky, and a wild, large white head that is still good after sitting a few minutes. Great banana and clove as expected, and are just right. Low bitterness, malty, and nice and smooth with a good level of carbonation. Really enjoyed drinking this beer.",0.6837508457845988,4.25,0.9099
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Really interesting beer, has Big, bold, roasty, malt flavors one excepts from a BA stout such as chocolate and coffee, as well as an equal dose of raisins, caramel and vanilla, to almost comes off as a cross between a barley wine and a stout. Seriously awesome beer.",0.614511562665917,4.5,0.9099
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Pours a hazy gold with a small head gathering a fine lace. The smell very slight, with floral notes. The taste is extremely tame with almost no aftertaste. Not a ton of hops present but certainly finely balanced. Body is smooth and goes down easy and is overall a teuly refreshing hefeweiss. I'd enjoy this in the spring or summer, possibly at room temp to bring out those darker, sweeter profiles!",0.7053922353536216,4.0,0.9098
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"2014 bottle poured into a snifter.  Pours pitch black with a dark mocha colored head that is less than a finger high. No lacing and the head vanishes almost immediately leaving a small ring of foam around the glass.  Aromas of sweet bourbon, vanilla, maple, and a nutty hazelnut type of smell.   Taste is awesome! Enormous bourbon and vanilla up front. Roasted malt, chocolate, hazelnut. The maple definitely is there but is subdued probably due to the age.  Really smooth and creamy. Not overly viscous or thick. Extremely mellow from the 3+ years of age.   Overall this was an excellent offering! My second beer from Jackie Os, with the first also being a stout, and I think they hit it out of the park with both.",0.6518178599179124,4.5,0.9097
Todd The Axe Man,First beer from Surly!  Pour is a nice glowing orange with very little head going on. Not many bubbles and hardly any lacing.  Smell is of citrus pine and grassy lemon and tropical fruits.  Taste is very similar to smell. An aggressive bitter and dank taste is at the forefront combined with more citrus / lemon and it has a tangerine quality to it. A nice creamsicle vanilla flavor seems to be there also.  Full bodied and not overly carbonated. Fairly easy drinker.  Overall a very nice beer. This had just over a month of age on it and it still was insanely good. Well done Surly!,0.6850869675818709,4.5,0.9097
Nelson,"Fresh bottle best by 6/18/16.  Very impressive showcase of Nelson Sauvin, this beer is balanced by depth of flavor and lightness on the palate. The nose is pungent with fresh orange rind and pine resin. On the tongue is juicy orange, bitter grapefruit pith and a touch of resinous pine. The malt backbone is extremely light - just the way I like an IPA - but with that slightly spicy rye kick. So nice. The mouthfeel is light and pillowy with light, prickly carbonation. This beer drinks so easy, which is a shame because my 22 oz bottle kicked very quickly.",0.7041035587379486,4.5,0.9097
Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,light gold in color. White head.   A very nice saison beer. Oaky and fruity. Herbal. Lemony. Tropical fruit blend. Earthy. Spice notes.

Todd The Axe Man,"It's pretty fucking dank, but that 99 rating is a little off. Clearly, the modern ipa has progressed quickly, but this is still a very solid brew. Would drink again. Clean hop profile that doesn't move to heavily into any specific hop character, more of a solid blend.",0.6608044413339105,4.25,0.9093
Coconut B-Bomb,"22 oz bottle- Pours black with a medium tan head. Aroma is malt balls, milk duds, coconut, oak, creamy, very FW barrel in aroma. The taste is strong in coconut, chocolate, a touch of spice, molasses, leather. So creamy and delicious. One of the best beers I have had in a long time.",0.6138641118746533,4.75,0.9093
Sang Noir,"A: Pours a deep, dark red with a fingers worth of head that lingers for a bit  S: Lots of cherry and oak initially. I got hints of the bourbon and vinous wine notes with some lighter tart notes. Very lightly sweet as well, most likely from the vanilla notes from the bourbon barrels  T: Starts off with some moderate tartness that is balanced out by the oak bourbon and cherries. This is absolutely magnificent to drink. Each sip left me wanting more.   M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation  O: A very complex and intricate beer that touches on everything the label states. Subtle bourbon and oaky notes finish with cherries and tartness. Absolutely fantastic and one of those beer that I'll remember the experience for quite some time.",0.6807211671999175,4.75,0.9093
Nectarine Premiere,"Pours a hazy yellow color with only a few fuzzy bubbles on the surface. Aroma is fresh, unripened nectarines, grapefruit pearl, lemon, and fresh oak, and some granny smith apple. Taste is like biting into a fresh nectarine that is more tart than juicy. There's a little acetic acid and band aid as is common with De Garde. It has a full flavor while maintaining a light airy freshness throughout. I get a rich, white wine note as it warms along with grapefruit pith and sour lemon candy. Carbonation is minimal but just enough to move the beer along. It's very esay to drink the 750 in one sitting. This is a fantastic beer.",0.6706450413610304,4.75,0.9091
Sip Of Sunshine,A: About 1.5 fingers' worth of head. Body is a murky orange color. Not much lacing going on but the head stays around while drinking.   S: Lots of piney smells coming from the beer. Few fruit like flavors are picked up but mostly pine-like hops are being picked up.   T: Taste doesn't exactly match the smells. Picking up more fruit flavors than the pine-like flavors. The pine outdoorsy flavors are there but take a backseat.   M: Beer has a thick mouthfeel for an IPA. Covers my tongue well. Smooth drinker that goes down easy.   O: Been looking for this one for a good while. It was worth the wait. One of the top IPAs that I have had in a while.,0.6296889692435526,4.5,0.9091
Enjoy By IPA,"Bottled 3/14/17, enjoy by date 4/21/17, actually enjoyed on 4/25/17. Poured into an oversize wine glass. Pours clear golden without much haze, no sediment. A 1-inch foamy head that dissipated fairly quickly. Smell is of fresh and pungent hops strong in grapefruit rind, citrus, tangerine, some peach, and a little bit of spice (clove?) and pine. Taste follows the nose and is more citrusy up front, then mid-palate has some grapefruit and other fruits with a combination of bitterness and sweetness, and there is a resinous and oily quality whereby it crawls into every part of the mouth supplying different notes in different places. Feels fairly full bodied with low carbonation. Sharply bitter in the back of the throat and finishes dry but doesn't linger too much, and somehow invites another gulp. Incredibly drinkable at 9.4% alcohol. I loved it.",0.6969628118106043,4.5,0.9089
Chocolate Rain,"Bottle shared at Woodshop 7 at Beachwood BBQ in Long Beach. Thanks to whoever busted this one out. Pours dark brown with a filmy tan head.

Aroma- TANGERINE! citrus, juicy (smells juicy), lost of fruit ester going on, Piney, Spicy, catty ammonia, and lots of hops  Taste- Started mild due to the temperature of the pour, smooth and easy bitters. as it warmed it became very earthy, dry, piney, dominated by tangerine and fruity juicy palate, nectar  Aftertaste- SO DRY, i liked that. Crisp, malty smooth, almost had a faint sweetness, assertive alcohol presence as it warmed  Mouthfeel- Clean, medium body, medium carbonation, clean, but unfiltered lingering flavors  Overall- Holy DIPA! Intense ale not for the faint of heart or beginner craft beer consumer. Alcohol and fruit flavors overwhelm the palate especially as it warms.",0.7019535499956875,4.0,0.9088
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"This ones been in the cellar a while. Went through a bit of a thing with stouts. We've since made up so lets do this. 2013 bottle. Big thank you to wordemupg!  Black, very little brown head. Nice nose with plenty of bourbon and vanilla.a little black licorice and chocolate.

Vicinity,"Trillium doesn't disappoint. 16oz can poured into a tulip. $20 for 4pack at the brewery. Look: Hazy orange leaning towards yellow. Not their haziest but still opaque. Smell: Dry citrus. Citra hops come through big. Taste: Citrus all day. Some floral aspects, maybe a touch of grass.  Feel: Light body for a DIPA at 8%. Nice carbonation.  Overall: Fantastic DIPA and one of the top I've had. Would drink again in a heartbeat.",0.6576847693689728,4.75,0.9087
Sang Noir,"Appearance- Only a sliver of head which seems as if it would have been a light beige or off-white. The body is a muddy brown which has hints of purple. Light bourbon color when held up to the light. Some sheeting is left behind.  Nose- Lots of bourbon with hints of Pinot Noir. Fairly subdued when it comes to any sour notes. There is a little bit of grape, some cherry. The bourbon, however, is complex enough to make up for the lack of presence from the esters and lactic acid.  Taste- Kicks in where the nose fails. There are very dominant sour notes: cherry, strawberry, and tart apple are in the forefront. Linger includes bourbon (by far the non-sour note with the most presence), straw, slight funk that suggest ripe, stinky cheese, some grass, and light notes of Pinot Noir grapes. As it opens up, the funk of the flavor profile shows more and more presence. The bourbon begins to fade and the lactic acid and the Brett begin to take over. Lots of stone fruits- peach, apricot, and cherry. Very nice dry finish that is almost crisp.  Mouthfeel- Light bodied with a large amount of syrup to the texture. Nice amount of carbonation which fits the style. If it were effervescent in the vein of a Russian River or Cantillon, this would be incredible. There is a slight tingle.  Drinkability- Very easygoing. Aging has made this a very accessible at this point in time. Four bucks for a 3 ounce pour is kind of steep but still reasonable for a one time taste.  Overall- Very good to almost great. Solid sour that is a must for sour fans",0.6953693307406472,4.25,0.9086
Beer:Barrel:Time,"L: pours super thick and pitch black pour with no head. A film ring around the glass when swirled. S: bakers chocolate and fudge, slight smoke and slight barrel.  T: the bakers chocolate (powder / dry thing) and fudge are in perfect balance with the barrel. The barrel shines throughout the finish with loads of smooth and deep rich Bourbon slight warming. This is definitely not ""hot"" and it's 15%.  F: thick as motor oil, stains my glass, sticks to me teeth, ultra smooth. I can't emphasize the smoothness and thickness of this beer. Absolutely stunning this is 15%.  O: incredible.",0.6223248294093473,5.0,0.9086
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Had a 2015 vintage  Honestly expected more raspberry in the taste and nose. As the Cantillon employee said it was their finest lambic with not 200 grams, but 300 grams of raspberry per liter Lou pepe.  Nevertheless still a great beer. Cantillon does not have any bad beers",0.5630344072511237,4.5,0.9086
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Excellent! One of if not the best stouts this year, and all time. Elegant, rich, smooth, flavorful. $6.50/single but carries its weight in value compared to everything else out there. Not a big fan of ""Russian"" Imperial Stouts but this hangs with BCBS, KBS, ... the great regular stouts! A+",0.6354994162902474,4.75,0.9083
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"This is my kinda stout. Poured jet black with a mocha head that leaves some bubbles behind. Aroma is chocolate fudge and subtle bourbon and oak.

Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Bottling Date: April 28, 2010   Appearance: Slightly cloudy Violet-yellow color. Moderate light violet head that dissipated fairly quickly.  Smell: Mild funk and tart cherries.  Taste: Tart cherries come across upfront with a mild splash of funk. A healthy dose of genuine sour cherries comes across strongly. The tart cherries feature prominently in the finish. I also get a bit of leather notes.  Mouth-feel: Medium-bodied (for a lambic/wild ale) with a moderate level of carbonation which results in a satisfying mouthful.  Overall: It would be nice if I hated this, because it's pricey and something I can't justify buying often. No dice, it has a good flavor profile, the cherry notes come off as genuine not artificial, it looks good, and it has a pleasing mouth-feel.",0.6895749791426251,4.5,0.9081
Swish,What a great beer. Lot of bitter and sweet at the same time. Smells like a trillium. Leaves a hint of bitter aftertaste. Different from the other bissel offerings; better. I wish this was easier to get.,0.6128490903621698,4.75,0.9081
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Intense Red sampled during the RBWG-2014 in Asheville.   Brilliant ruby red color; clear, with a thin, semi-durable, top coat.  Aroma: Moderately funky; slightly fruity.

Fairly intense, as promised.",0.7302407187241522,4.75,0.9081

Haze,"Can (one off from De Bierkoning) @ home. Murky yellow (mustard) colour. Firm white head with just a little retention. Aroma's of dank hops, onion, citrus.

Long finish with dank hops and a great burp. Lovely stuff!",0.6645740072964046,4.25,0.9081
Black Tuesday,"A Pitch black pour with almost no head. Slightly bubbly.  S: Bourbon, dark fruit, roasted malt, caramel notes. T: Bourbon upfront for sure, gotta let it sit in your mouth for all the other flavors to come out. Some caramel, dark fruit that I can't pin down, and surprisingly little alcohol burn considering the ABV.  M: Thick mouth feel which probably hides the alcohol well, low/medium carbonation O: Simply excellent. All of the flavors come out one by one and the aftertaste is very pleasant as well. This beer is a sipper for sure, but one of the best I've had in a long time.",0.6476175777255392,4.75,0.9081
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Love the lime feel on this. Poured from a 32 oz growler into an IPA glass. Really great beer all around.

Mastermind,"Had fresh out of the can at Fiddlehead (well technically the pizza place next door after buying it). Served in a pint glass it's a touch hazy honey gold color with a fluffy head.  Sweet aroma on this, somewhat hoppy, bit malty. Flavor wise there's a pretty sizeable malt bill first, some fruit, tropical hops, bit of honey, then a sweet finish. Overall a nice DIPA but not as good as many others from VT. Fresh Fiddlehead IPA was actually a few notches better than this batch.",0.6844095324973524,4.0,0.908

Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"16 oz can split into two El Cat tulips with Lisa - thanks to (the legendary home brewer) Rob F for grabbing this for us. Bright orange, hazy color.

Nelson,"Bottle with bb date of March 2016 poured into a Teku. Look is a hazy light orange with lots of lacing. Smell is fantastic with dank earthy onion/garlic, grapefruit and tangerine. Taste follows suit with the nose and has a great earthy white wine flavor after the initial citrus. Can definetaly taste the rye too as a slight peppery malt finish. Feel is a tad thin but not bad for an IPA with medium carbonation and slick oily resin. If Green Flash brews aren't as good as the original Alpine, as I've read, the original Nelson must be killer cause this is pretty fantastic as is.",0.6800655592445207,4.5,0.9075
Juicy,"Amber in color with a tropical fruit nose. Smells super, wait for it...juicy. Taste follows the nose. Very fruity and tropical hops with flavors of mango and papaya mixed with clean crackery malt undertones and slight vinous wine barrel. Very slight acidity. Very floral as well. Juicy, tropical and floral overall. Medium body, tingly carb, smooth, chewy, mouthfeel that's lightly greasy with a surprisingly solid bitterness. This beer is still going strong.",0.7074061325267313,4.5,0.9074
Nelson,Golden straw. You can really smell the malt bill in this beer which is really supportive of the hops. Hops don't give off a ton of nose but they do taste of pine and grapefruit rind. Mouthfeel is great. The rye really finishes clean.,0.6413744827619301,4.5,0.9074
Chocolate Rain,"Poured from 2012 bomber into snifter glass. Poured dark brown with a mild mannered khaki head; the retention was light, with a non-existant lacing. The nose picked up some cocoa, vanilla, molasses, caramel, and paramount bourbon. The flavor profile was really impressive out of the gate. It wasn’t initially boozy, but it was very heavy on the cocoa nibs and vanilla. However, the booze hit quite hard in the back finish which pretty much dominated the rest of my drinking session. The malt profile was dominant throughout – more caramel, molasses, cocoa nibs, vanilla, dark fruits, biscuits, and some more booziness. Sticky mouthfeel with a thin to medium presence. Unfortunately, the booze took over the pleasant aromas and flavors which were much appreciated initially.",0.6573620162098717,4.0,0.9073
Black Tuesday,"A must-try, just make sure you have someone/s to share it with! Had the 2012 on 11/14/14  After having had the 2014 recently, I'll add that the aging really cut through the heat for me and made this a really enjoyable beer. Love it fresh too, it's just a lot.",0.5369748738377486,5.0,0.9073
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"such a great beer, I had heard the hype before I tried it and it lived up to that hype.  Very fruity, nice purplish color, taste of raspberries, nice tartness to it as well.",0.6152545611704556,5.0,0.9073
Todd The Axe Man,A fantastic juicy IPA. Canned a little over a month ago but still very fresh. I could tell the moment I poured it in my glass that it was going to be great as I smelled the hops right away. Citrus was the dominant flavor. The way this beer tasted is what I look for in every IPA I drink but few are able to be up to this standard.,0.5990223144196863,4.25,0.907
Sip Of Sunshine,Poured a wonderful golden color with a white one finger head. Solid lacing with little residual.  The smell of flowers and citrus (orange to be exact” overwhelmingly dominated the nose.  Fantastic feel in my mouth. Very smooth for a beer that is 8% Alc.  A top notch beer! Maybe a bit overhyped but great nonetheless!,0.6584869684363819,4.0,0.9069
Dragonsaddle,"Absolutely blown away that this is considered a ""triple ipa.""  I personally don't recognize the style ""triple ipa"" . . . However, what I have had that advertises as such has been hard to finish. Usually just way to harsh in every facet. Along comes Hoof Hearted'so take on the style. Hoof Hearted has crafted a very well done example of a high abv% beer bursting with great flavor and aroma. Wouldn't want to drink more than one in a sitting but the one is a real treat. I May or may not ever get the chance to try Pliney the younger, but if I do, Hoof Hearted's Dragon Saddle and Columbus's Creeper have set the bar pretty high.",0.6060817280804328,4.5,0.9069
Society & Solitude #4,"A - Pours a hazy tan/light to medium orange in color with a light head that dies quickly to an even white lacing ring, mellow carbonation.  S - Big aromatic nose that wreaks of big ripe juicy mango, pineapple, sweet grapefruit, all resinous and drowns out the malt base. There's also an alcohol effervescence that's noticeable.  T - Matches up with the nose: Lots of resin and tropical fruit oils with a pepper spice - sweet ruby grapefruit bitterness, mango, bitter oranges, and is hop forward but as the glass warms up the light malt comes through a little more to help balance things out.   M - Light medium body and leaves a bitter sweet peppery grapefruit finish that lingers for many minutes.   O - Another great IPA from Hill Farmstead.",0.6719239525001329,4.5,0.9066
Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"L: cross between white and pale, good haze level, white head which dissipates quickly  S: tartness, bit of funk, some fresh lemon  T: crisp and bright, good refined lemony tartness, mild funk  F: crisp with some bite  O: very nice and refreshing offering from SARA, definitely will buy again!",0.7082750662145019,4.5,0.9066
Beatification,"Beatification batch 5  Pours a filtered, light yellow color and a fizzy, bubbly head, immediately dissapearing into small sheets of lacing.  Lower carbonated, with a very refreshing mouthfeel to it, due to fresh lemons and a balancing, wooden oak infusion.   The aromas unfold just after popping open the bottle, filling the air in my room with a lovely, citrussy funkiness. Reveals even more ripe, juicy citrus when smelling at the actual beer, together with an immense tartness, bedded on glue, yogurt and old leather. Creates an interesting interplay between dough, soft old malts and prickly, crisp lemon, without becoming intriguingly complex.  The taste offers a good amount of lemon right from the very beginning, accompanied by easing, bready, musty malts and fermented wheat. Lemons get increasingly more body added, resulting in a very sour, funky tartness, almost numbing the front of my tongue during its peak. Finishes fruity, with fresh pressed lemons, revealing even lemon stones, as for how pronounced the fruit acidity gets, offering an acceptable dryness.   The balancing oaky barrel vanishes completely during the beers finish, opening the palate up to pure, sour fruit lemonade. Hammers a bit too hard on the palate, regarding its acidic sourness, preventing the beer from showcasing its other, more subdued flavors.",0.7248368904795082,3.0,0.9065
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Poured from a 500ML bottle to a cheap clear glass. Golden yellow with a slight haze, extremely dense head that dissipates to about 1/4 inch that resembles whipped cream. (amazing) Very complex flavors, wheat and grain upfront, followed by a slight sweetness and then a hint of cloves.(similar to Hoegarden but not nearly as assertive) The 1/4 inch whipped cream head lasted the entire glass. I don't know if this is bottle conditioned but it also had a small layer of sediment in the bottom of the bottle. Really special, glad I found it.",0.6537646071268512,4.5,0.9063
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Pours solid black and thick. Smell is an amazing mix of the bourbon, malts, chocolate and a touch of caramel. The taste is equally striking - a balance of the initial bourbon followed by the roasted malts, chocolate and caramel with a hint of vanilla. A full-bodied stout though based on the pour, I thought it would be thicker. A nice clean finish. An incredible stout.",0.6609308781237095,4.5,0.9062
Sure Bet,"Pours a hazy golden orange. Nice white foamy head about an inch and a half on an aggressive pour. Smell has a lot of citrus notes with notes of Mango, lemon, pinepapple, and grapefruit. Taste follows suit, nice mango sweetness upfront with a nice tart lemon and grapefruit taste that follows. Finish is a subtle hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is light and juicy. Overall this is an outstanding beer. Juicy and balanced. Pipeworks is a force to be reckoned with.",0.6914970826564072,4.5,0.9062
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"Pours a dark brown color, with a small, soon disappearing dark brown lacing.  Offers a plethora of flavors, mainly coconut, caramel coated vanilla and sweet maple syrup, balanced by earthy malts and bakers chocolate.   Low on its carbonation, with a thinner mouthfeel to it, gently balancing the Bourbon with a silk layer of cream.  Tastes of milk chocolate, cloying molasses, cocoa nibs and earth. Bourbon, soothed by cream, becomes apparent by a dry coconut alcohol bite, revealing bitter chocolate and rock sugar. Finishes with caramel and a slightly bittercoffee earthiness, featuring a pleasant, sugar coated dryness.  Relying heavily on the barrel, this reveals a lot of awesome Bourbon characteristics among sweeter malts, balanced by a bitter dryness. A little thin as for its mouthfeel, while providing a great creaminess.",0.6782930111658434,4.0,0.9062
Dragonsaddle,"This is the upper echelon of of triple IPA’s. The aroma is full of citrus fruit and tropical notes, coming at my nose with waves of dank hops, lots of grapefruit, tangerine and sweet grassy notes. Flavor is super juicy and full of citrus with tangerine, mango, guava, pineapple, grapefruit, orange peel, faint lemon zest, some lactose sugar or a creamy essence, then it brings sweet malt, grains, floral notes and graham cracker. It hides the ABV masterfully and is a terrific representation of this style.",0.6584812624307955,4.75,0.9062
Haze,"L-poured from one day old Tree House growler. Pours hazy/opaque--screams dank by sight  S-Dank, hop, floral all rolled into one. Why can't Yankee Candle make this scent?  T-Mirrors smell. Floral notes pepper the palate and leaves a smooth grapefruit finish with zero aftertaste.  F-Hits like a double. Heavy at first but smooth finish gives amnesia about heavy beginning.  O-Simply put a winner. Worth the 1-2 hour wait at brewery for growler. Drink this beer you will not regret it",0.5825984595256505,4.75,0.9062
Beatification,"Bottled 011012  Very light yellow body. Large fine white head. Bit of lace.  Smells almost like farts. This is some serious funk.  Incredibly sour. One of the sourest beers I've ever had. Like, Rodenbach levels of sour. Kinda sticks with you like Warheads.  Pretty fine feel, but it's a bit sticky.  Really sour and good, maybe worth the effort to get it though.",0.6365794118604621,4.0,0.9062
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"great beer, reminded me A LOT of KBS (in a good way) if there was maple to it. Its strong and a touch boozy but not overpoweringly so. Light carbonation, pours black, small khaki head, great nose of bourbon, maple, and chocolate.",0.6284766311657671,4.25,0.9062

Beatification,"This is one of the loveliest beers I have seen in the glass. It looks like champagne. The nose is subtle and slightly funky -- not the strongest part of the beer. Beatification has a deep lemon juiciness that is incredible. It is followed by a well-balanced pucker that doesn't have you reaching for the Tums. The finish is nice and astringent, which is the perfect lead in to the the next sip. Up there with Supplication as the best from Russian River.",0.6597864527994963,5.0,0.9061

Black Tuesday,"Bottled Sep 2013, opened Nov 2013.  A - Black with a cola halo highlight. Bone-white head settles quickly into a thin rim around the edge of the class. Poor retention and low lace.  S - Booze forward nose; Bourbon soaked brownies, dark chocolate, malted milk balls.  T - Whoa. Thick, melted dark chocolate. Brown breads, caramel, almonds, vanilla, oak. Umami; soy sauce and sweet caramelized carrots. Molasses, brown sugar, and bourbon finish.  M - Incredible finish - possibly the best staying power I've ever had in a beer. Full, smooth, creamy frame.  O - An outstanding stout, absolutely worth the hype.",0.6304941246959795,4.75,0.9061
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Pours pretty solidly opaque and sits pitch black in the glass with no lingering head to speak of. Smell is chocolatey, nutty, with a hint of pepper and barrel undertone. Small hints of vanilla and cinnamon as well. Taste is sweet up front with cinnamon chocolate middle and followed with the heat from the pepper as you swallow, Surprisingly spicy. Feels really thin for such a high abv stout. Overall it is pretty good but needs more body to truly make it world class; too thin for such flavor.",0.6848361798108454,4.25,0.9061
Green,"wow everything I was waiting for, yellow yellow grapefruit color murky and cloudy, smell the grapefruit citrus and tangy, taste was incredible, lot's of grapefruit and citrus, feel had the proper carbonation and overall the is outstanding.

Swish,"Exceptionally drinkable beer with a nice body and hop balance. Not as much of the fruit and piny flavors come through as expected, it has a more muted floral scent and flavor. A really good beer that is in sight of the DIPA greats but goes its own way. What it does have over the likes of Heady and Pliny is its evenhanded flavor from start to finish. Could crush a lot of these in a night and be very happy.",0.6899677407346994,4.5,0.9059
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Sparkling clear yellow-gold with a tall bright white foam settling to a persistent blanket with a slight cling at the edges.  Smell is hay, straw, wild herbs and orchard fruits with a touch of toasted oak and a hint of lime rind.  Taste is grassy hay, lemon and apple, with more brett forward funk and bitterness than regular. Tart and crisp with a tingly semi-dry swallow, a touch of woodiness comes out on the exhale. Overall very well balanced and extremely drinkable.  This isn't the drastic transformation from the base that other barrel aged Hill saisons are, and it's barely more tart. Considering Dorothy is a stellar beer in its own right, I'm still very satisfied with this sip of sunlight on this uncharacteristically sunny Northeast Ohio day.",0.6799883201478392,4.25,0.9059
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"I've had this two years in a row in a plastic cup pour. I took some brief notes this year, so here it goes - a lot of this will be complementary to my review of Dark Lord (when I finally get around to reviewing the regular variety). Some of this text is borrowed from my Vanilla-bean review, where appropriate.  A - Think quick-dissolving mocha foam, nice ring of lace, pitch black with a hint of red at the edges. It's about all I expect from a 13% RIS.  S - Oak-barrel, but not the stupid amount I experienced in oak-aged Behemoth. There's also a touch of vanilla and almond that I get from most good barrel-aged brews, plus the cadre of ""regular"" Dark Lord smells. It's different from regular Dark Lord, but not a huge improvement.  T - I found the oak-aging to simplify the taste of Dark Lord in a way that wasn't altogether positive. The oak-aging really brings out the booziness and heat and smooths out a lot of the really interesting flavors from the regular Dark Lord. It's still pretty delicious, but just slightly acerbic.  M - Thick, near milk-shake consistency, with tons of residual stickiness, and low carbonation. This is the way RISes should be down - other brewer's take note.  D - This is a mild step in the wrong direction - takes the least drinkable elements of Dark Lord and amplifies them a little bit. It's hot, palate-beating, and not really much more interesting than the regular variety. Worth trying, but not worth waiting hours in line to try.",0.6449322772680504,3.5,0.9059
Swish,Truly fantastic. Had never heard of his beer or the brewery before going to Portland for a night. Glad I was told about it and was there on a release day. Sad that I only had $20 cash so couldn't get more (the credit line was long).

Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"Had this a few times, I think I'm just not a fan of maple stouts. Overly sweet. Much like derivation 1, heavey sweetness. I like sweet beers but more vanilla than maple I guess. I can see this being a hit for maple lovers tho. Definitely a well made beer I'll be finishing.

Scaled Up,"had this on tap at Five Horses. pretty typical looking trillium. pungent aromas of orange, peach, a bit of peppery dankness. on the palate is pineapple, mango, orange, pine, mango, citrus peel, and hint of bready malts - everything coming together really nicely and the balance is right on point. a bit thinner on the feel than I anticipated, and I think a little bit of booze slips through as a result. overall this is one absolutely delicious beer!!!",0.6942157212447467,4.5,0.9055
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Bottle 656/688. Massive thanks to mulder1010 for sharing. Reviewed from notes.  Dark chocolate, short of jet black, with a modest dark tan head that abates quickly to a resilient collar.  Decent amounts of burnt toast, tarry volatile barrel notes, woody liquorice, vanilla and coconut. Doesn't hint at what's to come.  Unabashedly decadent. Choc-caramel slice, big-time vanilla fudge, chocolate mud cake. Dessert in a glass.  Thick and viscous but super smooth. Zero, repeat zero hint of booze. Unreal.  Utterly transformative barrel-aged treatment of a base beer that I ordinarily don't care for at all. The barrel reins in and smoothes out the sickly excesses of regular Dark Lord brilliantly.",0.6516370158689149,4.5,0.9054
Beatification,"Poured from a 375mL bottle into a Koningshoeven chalice. Bottled on 10 January 2012. 6.00%  A: Light, frothy white head fades quickly. Super-clear and quite pale. Almost like white wine.  S: Excellent yeast -- sharp, funky, sweet, and sour. Full of fruit and tartness and all the excellent aspects I've come to associate with wild yeast, and none of the lesser aspects.  T: Interesting! Fiercely puckery...almost too much so to drink. Like Warheads as a child, this beer makes my jaw socket ache. Still, it's perversely delicious. A touch of vinegariness that I don't particularly enjoy, almost like olive brine, but otherwise quite nice...bright fruit, very wine-like, very dry, and rather acidic. Some lemons. Overall, enjoyable.  M: Your mouth will want to collapse in on itself. Your tongue will tingle. And you will like it. What a beer!  O: Acidic, interesting, sour, and perhaps a touch overrated. Still, a well-made beer that deserves your attention. I would have another.",0.6680211790614207,4.0,0.9053

Space Trace,"Like a liquid mounds bar. The aromas are subtle, but definitely there from the glass. The magic really happens on the palette.

Black Tuesday,"Pours a dark brown, settles into the glass with a deep cola colored body and a surprisingly thick mocha head. Aromas a charred, roasted malts, sugary bourbon and caramel.

Chocolate Rain,"Bottle: Poured a dark brown/black color ale with a small foamy head with minimal retention and some light lacing. Aroma of black chocolates with quite a bit of residual sugar notes. Taste is also dominated by black chocolate notes with loads of residual sugar and a spicy finish. Vanilla notes are more subtle but kind of help smooth some of the rough edges of this beer. Body is about average for style with medium carbonation and warming alcohol can be detected. Big beer or sure that need to be split up between a couple of people, but very enjoyable beer nonetheless.",0.673721698358221,4.0,0.9052
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,poured from a 16oz can into a willi becher pint glass. pours a very dark and oily black. gently poured so a finger’s worth of mocha head. the mocha color stays through the entire pour in the form of a ring around the edges with swirls in the middle. smell is strong chocolate and taste follows smell. this is a chocolate bomb! none of that half-ass coffee smell and taste i get with a lot of TH stouts. feel is full and very well carbonated. this packs a lot of flavor and is quite full on mouthfeel for a little 6.5% stout. been rather down on a lot of their stouts lately so glad to see that this one lives up to the always-present TH hype.,0.6037897124815893,4.5,0.9052

Swish,"Single tallboy can from last weekend's Portland haul.   A - Classic murky fruit juice Bissell pour, very pale dull orange color on this one. 2 fingers of white head to start, a thick ring and some remnants of a cap remain by the end. Tiny lace dots left here and there.  S - Tropical blast. Mango, orange creme savers, fruit punch, bowl of froot loops, strawberry?, just a bit of pine resin and malt presence. Kinda ridiculous amount of pure sweet tropicality but that's okay.  T - Still tons of pulpy tropical juice flavor but more danky pine coming through here makes it a bit more well-rounded than the scent. Also more in the way of sugar cookie and biscuit malt, which makes for a particularly delicious finish.   M - Creamy smooth and kind of a biggish feel, but nothing too out of the ordinary for a 8% DIPA. Carbonation is a bit on the low side, decent bitter kick, a good mix of soft and bitter hop flavors. A touch of alcohol. Average drinkability, it was easy to take my time with a pint to myself.  O - Almost leans towards overly sweet for an IPA, but the tropical fruit flavor coming out of this is really too wondrous to complain about it much. Could use some balance/bittering/mouthfeel tweaks but really quite nice as is.",0.6831089776960898,4.5,0.9043

A blend of whiskey, coffee, dark chocolate, and lots of that good ole molasses sweetness.  Taste is unbelievable. I will have to say, this is probably one of my top 5 favorite beers I've tried, only falling shortly behind Morning Delight. What a pleasure to drink, with a thick creamy chocolate milk taste, with a sweet taste on the back end, and a little bit of fruit on the back end it seems.

Vicinity,"Very hazy bright orange body with a fluffy, off-white head. Aroma is big on citrus; clementines and tangerines, hints of sweet melon and fresh grass. Flavor is bitter with a lot of citrus zest flavor, hints of sweet hard candy. Feel is slick, medium-high carbonation, full bodied.

Society & Solitude #4,"On tap at Arts and Craft Beer Parlor, NYC.  The color is redolent of freshly squeezed orange juice. Turbid in appearance with a layer of chill haze. No significant head, rather, minimal scattered bubbles on the surface, yet, there is lots of lacing throughout. Intense hops driven aroma that highlights a varied bouquet of fruit and pungent herbal hops. In the 1st phase, there are notes of oranges, grapefruit, pear, and papaya. A light cracker malt aroma throughout. In the 2nd phase, herbaceous and dank notes of pine resin and grass.  The taste opens with a soft graham cracker malt sweetness accompanied by juicy notes of alcohol laced tropical, citrus and orchard fruit. Fruity and delicious flavors of grapefruit, orange, papaya, mango, peach and pear throughout. In the middle palate, a developing bitterness adds balance, along with notes of grass, pine resin and herbal dank. Furthermore, although juicy, the palate has dryness. Throughout the drink, the bitterness increases, as does the alcohol spice, to its credit, without booziness.  Medium to full bodied, gently carbonated and with a smooth mouthfeel, due perhaps to the addition of wheat and oats. The finish is dry and resiny with a lingering bitterness.  This is one of those beers in which the taste lingers in both the mouth and in the memory. I really hope to have it again sometime because it was wonderful.",0.6898359676662229,4.75,0.9041

S: lot of lemon citrus and appla were noticeable on the first whiff alongside musty barnyard bretty funk, some acidity, but with twangy character.  T: the lemon citrus accompanied b the apple falvor did help on the sour punch but with bretty musty funk, a touch of pineapple, and acidic accents.  M: the brew was medium in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a citrusy, slight fruity, acidic, sour, and dry finish.

Damn sweet. Chocolaty. Malty. saccharin. Sweetness. And some alcoholic heat. Thinner mouthfeel. Mild to moderate bitterness.  Wow, this beer is not what I expected.

Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Batch three. Tried it in three different glasses – Pipeworks 10 ounce Tales from the Oak, Pipeworks 12 ounce Ninja vs Unicorn, and a majority of it in an oversized wine goblet.

Darkstar November,"2017 vintage.  A: Pours an impenetrable black with a thin ring of light brown head. Minimal but very persistent.  S: Dry oak and bourbon forward with a good dose of dark chocolate brownies, cinnamon, dark molasses, and a whiff of dark fruit (plum).  T: Bourbon forward again, not quite as well integrated as it could be with the base stout flavors of dark, dry chocolate bar, light roast, and just a bit of dark sweet fruit and coconut. Moderate sweetness brings together the rich and deep flavors, but cuts the drinkability a tad.  M: Full bodied, chewy, and sticky with sharp, medium carbonation that admirally cuts through the body.  O: Another solid barrel-aged effort from Bottle Logic, though the bourbon could be a bit better integrated.",0.6965788482788743,4.5,0.9033
Juicy,"Bottle was a slight gusher, nothing bad  A - Pours an apricot orange with a slight off-white head  S - A balance of white wine, citrus and grass. The wine faded more into the citrus side as it warmed ,very enjoyable  T - So much going on between the wine characteristics transitioning into the citrus with a funk added in. All of the flavors play off each other very well. What I want from a more ""rustic"" HF offering. I think the dried grass portion adds a lot to the finish  M - Smooth with a fair amount of carbonation  O - The layers are amazing and keep going. I was pleased how the beer changed over the 30 minutes of drinking with different profiles emerging. I would have liked more citrus but this is being picky. This was my first HF barrel offering and can't wait to try many more.",0.6710850256600656,4.5,0.9032

Starts off with some citrusy hops and moderate bitterness. Picks up some pine and floral notes as well as a balancing maltiness. Finishes with lingering citrus  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation  O: A great NE DIPA that is super easy to drink, especially given the 8.1%.

Todd The Axe Man,"From tasting notes 10/20/17 Had on-tap at StoneArch in the MSP airport, St Paul, MN  Appearance - Served up in a pint, hazy and light orange in color with a mostly barren surface and a broken, razor thin ring of suds around the edge of the glass.  Smell - Juicy and citrusy with a tropical edge. Orange and grapefruit. Pineapple, mango and guava. Yep. Pure juice bomb.  Taste - Follows up on the nose with assertive juiciness. Orange and apricot primarily, with lesser pineapple and mango. Faint grapefruit mid-taste before a light, pithy and peachy finish. Juicy acidity lingers in the finish.  Mouthfeel - Firm, medium body with moderate carbonation. Slick texture upfront turns a bit chalky and dry in the finish, but nothing unexpected of the style.  Overall - My first Surly beer, and it does not disappoint. Ive heard great things about this brewery and so far it holds credence. Very nice.",0.6981843761260651,4.25,0.9027
Fort Point Pale Ale,"16oz can - Double Dry Hopped version  Pours a small finger of white head into my willi becher glass, a little soapy looking, dissipates quickly. Good initial lacing. Body looks like orange juice. Meh, looks ok I guess.  Nose is pretty juicy, loaded with grapefruit, some mango. Dank, piney hops linger underneath the fruit. Small amount of creamy wheat present as well. Pretty nice job of staying balanced between traditional hop aromas, and fruit. Not an “American pale ale” by any means, as their website says, regardless, smells pretty good.  Flavor is good, but doesn’t quite have that crisp refreshing punch I’m looking for. A little under carbonated, and while the hops are there, they don’t help make up for the lack of carbonation with any real mouthfeel contributions – drinks like juice. As for actual flavors, mostly those dank piney hops come through. Grapefruit is a secondary flavor, mango is not really present. I’m glad the hearty hop notes are the ones that are shining, yet it is still missing something - perhaps a little watery in some areas. At times, it’s hard to differentiate between poor mouthfeel, and flavor. Definitely not a sweet NE style, which again, is good. Tastes good, but has its issues.  Not much else to say about mouthfeel that hasn’t already been said, under carbonated, a little watery, bitterness does not linger, not too sweet. Overall sub par.  The drinkability is very high, it’s not a perfect beer, but it’s very tasty and unoffensive.  Appearance turned out decent I guess. Lacing was patchy to say the least, but better than nothing.  Overall it’s a tasty brew that hits home with the right flavors, but it is a little derailed by a low carbonation and watery taste/feel.",0.687190805256116,3.75,0.9024
Swish,"Solid offering from Bissell, but does not come close to Tree House. It lacks dimensions and creaminess. Yellow pale murkiness with white head. Citrus and lemon grass. Only hints of tropics. Falls flat and monotone on the feel and flavor. All things considered, my palate has become very critical and only compare it to the best that I have had. I would drink this everyday if I could, but for a special occasion there are some better beers out there.",0.6827495573589556,4.75,0.9024

Aroma: Strong pineapple and mandarin orange followed by very juicy mango and hints of grass.  Taste: Sweet-ish bubblegum, peach, orange rind, mandarin, pineapple and cantaloupe. Finish is only lightly bitter.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, medium bodied with moderate to low carbonation.  Overall: While the aroma was very juicy, it’s taste was not so much, nevertheless it was still enjoyable and easy to drink.

Sip Of Sunshine,"16oz can poured into a teku glass. Pours a mostly clear peach hue, with minimal off-white head. Minimal, rapidly receding lacing. Nose is pine sap (almost Crusher-like), with a faint hint of honey. Floral notes on the nose are accompanied by lemon and orange peel. Dank, resinous, with a thick, honey-like character that makes it (once again) reminiscent of The Crusher. The density of the pine flavor here is what sets this IPA's palate apart - a strong pine note that plays harmoniously with a prominent, dank, lupulin component. Mouthfeel is medium - thicker than most IPAs, without being smoothie-like. This is an artful, traditional take on the DIPA style. World-class.",0.6841382578209652,4.75,0.9022

Dragonsaddle,"Canned November 15, 2015 enjoyed November 16, 2015 in a Mad Elf tulip/snifter.  Look - Clear. Bright orange. Nice white lacing. Finger of head settles to a ring. Looks tasty. Not their usual musty/murky look in other top IPAs (Roller Blabe and Konkey Dong).   Smell - Dank with both pine and must. Citrus with grapefruit, orange, lemon, and mango. Little malt like in other triple IPAs.   Taste - Very citrus forward. Has nice pine and must to do a two way balance. Luckily those are the two aspects I like in an IPA. Vanilla. Where is the alcohol?  Feel - Smooth. Not overly carbonated. Tongue rips with bitterness but no burning alcohol.  Overall - I really wish I had Columbus Brewing Company Creeper to do a side by side. This is my favorite Hoof Hearted beer, with South of Eleven close second. Not a malty triple IPA (like Devil Dancer). Doesn't border on being a strong ale as other triples do.",0.6548034759541801,4.75,0.9014

Mastermind,"Many thanks to angrybabboon for the chance to try this.  Appearance: Pours a hazy dark straw yellow. Head is bright-white and fluffy. Moderate retention leaves a small chunky cap and collar. Sticky sheets of lacing coat the glass. Sticks around for the duration. Moderate carbonation on the pour.  Smell: Ripe tropical fruit. Loaded with peach and tangerine with a small push of mango. Some solid dank/weed aromas as well. Bracing bitterness up front with a juicy fruit sweetness to temper it a bit. Malts are light and slightly bready with some toasted elements and a solid pale malt sweetness. Floral in good measure. Some pineapple and grapefruit rind as well. Hoppy without being too aggressive.  Taste: Weed soaked in fruit juice. Deeply floral with a ton of juicy tropical fruit right up front. Peaches, mango, orange, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, it's all there. A solid punch of pine resin bitterness over bitter flower petal. Malts offer a touch of balance by adding some pale malt sweetness and a slightly bready/biscuity element. Almost sweet on the initial sip before smacking of dank bitterness on the back. Slightly earthy on the back as well.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with a moderate carbonation. Slick initial sip makes it crazy easy to drink. Smooth.  Overall: An ode to Kimmich.  It's hard no to compare this to Heady Topper, but it's really not. Crazy drinkable. Flavor flashes and dissipates a bit too quick, but it pulls a flavor profile that reminds me of Heady...this is a good thing. It's not a knockout, but it's damn tasty and worth drinking in its own right.",0.6964925278985858,4.0,0.9011

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Comparing this to the non-BA Oro Negro, the differences are very minor and subtle. At a cold pour, the flavor is almost identical to the regular version, perhaps with some amplified chili heat. As it warms however, the barrel presents itself, and perhaps is the cause of the amplified burn. This definitely gets better as it warms to room temperature. Big nutty coffee, cinnamon and chili on the nose. Big Mexican chocolate vibe on the flavor. cocoa, vanilla, nuts, cinnamon, and some chili heat. Texture is coating on the palate, a bit oily. Great beer.",0.6429537419500675,4.5,0.9006
Nelson,"Poured a yellow/orangish color with one finger of foamy white head. Smell is citrus and pine all over leaving you to believe this will be a hop bomb. The taste is not as bitter as you'd think from the smell. You definitely get citrus, probably grapefruit, and a piney flavor followed by a little bitterness. All of this is smoothed out by the European malt like the label says. The mouthfeel is exactly what you'd want from an IPA, good carbonation with a slight creaminess.

Don't think the taste changed a whole lot as it warmed up. Vanilla on the aftertaste.  How much is that Breury membership? Good or better then Black Tuesday",0.6532740117633068,4.5,0.9001
Vicinity,"d from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is a hazy, straw-caramel coloring with a low profile, clingy, white head. Aromas of dried grass, berries, lemon zest, grapefruit, melon, and subtle pine resin. Very balanced aromas. Flavors are tropical fruit sweet and tangy forward, with notes of papaya, mango, melon, guava, and passion fruit, with a balance of dried grass, piney notes, and a cracker and toasted backbone. The body is full and crisp at the same time, with a dryness in the backbone. Aftertaste of tart and sweet tropical fruit notes, with a more subtle herbal and grassy hops character. The finish is smooth, dry, and with a fruity linger. Great beer.",0.7006227423190037,4.5,0.9001
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,Tan head. Black color.  Big coffee flavors. Lightly roasted. Smooth and creamy. Nice bourbon and oak. Some vanilla. Big chocolate flavors.  Full bodied. Nice feel. Light warming booze.  A great coffee ba stout. Up there with bcbcs.,0.6429625075855098,4.5,0.9001
Swish,"Finally picked some of these up in a trade and they lived up to the hype for sure. A juice bomb that hangs with the best NE IPAs. Pours a beautiful hazy orange. Aroma is pure juice - orange, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, and taste is exactly the same with just a bit of pine on the end. Creamy, juicy and smooth - this is a winner.",0.6253795442037572,4.75,0.9001
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,Best BA coffee stout I have ever had. And I have had plenty. Deep coffee roast dark stout and barrel characteristics are both balanced with the stout. Perfect beer,0.6481474755262879,5.0,0.9001
Juicy,Big thanks to Curt for sharing this with us. The brew pours a clear golden with white cap that holds well. The aroma is a pleasant mix of vinous and lemony lactic character and mild vegetal hop mix. The taste carries forth everything listed in the nose - lemony lactic aspect mingled with soft vinous appeal and a hint of caramel/vanilla oakiness. This is light in body with modest carbonation. Overall a very easy drinking and enjoyable brew that I would certainly like to drink again but the cost of admission and rarity/hype likely put this one out of reasonable reach.,0.6965771761321651,4.25,0.9
Oude Geuze Vintage,"375 ml bottle   Appearance is a cloudy golden orange color, one inch bubbly white head, great retention, some lacing at first too  Smell is tart citrus, funkiness, sour green apples, oak, and yeast  Taste starts off with tart green apples, lemon dominates the middle, more citrus in the finish with oak rounding out the aftertaste  Mouthfeel is tart, dry, and funky, medium bodied, appropriate amount of carbonation for the style, taste lingers, thirst quenching  Overall it is not overly tart, an outstanding gueuze, very nice",0.6829541470884415,4.75,0.8999

Haze,"Pours an opaque fiery orange with a finger of foamy white head. Head retention is strong with lacing prevalent after each sip. A low volume head is a bit of a disappointment on a high caliber IPA, especially a IIPA. Aroma is dripping with citrus, orange, and resin hops. Very tasty so far. A sip provides a blast of hops, and citrus - in a good way. Notes include citrus, orange, tangerine, and resin. The hops are well managed and balanced, keeping this heavy hitting beer from being difficult to drink. Mouth feel is filling, while only be a medium to medium-thick consistency. Overall, it's a very pleasing beer that is strong across all fronts. The hops are well balanced and thought out. The alcohol taste is well hidden and buried behind a flavorful, powerful beer.   Served in a 12oz snifter.",0.7052939954533841,4.5,0.8999
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"poured from a 375ml bottle into a Foam snifter 2017 bottle pours a dark brown color with a nice 2 finger tan head that hung around for a while.

Schaerbeekse Kriek,"L: Red wine colors drink. S: Very, very strong kriek flavor. T: A slow buildup into a strong kirek punch. Unlike other kriek beers in their ineup, it is very smooth and enjoyable.

Juicy,"Bottle to Lawson's sniffer  A: different throughout dark almost brown toward the top with some dark golden honey color toward the bottom with a white fluffy head. It is quite cloudy and almost completely opaque   S: you can really smell that barnyard funk from the yeast it is quite pungent there is lots of citrus smell as well mostly oranges. There is also clear hints of oak and white wine scents to round out the smell.  T: it tastes juicy with citrus and orange flavor really coming through with a sweet taste with that has the funky wine barrel taste. It is not really sour, rather there is a more fruity taste very drinkable. It is perhaps the best example of a beligan yeasty wild aged in wine barrels that I have tried.  M: clean crisp with light carbonation very easy to drink a little but oily but basically perfect for a wild ale   O: great tasting wild ale with a phenomenal mouthfeel only downside is the lack of smell and weird coloring but other then that its a really high quality offering from hfs. Yet again they know what they are doing doing drink it if you can.",0.6738140169454578,4.5,0.8995
Todd The Axe Man,"Poured into a cocktail glass (hotel beer). A moderately hazy golden-amber color with a modest white head. Below-average retention with not much lacing. Huge aromas of orange, grapefruit, blueberries, and a touch of resin. The taste was citrus out of the gate - primarily grapefruit - with a nice mix of resiny dankness and berries. A restrained malt presence that added great body but no sweetness. Outstanding.",0.6878108810602035,4.25,0.8994
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Bottle with a 2013 sticker. Reluctant to rate because this is such a distinctive beer, at once subtle and strong, and this is the first time I've had anything by Cantillon. I found it amazing, but also palate challenging. It's kind of like first time listening to Coltrane. You're not sure how to describe it or judge it, and you're at once thrilled and in over your head, but you know repetition seems really worth pursuing and will alter your tastes.",0.5834984195713491,4.5,0.8991

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"One of the best lingering aftertastes I’ve ever experienced in a beer. A near perfect combination of dark chocolate, figs, dates, vanilla, toffee, espresso, dark wood, molasses, and wheated whiskey heat.  Good looking beer, deep, dark, blackish brown body with dark mocha head.  Expedition’s outstanding base aromas and flavors with nicely complimentary barrel and whiskey notes. Exactly what I was hoping for in a BA version.  A tad thin, feel-wise, though still strong bodied and slightly sticky. Not sure if I’m remembering regular Expedition wrong, but the BA version feels thinner.",0.6668776129460914,4.5,0.899
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Nice looking beer with a nearly opaque color and a nice foamy tan head that lingered. Whiskey, coffee, cocoa, and caramel on the nose. The taste was a bit too much whiskey for me, but there was a nice sweetness and roastiness from the honey to balance things out. Not overly cloying, but essentially two dominant aspects (whiskey and honey) that battle it out. Definitely not subtle.",0.6674212103695013,4.25,0.899
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"* Brewed in 2006  Appearance - 4.0 Pours a finger of light pink head that reduced to a thin layer over a dark red body that shines a little orange where the light catches it.  Smell - 4.5 The nose almost cringes from the sourness! Once the initial shock is over there is great depth and complexity - tart raspberry, wood, blackcurrant and wet blanket.  Taste - 4.0 Oak barrels mustiness and classic lambic notes are funky and super sour. Tart raspberry is juicy and a little sweet, but this is just drowned in the sourness and complexity. Wow!  Mouthfeel - 4.0 You have to keep the tongue moving to keep up with the tangy, sticky and lightly fizzy mouthfeel.  Drinkability - 3.0 About as expected for a traditional lambic, but the more you drink the better it is.  OVERALL - 4.0 About as good as a traditional fruit lambic can be. Amazingly complex but very hard to drink.",0.7001411583129815,3.0,0.899
Beatification,"Had it at RRBC on tap.   L: Golden Yellow, only slightly hazy, minimal head that goes away almost immediately.   S: Pungent. A sweet fruity nose upfront with pears and citrus accompanied by a generous amount of sour funk.  T: Tangy stone fruit, lemon (quite tart), then the brett kicks in and bring the funk, slightly yeasty. Overall a nice balance of flavor.   F: Long tart finish that goes through waves of lemon and wheat for a few minutes.   O: A world class beer, phenomenal balance and unlike some of the heavier more robust sours that Russian River offers like consecration, beatification can easily be followed by another beatification.",0.6897278999870867,4.25,0.8988

Sip Of Sunshine,Pours somewhat Amber In color. Has a bit of cloudiness but is not really hazy. It does not glow like many beers of this style. Still looks good though. Smell is juicy. Papaya mango and a touch of tangerine. Taste is sweet on the front end with only a light bitterness on the back end. Feels rather carbonated at first but it mellows out over the course of the glass. Feels a tad heavy as well. Overall a great beer that lives up the NE IPA hipe.,0.6530916731739665,4.5,0.8987
Fort Point Pale Ale,Its amazing how Trillium puts out great beer after great beer. They don't smash you in the face like Treehouse juice bombs but they are just so damn well done. Balanced and super smooth.,0.6115799971906958,4.25,0.8986
Sure Bet,"A very nice take on the west coast style by Pipeworks! One finger head on a dark auburn filtered brew. Smells mostly of bubblegum (chicklets), papaya and a little mango. Tastes even more on the Bubble gum side but is very enjoyable and not hot, though my friend and I did get some indigestion soon afterwards.",0.5707633983517498,4.5,0.8985
Flora - Blueberry,"Pours a beautiful violet color with a thin short-lived head. The nose is full of a cheesy sweaty funk, hints of sweet blueberry, vinouse wine, woody dryness, and earth. I get more blueberry on the mouth than the nose, reminiscent of juicy fruity blueberry jam mixed with wine. The finish is earthy and mildly funky. Medium body, clean and fairly juicy mouthfeel with soft and faint carbonation. Not the best blueberry beer available but I definitely enjoyed this.",0.6880446659534106,4.0,0.8983
Black Tuesday,"2016 version from the Bruery.  pours a dark black with little head.   dark chocolate, figs/ fruits, molasses and bourbon nose. taste is very similar- but hides the booze really well.   super excited to see how my other bottles age",0.5545668458093972,4.5,0.8981
Dragonsaddle,"The beer comes in a hazy medium gold color.  The aroma is green and earthy, with a surrounding tropical aroma.  The flavor is a fruit orgasm of passionfruit, peach, guava, mango, tart orange and tangerine. Smoothie for days like Tree House. A bready malt comes in the middle as the beer ends with an earthy bitter herb finish and alcohol slowly drags it way down on the palate and esophagus.  A beer to enjoy 4-6 oz. of as alcohol comes with palate fatigue on this big, but delectable, strong hoppy brew.",0.6720623407521127,4.5,0.8979
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"On tap in a table glass. Pitch black with minimal dark mocha head. The maple notes work well here - they're not as pronounced as Founder's CBS for example, but they're certainly distinct and work well with the base beer. Moreover, they don't overpower the underlying imp stout, which serves this beer well. A solid brew overall.",0.6435514329882274,4.25,0.8979
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,Dark chocolate in appearance. Smell the maple and bourbon notes. Taste is great. I fabulous mix of flavors. Maple sweetness is apparent upfront. Bourbon dominates the back end.,0.6448177508098754,4.75,0.8979
Swish,"16 oz can.  Light amber and cloudy with one finger of head. I got a lot of stone fruit in the aroma along the lines of peach and apricot. Very smooth in the flavor, with deep fruitiness. There is restraint and balance, rather than in-your-face, bold, citric flavors. Clean finish that shows little sign of the beer's strong ABV. I enjoyed this one much more than The Substance.",0.7048376399724066,4.25,0.8979
Swish,While this is a great beer I actually prefer Substance and Reciprocal. Lux is interesting in its own right since its a rye beer. Perhaps Swish is higher rated since it is so much harder to get. Regardless Bissell Brothers are making some great beers.,0.5773220030480177,4.5,0.8979
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Pours a nice, hazy orange with a vigorous head. Aroma is a tropical blast of pineapple with some Bretty notes; the balance is definitely toward the fruit. Flavor is an evolution across citrus flavors; starts with nice, tart lemon; transitions to orange when a hint of sweetness emerges; finishes with grapefruit as the a bitterness registers. One of the ""cleanest"" geuezes I've had. Crisp and refreshing. Quite nice!",0.7205348056872208,4.5,0.8977
Scaled Up,"Can dated 3/29/17. Poured into Behind the Veil Teku glass.  L: 2F head with pretty good retention. Leaves spotty lacing and a little bit of a cap and ring. Beer is a hazy pale golden.  S: Pineapple and orange, other tropical fruits. Light malts. Decent amount of earthiness on back end.  T: Pineapple and orange up front, with more exotic fruits like kiwi and passionfruit. Light malt in the middle and a fair amount of earthiness in a slightly bitter finish.  F: Light to medium body, light carbonation. Very good construction and balance.  O: Another in a long line of great Trillium DIPAs.",0.6703679601017142,4.25,0.8977
Sip Of Sunshine,"16 oz can at a brew pub in Stowe, VT. Poured into a pint tulip glass. Nice golden color with one inch head an lots of lacing as it was consumed.

Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"750ml bottle dated 03/09/16  Pours an opaque dark gold with a frothy off-white head. Smells like lime zest, guava, passionfruit, mango, grapefruit, tangerine, fresh pine, and dank woodsy grass.

Overall a really great and unique double dry hopped IPA.",0.6275417317535044,4.75,0.8977
Nelson,"Pours an opaque gold with a big cap of foamy white head. The head has great retention and leaves trails of small sticky lacing. The aroma is good, with light floral and citrus hops notes balancing against each other. The flavor is much the same with an additional malt that isn't really noticeable but holds up the hops, which are more prominent in the taste than the aroma. The body is just the right weight, hitting that sweet spot of having a little heft but not being too thick for its flavor. There is just a slight bite from the hops on the finish.",0.6745298764448752,4.25,0.8977
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Review is based on the dregs (last in line for a pour). Pours a cloudy orange hue akin to Sunny Delight. Nose expresses citrus, rind a just a hint of the wine barrel. Taste follows nose - a little little yeasty, but to be expected considering the pour was off the bottom of the bottle. Mouthfeel is light in body with a mild, even carbonation. All and all, quite enjoyable; however, I'd like to revisit with a proper pour.",0.6454409300052751,4.0,0.8977

Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"2.11.15 Bottle, Thanks Chris!  Nice nose, very similar Trillium IPA flavor. Nice citrus flavor with a hint of anise. Similar to Mastermind for my palate.

Peche 'n Brett,"Thanks to ? for sharing, and to Dan for hosting :thumbup: Quick review from written notes.  This was the latest batch that came out this year. Hazy orange with a compact head and some spotty lace around the edges, thin veil across the surface.   Nice subtle peachy aroma, pleasantly fruit forward. Increases as it warms.  Moderately sour upfront, lightly bitter in the aftertaste. Definite peach taste and aroma, seemed a little more prevalent in the taste. Overall a great wild ale, Brett wasn't all that expressive but you can't go wrong with a peach sour ale, imho.",0.6942601853710679,4.25,0.8975
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Thanks to Thomas for this one. Side-by-side with all the other BA Dark Lords. Bottle 123/420 into a snifter. From notes.  Same appearance as the others.  Big bourbon notes on the nose. Very sweet. Some chocolate, dark fruit, fudge, and cocoa powder. Solid.  Sweet plum, prune, chocolate. Low booziness lingers in the background. Sweet soy sauce in the middle. Molasses, fudge in the finish. Some chocolate also. Fudge in the aftertaste. Really good. Not as bold as the Pappy version.  Same feel as the others. Oily, slick, viscous, slightly sticky aftertaste.   This isn't as impressive as the Pappy Dark Lord. However, there's more balance here and a touch more subtlety. A solid beer.",0.6421177766124795,4.0,0.8974
Peche 'n Brett,"Golden and hazy with loads of fast rising carbonation, and a half finger of white head.  Smells very Brett forward. Funky, sour lambic qualities, earthy, dusty brewery filled with cobwebs that remind me of Cantillon. Oak barrel as well. There is a light fruitiness, perhaps peach but not yet distinguishable. Macaroni and a lactic milk like quality.  Tastes of sour and slightly sweet, not bone dry. All the Brett, earthy, dusty lambic and oak come through, and it ends with fermenting fruit.  Medium to strong, acidic body, with loads of carbonation.  Got his first bottle in Sacramento, and I have a second one from Oregon waiting for me. Drinking for the first time Dec 20th, 2018. Complex and unique, funky brew.",0.68404585951902,4.25,0.8974

Haze,"Wow. This beer starts off with and amazing pour, both in its coloration and it's beautiful head. Hazy, almost pastel orange colour. Appears practically radioactive. Screaming juicy and it doesn't disappoint. Strong blood orange aroma. Taste is well balanced. Oranges with a bit of peach. Not too sweet or acidic. Soft mouth feel with considerable body. A real thrill to drink this!",0.6693676718015859,4.75,0.8972

Very GGGreennn,"Canned 06/07/19, 10:48:01. “CORBIN! CORBIN! MY MAN I HAVE NO FIRE!”  Opaque golden pour, great hue with soft, creamy head that rises about a half an inch above the body of the beer. As it settles, even layers of lace cling desperately to the inside of the glass.  The nose isn’t overpowering, hitting first with aromas of candied grapefruit, pineapple, and melon. Not overly complex, just a clean, citrusy, and straightforward. A more noticeable booziness as the beer opens up a little.  The Green series from Treehouse is no doubt great, but I’d never picked it out as my favorite offerings from them. This one definitely stands apart. Comparable to a brighter, more citrus-forward Juice Machine, the palate is hit with flavors of pineapple, cantaloupe, stone fruit, and tangerine, with softer notes of lemon, mango and passionfruit.  Medium-bodied, medium-carbed, but very soft going down. Drinks incredibly smooth, with the 8.3%ABV dangerously well-hidden. There is some boozy warmth felt on the tail, but beyond that there’s no indicator that this is closing in on 10%.",0.6963578807983759,4.5,0.897
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"2005 bottle poured at cellar temp  this beer pours a purple reddish color with thin to barely there head. the smell is huge barnyard funk with a faint cherry note and some tart notes mixed in as well. the flavor follows suit with the funkiness taking the cake cherry flavor is all but gone, and there is a tart finish. the mouthfeel was thin and slightly acidic. overall a good beer, but would like to try fresh",0.6493258565545903,4.5,0.8969
Oude Geuze Vintage,"750mL, Vintage 2006, from notes on 3/27/11.  Pours a clear strawberry-blond, brilliant for the style. The head is small and wispy.  The nose is pungently funky in a woody, resiny way, along with some earthy and plastic-phenolic notes. Excellent.  Huge tartness is immediately revealed. Borderline harsh sourness is near Cantillon territory. The fruitiness comes mid-palate, with apple, grapefruit and sour cherry notes. Oaky barrel flavor is apparent, and the finish is acidic, dry, and bitter. The mouthfeel has surprisingly low carbonation, so this drinks almost like apple juice. Really, really sour and funky apple juice that is.  I don't know about this one. It was quite the complex sour experience, but I was expecting something smooth and refined with all the age on it. I enjoyed the standard 3 Fonteinen Gueuze more. Worth a try, it might be your thing.",0.7146217222335766,3.5,0.8966
Society & Solitude #4,"Cloudy yellow with two fingers of creamy, off-white head. The head sticks around for a good while and leaves heavy lacing.  Creamy orange aroma — like an Orange Julius made with tangerines and clementines.  There’s an explosion of citrus medley up front in the taste, with clementine, tangerine, orange, lime that again includes some creaminess and light sweetness, but that’s cut by a pithy, grassy finish. There’s a slight mineral water / soda water element to it as well that prevents the fruits from being over the top.  Medium bodied and smooth feel with just enough carbonation.  Really excellent beer. 10/22/18 canned on date.",0.6798967405904925,4.5,0.8966

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Reviewed on 9/27/17, from notes  L - Pours motor oil brown with a medium mocha head S - I get big bourbon notes. Lots of brown sugar and molasses. If I inhale deeply I also get big cinnamon notes.  T - Best way to describe it is chocolate and marshmallow with a caramel middle. Slight bitter and cinnamon chili spice on the finish F - Nice and creamy medium body. A little chewy. O - Very well balanced barrel aged chili stout.

T: Chocolate, caramel, slight roast, with an appropriate level of sweetness.  M: Very faint carbonation and heavy bodied.  O: Very impressed, with this year's Black Tuesday.

Very balanced between the two with both flavors popping.  F: medium thickness and creamy but not that coating.",0.6651671008936337,4.25,0.8963
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Overall this is an incredible beer. It pours like motor oil, like every other TG stout. It smells like maple syrup, bourbon, chocolate and vanilla.

Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"375ml bottle poured into large snifter 2016 vintage gifted to me by EZ  Pours medium to dark brown with almost no head to speak of. This really speaks to the light carbonation of this brew, because it doesn’t taste oxidized at all. Very light and smooth. Nose is bourbon heavy and brownie batter. Sweet chocolate and bourbon are present but take a back seat to roasted walnut/pecan. Maple doesn’t become present until the chill is broken and it warms a bit. The warmer this gets, the more the flavors pop off the charts. All the flavors meld together well. If I had to say that one thing shines in this beer it has to be the nuttiness, hands down. Fantastic brew!",0.6411064965192894,4.5,0.8958

Enjoy By IPA,"Pours a solid amber in color with a milky white head that lingers through the session. Heavy amounts of lacing present.   Aromas consists of tangerine and grapefruit, and slightly piney.  A solid hit of grapefruit on the tongue initially, supported by a thin layer of biscuit and caramel sweetness. Finishes with a strong dose of piney hop bitterness.  Dry with a medium to heavy body. Medium carbonation and just a hint of heat from the alcohol.   This is another solid and enjoyable brew from Stone.",0.6854385714552379,4.0,0.8957
Haze,"This beer is exceptional. Uniform peach haze with half finger of white head. Not murky. Their description is spot on with orange, peach, and passion fruit all present. Overall awesome.

All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"I had to put my hatred for milk stouts aside for this rating. If you are into Milk Stouts this is one of the best I have ever tried. Hands down a must trade for. Personally I hate them but I had to get these for my sister.  Black as night, smells like a Cafe Mocha, and the taste is like an alcoholic Yoohoo. Straight up chocolate milk in a can. Slightly more watery than their stouts like Double Shot but overall this is an A+ for a Milk Stout.",0.5652504017664575,4.0,0.8957

Haze,"Hands down the most drinkable 8.2% beer I've ever tasted, only surpassed by Very Hazy. The smell is great, feel is excellent, the look is outstanding - as the name describes, this is the absolute perfection of the hazy look.

Chocolate Rain,"2014 Vintage, reviewed from notes written 5/2/14. Poured into a Bruery glass.  A - Pitch black, little to no head. To be expected with the alcohol content.  S - Huge bouquet of bourbony-booze, vanila, semi-sweet chocolate and caramel.  T - Giant bakers and semi-sweet chocolate notes. Insanely chocolatey and not that artificial tootsie-roll chocolate. Super boozy. Bourbon, vanilla, and more chocolate in the background.   M - Surprisingly well carbed, full bodied, rich and velvety.  O - In a class all its own. Hard to even compare to other imperial stouts.",0.625500571465645,4.5,0.8952
Mastermind,I was fortunate to get several 4 packs of this during his October release from a friend traveling in Vermont. This beer is amazing! 2 weeks in the can showed explosive hop character and reminded me of a tropical hop punch! I added Fiddlehead to my Vermont trip for next year because of this beer. I actually prefer this over Heady Topper now. Get you some!,0.5067379815238574,4.75,0.8951

But sometimes I say to myself ""If I became a ruthless dictator I could make the folks at Alpine open a brewery in my backyard."" I have been lucky enough to stage a few of their beers here in North Carolina and Nelson is the third of their beers that I have tried and each one has been extremely good.  Do not pass this beer up.",0.4993055900104575,4.5,0.895
Haze,"Special; sublime; smoother than I expected. A citrus bomb - you'll want to lick the lacing off the glass to not lose a single taste of orange. I don't taste or sense the bitterness of some other DIPAs. It's almost dangerously easy to drink for its ABV level. A great accomplishment! UPDATE: No change to ranking, just wanted to mention that after tasting samples from another release on a different canning date, this beer is equally as impressive as it was in the last release I tried. I find in general I enjoy Treehouse beers more after a few weeks in the fridge following release, as I notice more of the fruit both in the nose and the taste. This is one of my favorites.",0.6301911041698798,4.75,0.8949

Fort Point Pale Ale,"Look is pale golden-orange with a cloudy, pulpy haze and a frothy, bubbly white head that provides some faint lacing. Smell is tropical citrus and sharp grapefruit, very pungent and sweet. Taste is dominated, for me, by grapefruit bitterness, very pithy and puckering, with grassy and herbal notes, some nectarine sweetness, and a light biscuity backbone. Very juicy, refreshing, and tasty. Feel is quite substantial. Medium mouthfeel, silky and creamy on the tongue, which adds to the lasting bitterness that seems to hang on forever. Fantastic beer, and outstanding APA.",0.7002396619105076,4.25,0.8947
Black Tuesday,"2013 bottle shared by some great people after Hunahpu's Day 2014. Great deep black with some tan head, decent legs, not much for lacing. Hot hot hot. Even with a year on this, the bourbon heat is alive and well. Aroma is boozey up front, vanilla, toffee, and molasses behind that bourbon heat. Taste is also very boozey. I get the vanilla, some faint dark fruit (raisin or something of the like), some good oakiness. Slightly thin in the mouthfeel, but I enjoy the low carbonation and fairly thick body.",0.6390085350654746,3.75,0.8945

Madagascar,"Medium-dark brown with a thin brown head. Aroma is sweet vanilla, hints of bourbon and roasty malts.

Enjoy By IPA,"Pours clear, like well shined brass, with a small-to-medium head that leaves plenty of lace. Nose is not big at all for what I thought this beer would be. Certainly some malt syrup and a little dank citrus, but certainly could have been bigger. Taste is more like what I expected with both the heavy hops and malt coming through. Earthy, bitter citrus, and heavy graham cracker. Very good beer, but I expected more.",0.6507020007246339,4.25,0.8943
Sip Of Sunshine,"I never thought something would ever challenge Heady Topper for the top spot in my IPA list but here we are. It pours a deep, cloudy amber and the aroma hits you right away.

Aaron,"One of the better barleywines that I have had.  This was dead on or even with King Henry and around the same level as A Deal With the Devil for me.  Notes of caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla and oak. Perfect balance. The unknown ABV on this makes it fun, really cannot tell what % this would fall under. Drinks like 7 or 8% but very well could be 15.  Would love to have this one again.",0.5861124868969813,5.0,0.8943
Sip Of Sunshine,"Pours a hazy, particle-laden peach with a robust, big-bubbled, bone-colored head.  Aromas carry across the room as soon as the can is cracked. Big, big mango, pine sap, cherimoya, grapefruit, and salt hit the nose hard as a unified whole. A layer of alcohol creeps in underneath.  Taste is big and piney, with a sharp lash of grapefruit pith bitterness right behind. Remarkably focused. The nose suggested flabby fruit juice, but this is all bracing bitterness. A puckerer. Booze rises up as it warms, which loses some points.  Feel is quite nice, on the fuller side of things.  Great to see an actually bitter IPA these days; so many focus only on juiciness and leave the purpose of the beer behind. Overall, a solid offering, but I wouldn't race out to the store. Would enjoy again, but not necessarily my first choice from the cooler.",0.6768971362068784,4.0,0.8942

Nectarine Premiere,"L: Radiant shining hues of apricots, tangerines, and pumpkins with an ample fluffy white head S: A touch of farmhouse funk on the nose is met with balanced nectarines, peaches, and citrus T: Incredibly balanced acidity (in contrast to some de Garde brews I've had) is of course met by ample stone fruits and hay F: Moderate and incredibly smooth body is complemented by a touch of carbonation that provides a delicate yet robust base O: Very enjoyable wild saison from one of the best in the game. While fruit forward, the beer retained its farmhouse heritage and did not deviate like some over-fruited saisons unfortunately can. All in all this is one of the most balanced saisons I've ever had and it beautifully blended the fruits. Well done.",0.7587545128009618,4.75,0.8938
Black Tuesday,"Popped open this '13 vintage at a share, about an 8 oz pour around cellar temp.  Pours a near-black body with a thin mocha head, minimal lacing and retention, unsurprising given the abv.  Smell is of a sweet and roasty malt base with bourbon present and not overpowering. Nice notes of chocolate, vanilla, toffee, caramel, and figs.  Taste is akin to the nose, with a roasty sweet base, medium bitterness, good bourbon flavor, and barrel characters shining through. Alcohol is noticeable but incredibly palatable given the insane abv.  Mouthfeel is thick, smooth, syrupy, sticky, low carbonation, very nice.  Overall, a phenomenal BBA stout worthy of the accolades it receives.",0.6773968562248459,4.75,0.8937
Nelson,"Exceptionally clear orange-straw color with a finger-and-a-half of white head and heavy lacing. Subtle floral aroma, with orange, peach, grapefruit and lemon peel in the background, definitely reminiscent of white wine, as advertised. The fruit carries over to the taste, perhaps more than balanced out by a stronger-than-expected hop bitterness and clear rye character in the malt. Medium bodied, slightly creamy with good carbonation. Very glad to have tried this one.",0.7159711681981582,4.25,0.8937
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"2015 bottle on my 40th birthday. Pours a solid black with a thin layer of tan head with no lacing. Nose is a delicious blend of caramel, roasty attributes, and whiskey. Taste is an even better blend of the nose attributes. Mouthfeel is surprisingly a bit thin for the ABV, carbonation good, and the finish sweet and bitter that doesn't linger. Good, very much so. Worth the price, debatable.",0.6848356694366055,4.25,0.8937
Oude Geuze Vintage,"With thanks to ?, Sorry I forgot who brought this 2005 bottle. I was able to try this beer on a tasting organized by Fiona de Lange (the Dutch beer lady) at 'de Molen'.  A - An amber colored beer that is clear in appearance. There is no foam.  S - I would call this sour funk.  T - Not so sour and fresh in taste, actually it is pretty nice and soft.  M - A soft to medium carbonation and the finish is of course: sour.  O - I am not a sour beer fan. That is way the scores are this low I guess, but this sour I would love to try it again!",0.5923738605919829,3.0,0.8935

Haze,"Pours a hazy (obviously) golden yellow color with a frothy bone white head. The smell hits your nose right as you open the can. Notes of mango, pineapple, guava, grapefruit, and orange. Also getting a slightly weedy aroma as well. Taste is majorly up front with pineapple, mango, and guava, with bitter grapefruit and orange zest coming through towards the end. Alcohol is slightly noticeable. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Carbonation is slightly low but helps with the overall mouthfeel. Overall, an amazing NE DIPA. It has that typical tropical taste and smooth feel you'd expect from breweries like Tree House, Trillium, and Monkish.",0.6813590995366127,4.5,0.8934
Peche 'n Brett,"2014 vintage, poured in oversized wine glass  Peche n Brett   A- pours a hazy golden yellow color with a creamy white head that retains long after the pour   S- fresh peach aroma mixed with vanilla cream, with some Brett funk, notes of hay, vinous wood, earth and floral notes.   T- fresh peach juice flavor hits the palate immediately, quickly followed by some Brett funk with notes of light barnyard and wet hay, slightly spicy leading to a dry finish with light tart and more peach.   M- medium body with low carbonation leads to a foamy and tart mouthfeel and a bone dry finish   O- this is all about the peach, and it showcases it brilliantly, one of the best of the style IMO",0.6696988228139837,4.5,0.8934

Haze,Canned this morning. As fresh as it gets. Overall this beer seemed flat. The color was a dull gold. The beer is thick and solid - fully opaque. The smell is mildly sweet. The brewery had the same mild aroma today. Taste is subtle. Nothing is over powering in it and the feel has a faint bite that lingers and mellows with time. For a DIPA this is an easy drinker.  I am excited to enjoy some for the next week or so and see how it grows.,0.6842723285965612,3.5,0.8934

Chocolate Rain,"Had 2 bottles. Finally just couldn't wait anymore and had to crack one open. Pours dark black, with zero head, zero bubbles at all. The smell is way too hot. Loads of alcohol, as well as chocolate, roasts, vanilla, and a bit of bourbon. Taste is sweet from the vanilla. Not as much chocolate flavor as Black Tuesday, and also extremely hot. Just too much booze. However, once you get pass the booziness, it is blended nicely. Mellow chocolate, sweet vanilla, and balanced bourbon make the flavor have a lot to look forward to. Mouthfeel, once again, just overrun with booziness. Full, and creamy, but the booze is just too much. Overall, I gave this a 4.5 based on how I think this will develop. I'm going to wait at least 2 years to open my 2nd bottle, and I think this will be amazing once the booziness fades. At the moment, I prefer Black Tuesday over Chocolate Rain, but that could change with some age.",0.6218696529921073,4.5,0.8934

Scaled Up,"Thanks Mike! 3 week old bottle so still really fresh!  Pours out that hazy, turbid, opaque pineapple juice look of the NE hoppy beers.  Aroma explodes with white grape/white wine from the Nelson hops followed by juicy tropical fruit notes of mango, pineapple and orange. Touch of dankness too.  Flavor up front is dominated by the white grape of the Nelson Sauvin hops, but is quickly followed by juicy pineapple, orange/tangerine, peach, mango and apricot of the Mosaic hops. Finish is more spicy and has notes of resin and light pine along with dankness and a slight herbal character. Very juicy, but has enough bitterness to make it more drinkable.  Medium bodied with a slightly thinner mouthfeel and completely hidden alcohol! Too drinkable!  Overall, just another amazing beer! Trillium is making some of my new favorite beers. Now if I could just have this in the fridge all the time.....",0.6546531618112293,4.75,0.8933
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"2011 Bottling; # 3266. Picked up from Matt at Capone's at release. Cellared since then. Been saving this from a mixed case full of Eclipse back in the day. Unsure if original or based on aging...but what I thought was going to be a powerhouse instead was a gentle sipper of immense complexity.  Am I huge fan of Elijah Craig bourbon, and was delighted with its characteristic enveloping vanilla, caramel sweetness and strains of resin from the barrel. The chocolate comes through in both nose and taste. Hints of citrus rind bitterness and molasses.  Had an attractive color with dark brown an hints/sparks of ruby in the light. No residual head/lacing... as might be expected. No ABV and very smooth carbonation; very slightly syrupy. Enhancement not a concern. Gentle sipper, seductively sweet and delicious. FWIW...agree with others..there are many many good BA Imp Stouts out there these days. And I also get worried when more that $1/oz.  But I would still recommend this if you get a chance to grab a 2011.",0.6638735990903873,4.5,0.8933

Beatification,"375ml cork and cage. Bottled 1/10/12.  Murky, pale golden. Tiny and fizzy yellowish head, leaving nothing behind.  Lemon citrus, slight funk grass and some cedar on the nose.  Earthy and grassy flavors at first, with a ton of carbonation. Very active in the mouth. Big, citric tartness, lemon mostly, nearing a sourness. Finish is a slowly fading, juicy lemon flavor, not overly dry for the amount of carbonation. A funkiness and light pepper spicing develops as the beer warms, adding deeper layers to the flavor.  Phenomenal. Easily the best American wild ale I've had, topping even Cable Car.",0.6791158543206917,5.0,0.8932
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"e at brewery. Ruby hued body with a sudsy, quickly dissipating pale pink head. Smells exactly like a fresh picked raspberry crushed between the fingers. Taste is like a raspberry with the sweetness mostly sucked out of it: the tartness from the natural innoculation complements the inherent raspberry tartness very well. Medium bodied with a lingering fruity character. Complex and elegant   93/100",0.6908055975931209,4.5,0.8932

S: Sweet and funky stone fruit, lots of toasted oak, orange tangerine, like a delicious sweet and sour candy. Big and enticing aroma.  T: Sweet and sour candy, a moderate mouth-puckering sourness. A little fruit and oak barrel are detectable but the other flavors dominate it.  M: Medium body and medium light carbonation, creamy body.

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2006 vintage on-tap at the infamous Ebenezer's, Lovell Maine. Some cellphone notes.  Pours red with pretty much no head whatsoever. It's aged so understandable. Nice color though.  Raspberry very strong in the smell, reminds me of Raspberry Tart but with a buttload of sour funk.  Raspberries also pretty strong in the taste but also covered with an insane amount of sourness. Extremely vinegary, barnyard notes, very sour lemon, did I mention sour? Totally numbing to the tongue. It only gets more sour and funky as it goes on.  Although very enjoyable, this has to be the most sour beer I've had, as I've heard of the Lou Pepe series.",0.617561589491645,3.5,0.8929

Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"A- A tall can drops a hazy golden yellow brew into a tall chalice. Atop that beer a thick and creamy white cap rises up to about a half inch high with good retention. Wide sheets of lace coat a large area on the glass.  S- Juicy and extremely bright thanks to a very intense grapefruit and lime citrus juice presence from the hops. As one would expect the hops dominate with the aforementioned plus peach, mango, pineapple, orange, onion and passionfruit.  T- The taste brings a similar balance as the aroma did but it does shift from juicy to a bit more zesty with the advent of the bitterness in the flavor profile. Mainly about the notes of pineapple, mango, peach, grapefruit with intense pine resin, melon, dank herbs, floral and tangerine hints beyond those.  MF- Luscious and creamy medium body with high end carbonation. Finishes with a sharp and zesty citrus bitterness lingering on the taste buds.  An amazingly bright aroma of citrus and tropical fruits leads into a good but not mind blowing flavor profile which seems to lose some steam to the bitterness present muddling the distinct things found in the smell. Better than most but not one of the best Trillium IPAs.",0.7037410649242992,4.25,0.8924
Oude Geuze Vintage,"It was a vintage 1999, consumed at The Festival in Portland, Maine, summer of '13.  My affected senses were overcome by varying shades of peach, apricot, and a stunning variety of stone fruit, both real and imaginary, dancing upon a canvass of tart, freshly hung on the wall of a musty barn.  I do not deceive you when I say that the finish lingered on my palate for days, even after sipping on many other formidable concoctions.   It might be the greatest beer I have ever had.",0.6311085185099206,4.75,0.8924
Black Tuesday,"I'm not a huge Stout fan and really not a bourbon barrel fan but I try to be fair to the tastes and beers I try, like this one.  Smells big and intense yet tasty even to me. Rather intense/big taste but still felt smooth to me over all. The taste didn't seem to linger on the tongue so long that I couldn't taste anything else, which was a nice difference to me at least. This baby is big and can slap you in the face at 18-19% but if you're a fan of stouts and bourbon barrel aging, definitely get this. 2014 rating 4.44  2019 rating is 4.75",0.5917074478559425,4.75,0.8923
Chocolate Rain,"Bottles shared by two different people today at the Plan Bee Savage release.  Pours a dark amber-brown, a lot lighter than I'd expected. There's no head or lacing at all.  Smells like chocolate milk on steroids. Smells creamy, vanilla and chocolate all over the place, plus bracing alcohol.  And, unsurprisingly, this also tastes like chocolate milk on steroids. It tastes like chocolate liqueur more than beer. Amplified chocolate flavor all over. It tastes like chocolate milk, with about 50 additional Hershey's bars melted into it. There's some sweet marshmallow vanilla flavors. This is so sweet and cloying, the smaller pours definitely helped this stay relevant for me. Much more than 4 oz or so and this would be tiring. The alcohol burn is noticeable, but not quite as prominent as I would've expected.  This is surprisingly and weirdly thin bodied, I thought it would've been fudgy. The mouthfeel is incredibly syrupy and sweet, though, with basically no carbonation.  Quite an extreme beer. Tastes great, but not without its problems.",0.6467208891439956,5.0,0.8922

Very tart, and very dry but there's a little bit of stickiness in the finish. This is a lot of very rich, sour beer. It's pretty busy, but very tasty.",0.6694243634732714,4.25,0.8919
Peche 'n Brett,"Best by 01/2016  Near turbid golden with a central dome of light cream foam and little lace. The nose is really nice, peaches, apricots, brett, seltzer, vitamins, tart tones and just a touch of sweetness at the end. Nice tartness on the sides of the tongue, some brett watery character, some bits of lacto style yogurt character and plenty of peach, but the peach seems unripened. Medium on full bodied with hi carb that dissipates quickly and leaves me quite dry - this forces me to take another drink...sadly/not! Nice beer.",0.6667071625528227,4.25,0.8919
Aaron,"***batch 1 - brewed 4-2014, 3 years old  L: pours a thick syrup light brownish golden color with no head. It's dark brown in the glass. S: awesome bourbon, sweet raisins T: well balanced with the the bourbon taste and no booze mixed with plenty of sweetness. Taste a mix between sugar raisins and purple grape juices. F: a smooth and thick syrup sticky feel O: a great Ba barleywine for sure.",0.6173899983971025,4.75,0.8918
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Bottle consumed at the Holy Grale in Louisville Kentucky on New Years Day.  What a treat. This pours vibrant red with a minimal head but decent effervescence. The nose is a beautiful balance between neutral oak, raspberries, sour yeast, and cherries. The taste is right in line with the nose. Moderate level of tartness. Moderate carbonation, fairly thin, moderate smoothness.   This is not sweet or syrupy. This has a strong raspberry flavor that is tight in line with the tart level and influence from the barrel. Another home run from Cantillon.",0.7130036192518988,4.5,0.8917
Double Orange Starfish,"No canned date  Appearance - Pours quite hazy and dirty orange in color with an off-white, near two-finger width head. Fair retention results in a thin, broken layer or suds. Not much for lacing outside a few small patches and a handful of spots found here and there.  Smell - Strong citrusy aroma. Orange, tangerine and a hint of grapefruit with faint mango.   Taste - Follows the nose. Prominent juicy orange flavor upfront and throughout. Hints of mango and dank round out the main flavor profile. Faint grapefruit. Aftertaste has a mild tangerine and mango zest with continuing earthy dank character and orange sweetness.  Mouthfeel - On hte fuller side of medium-bodied with moderate, tingly carbonation. Slick, slightly creamy texture with that goes down nicely before a mostly dry finish.  Overall - Really tasty prominent orange hazy. Reminds me quite a bit of New Glory Liquid Grove when it was first released, though with more earthy dank qualities.",0.6893017964256094,4.5,0.8913

Juicy,"Pours a dark orange, comes out almost light a light syrup. Has a very familiar Hill Farmstead saison aroma filled with funk and a 'chlorine.' Taste does not follow the nose -- Orange and fruit, sweet candy, tropical with a funk and oak. Some carbonation on the tongue. This is a very tasty, tropical, and flavorful sour. Seems like it could be appreciated by just about anyone as it does a lot of things right, and nothing over-the-top. The hype is real. Hoping to try another one of these from the cellar after a year or so.",0.6475373980869578,4.75,0.891
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),and rich. As big as a stout can possibly be. Loads of sweetness and minimal bitterness or roast to balance. The bourbon barrel provides the balance. A hint of dryness and loads of vanilla and bourbon. The sweetness helps elevate the barrel notes.,0.6821743736618151,4.75,0.891
Juicy,"375 mL bottle from December 2016. Decanted carefully in case of sediment, Juicy pours an orange-copper with a thin layer of head from bubbles that rise up in a curiously slow way, as if the liquid is more viscous than it otherwise seems. Beautiful aromas of white wine, apple cider vinegar, papaya, honeydew melon, and orange blossom. The perfect amount of bright acidity on the tongue, enough to get the salivary glands pumping but not so much as to overwhelm the delicate complexity of flavors on parade here. I'm loving the influence of the wine barrels.",0.6568521273615259,4.25,0.891
Sip Of Sunshine,"Pillow of thick, tight white foam sits upon pale amber (9) liquid; long lasting cap; moderately heavy lacing; excellent clarity. Aromas of grapefruit, mango, passion fruit, and green hops. Grapefruit juice, lemon rind, bitter green hops, mango, passion fruit, peaches; lite caramel malt base; fruit/bitter hop finish.

Enjoy By IPA,"Enjoy by 4/20/18. Canned on 3/14/18.  Pours a clear gold with an orange hue.   Devastatingly dank as the can says, yes, I would agree. This brew is resiny as the dankest dank.   A bit over the top. Straight dankness is not what I look for in a fresh brew, especially as the main component.",0.6333955934032943,3.75,0.891

Citrus rind. Finishes dry.   Feel: Good fizzy carbonation but not overdone. Med-light body.  Overall: On the front end this is one of the nicest DIPA’s available if you crave big hops that lean sweet nectar-y flavors. It does have a bitter bite finish that lingers. I would return to this again whenever craving this particular profile.",0.6687263168313324,4.75,0.891
Black Tuesday,"A: Pitch black with extremely little head that disappears immediately leaving just an outer ring of foam around the glass.  S: This is a monster! Booze blast to the face. Chocolate/vanilla show up to say hey after the booze takes off, but not without wearing out its welcome!  T: BOOZE.. who woulda thought. Port wine, choc/vanilla, fudge, dark fruits. So much going on here. So many different complex taste attributes to this beast of a beer.  M: medium-full body and tingling/numbing booze. Enjoyable to sip on...only to sip on.  O: This is a beer I've always wanted to try, and it almost lived up to the hype but not quite. This beer is a great candidate for consuming with friends as an after dinner drink, or laying down to forget about for a few years. I feel sorry for the poor bastard that tries to take this one down on their own. Share w/ friends.",0.5586187994536171,4.25,0.891

Nectarine Premiere,"On tap at the brewery.  Hazy, murky yellow with no head or lace. The nose is a fruity riot of nectarine. Loaded with jammy, juicy, nectarine with a little acid, this smells great. The base beer is obliterated here. The palate opens very fruity with jammy, juicy, fruity, frothy nectarines a blend of cooked and fresh fruit. Super ripe. The mid palate has a little tartness, some straw, a little honey and vanilla. A touch of white wine is present as well. Long and fruity on the finish with lingering fruit, a little honey and white wine mineral character. This manages to be a layered fruit bomb if you give it a chance. Quite excellent.  **Edit 15 Oct 2016** Drinking a whole bottle, I'm really struck by the intensity of the fruit. Bright, jammy, mildly acidic, mildly tannic, mildly vinous, mild mineral character, moderate lactic and lemon with a mildly raw, mildly sulfury funk. Unlike the draft version, the fruit seems slightly rawer/ less ripe, amplifying the sourness. Excellent stuff.",0.7042381679376426,4.25,0.891
Flora,"Batch 4. Appearance is light gold with good carb. Great smell with some funk that has a bit of a gueuze-like character. Taste is tart, citrusy, and incredibly balanced.

Madagascar,"Pours dark mahogany, settles to almost black in the glass. Not much head or lacing Big vanilla on the nose. Not as medicinal as VR, but about the same level - Vanilla turned to 11, but not much else from the base beer. Big thump of Vanilla milk shake, then nothing. No barrel, no base beer, just vanilla Thin, almost watery mouthfeel even when at room temp  Overall I put this in the same category as Funky Buddha adjunct stouts - really nice, if you are into the kapow! over the top adjunct flavor, but that is all you are getting. Huge nose, but not much else to back it up",0.6354396424248925,3.0,0.8909
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Dorothy is a basic Brett saison and I'm not a big fan of it... This however, is absolutely terrific. One of the best Hill Farmstead saisons I've had. The wine barrels really crank up the flavor. Grapefruit nose, oak, spice, tannins, lemon, orange. So tart and delicious",0.6231106991402063,5.0,0.8909
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Poured from the tap at Dark Lord Day, served in the brewpub inside a tiny snifter. This particular variant of Dark Lord spent time in Heaven Hill bourbon barrels.   Inky black with a teeny tiny head that fizzled away to nothingness. Very thin ring.   Sweet nose. Molasses, light coffee, dark cherry, vanilla, hints of oak. Sugared and syrupy.   Heavy bourbon at first, though the flavor lightens at the swallow. Lots of dark cherries, vanilla, brandy, molasses, hints of coffee, toffee and dark chocolate. Mostly the sweet stuff.   Medium, buttery body expands in the mouth. Oodles of alcohol on the tongue and in the nose. Heavy, syrupy, but not cloying. Fairly clean finish.   I’ve enjoyed the oak-aged Dark Lord in previous years, but this isn’t as smooth as I remember. I might actually prefer the un-aged version, and I definitely prefer the vanilla-aged version.",0.6224309924362561,3.5,0.8909
Oude Geuze Vintage,"2002 yellow label 375ml served at Bier Circus in Bruxelles on August 13 2010.  A: Bright straw colored body with a large white cap. Spotty lacing after a few minutes of slow destruction of the head.  S: Nice lactic tartness. Bright lemon citric notes. Musty oak and a nice wet horse blanket funk.  T: While the nose was quite inviting, the flavor profile just didn't match up. The flavors were a bit muddled and muted. The beer tartness was soft and the flavors never really popped. Age might of been a factor here.  M: Moderate carbonation. Medium body. Nice dry finish. A bit muddled throughout.  D: A good lambic, but not quite deserving of the special labeling. As noted above, age might of been a factor. Looking forward to opening a 2005 yellow label 375ml soon.",0.6700456686118077,4.0,0.8909

Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Drank from a 1 pt 9.4 fl oz corked and caged bottle purchased at Julio's Liquors, Westboro, MA Bottling date 2010, April 28 Served in a wine glass  The beer poured a gorgeous, crystal clear raspberry color. A small, short-lived cap of light pink bubbles topped the liquid. The body bore a striking resemblance to a rose wine.  The nose was equal parts funk/must and sour cherry notes. Lots of barnyard character. Wet hay and damp earth were both apparent. Musty with a strong cellar-like quality. Quite complex and intense.  The taste was a bit more sharp and straightforward than the nose. Tart lemon notes were most noticeable. Quite citric and acidic. Musty, damp and funky. Some vinegar came through on the back end. The bone-dry, oaky finish was super crisp and tart. Slightly tannic. The big letdown however was that there was no discernible cherry flavor.  The beer was medium bodied for the style with a fine yet spritzy effervescence. Snappy and crisp. The liquid turned smooth and creamy once it settled on my palate.  Drie Fonteinen Schaerbeekse Kriek was far more tart and funky than I was anticipating it to be. I really wish my bottle was a bit fresher so that I could have perhaps tasted some of those iconic Schaerbeekse cherries. This was enjoyable but definitely not worth the steep ($38) price tag.",0.6992442708273945,4.0,0.8905
Haze,"Canned 8/1. Deep orange with an inch and a half head that left nice lacing the whole way down the glass. Smell was a bit muted from what I was expecting but you get a nice nose full of papaya and peach plus a hint of grass/onion. Some orange comes out as well but more so from when it is in the can than the glass. Tastes of pine, grapefruit, melon with a bitter backbone. Remarkably smooth despite the bitterness, very soft, modestly carbonated. No way you would know this is 8.2%. No doubt one of the best beers I've had in my life. TreeHouse is a hike for me but, this one was well worth the drive! If you have it, treasure it. If you don't, make the effort to get your hands on this.",0.6748234657951366,4.5,0.8905
Double Orange Starfish,"Moderate pour yields a one inch head over a very hazy body with very nice lacing. Nose of intense tropical fruit, some pine, and citrus.

Aroma of pineapple and mango, deer honey, some pine, lots if citrus fruits and sweet pineapple. Mmm.

Green,"16oz can, stamped 06.29.2016, poured into a Treehouse Teku glass.  The beer pours an expectedly turbid, cloudy and hazy golden color, orange hues with a foamy, thick, taut white head that has very good retention and yields incredible soapy lace. The aroma is very nice, citrusy, juicy with assertive bitter rind, pineapple, hop spice, resinous pine, very earthy with lots of grassiness and some light wildflower. The typical New England yeasty sweetness and light maltiness is totally an afterthought here, pure hoppiness. The flavors are amazing, really powerful tropical fruits, pineapple galore, tangerine and grapefruit juice leads to intensely bitter grapefruit peel and earthy pine sap, grassiness and wildflower again make up the finish with a really nice lingering hop spice flavor with just a touch of mineral water. The mouthfeel is fantastic, full bodied, coating, moderate carbonation, smooth and gentle with a punishingly dry and bitter kick.    Verdict: An absolute gem of an IPA from Treehouse. Certainly one of the more bitter IPAs I've had in a long time, but it has so much flavor that is really complimented by the bitter qualities. This beer certainly lives up to the Treehouse hype, a stunner.",0.6925442669895835,4.25,0.8892

Chocolate Rain,"Many thanks to RipRap for this bottle; yet another beer I felt compelled to track down after mouthing it at a tasting. Big 750ML bottle, vintage 2014, with the trademark Bruery label & gold wax, split with my wife.   The pour is as expected: minimally carbed, and black as the soul of Adrian Peterson with a maple branch in his hand (or a Twitter account). Smells like chocolate milk that’s been doctored with 268 proof something or other: boozy. Not complex or great, but lovely.  Chocolate Rain is something I’d never carry an umbrella for. The first thing I notice is how toasty I am after taking my first sip, as the alcohol burns a warm track all the way down. I hope it doesn’t feel like that coming out. Massive chocolate notes & enough bourbon to sanitize a moderately dangerous wound leap out of the morass. Big-ass vanilla that would have dominated any other beer doesn’t show up until the mid-palate: damn, I’m drunk already. Fudge, oak, gold star maple syrup. The end is all booze & chocolate. Thicker than my…well, thick. Ridiculously drinkable. I’m not sure I would survive taking an entire bottle myself, but damn, I’d like to try. Then try again.   If ever a beer deserved to have the word ‘decadent’ tattooed into its foamy head, it would be C Rain. This is a boozy, chocolate, bourbony, TNT of a beer. It’s also fantastic & fully deserving of… what was I saying? My wife is now speaking tongues. That’s a good sign. Without question a top-shelf beer.",0.5940076868378116,5.0,0.8888
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"A - dark espresso brown/black beer with a mocha head that sticks and leaves a nice lacing. S - interestingly big dark malt, roasted malts, burnt marshmallow, smoke (But I don't think Expy has any smoked malt in it). Definitely some bourbon and barrel character as well but very well balanced with the rest T - big chocolaty, dark/roasted malts, burnt marshmallow, caramel, smoky, vanilla, bourbon Barrel, toasted oak. M - very heavy mouthfeel, alcohol covered, aftertaste is dark roasted malts, umami, very slight bourbon O @ amazing beer. Cannot complain. Bourbon barrel is balanced with the base beer but not overpowering. I love it. I think they should release this every year with the regular expedition. Actually they should both be year round.",0.6258473399497875,4.75,0.8887
Society & Solitude #4,"The pour is a grapefruit milkshake, pale orange, murky, thick, and a light tan head. Aromas are all citrus - oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, pineapple. I am bouncing in my chair.  The taste is dank, citrusy, pungent hops. Just a delight - and a bigger delight is the mouthfeel, which has some bite. I appreciate that much more than the pillowy (i.e., watery) feel so often associated with the style.  World-class beer, IMHO.",0.6521158396744334,4.5,0.8885
Sang Noir,Full and barrely and lovely. Lacto tartness hides the booze beautifully. Blended such that neither the vinous nor the bourbon-y taste wins out. Closer to a classic Flanders Red than expected. Oh boy.,0.5952999268767989,4.5,0.8885
Madagascar,"Pours a shiny black with a small cream colored head. Some lacing around the top of the glass when I gave it a swirl.  Aroma is vanilla first and then bourbon and milk chocolate.  Dominant flavor is vanilla followed by bourbon. Some chocolate and heavy cream. Mild sweetness which increased as the beer warmed. Very smooth drinking and alcohol seems less than the listed 9.3%.  Has the traditional creamy feel of a milk stout though not as thick as some I've had. Low carbonation.  Overall, an outstanding beer which is drinkable enough to get you in trouble at 9.3%.

TASTE: Beer. Just an Old fashioned beer. Touch of mild hoppy flavors, but mostly malty. Some lactose and spice.  FEEL: above average carbonation. Creamy also. Super Smooth.

Madagascar,"Let this guy warm up.  L - pours black with a one finger tan head that leaves minimal lacing around the circumference of the glass. Decent legs.  S - sweet vanilla, bourbon, milk, dark chocolate. Secondary aromas if berries, and molasses, and mild ethenol.  T - very well blended vanilla that does not overpower the slight bourbon, chocolate, or milk. In a world of sweet stouts, this stands out as a lactose stout that is nuanced and the adjunct does not take over the base beer.  F - I think the weakest part of this beer. It is over carbonated that leads to a thin BA stout.  O - this stands out as a well blended stout that show cases the vanilla",0.6353290025203936,4.25,0.8882
Dragonsaddle,"Poured from a 12 oz. can into a Belgian tulip.  Pours a golden orange body with a thin head, leaves plenty of thin lacing inside the glass.  Aromas of dank citrus and alcohol.  Plenty of that dank citrus with mainly oranges and a nice malt sweetness.  Medium mouth feel with a slight alcohol burn.  Overall, a delicious Triple IPA that has an alluring aroma and follows through with a easy drinking body, which is a small problem with that high abv!

It recedes to a similar ring that leaves some splotches here and there.  S: Tartness and mild sourness. A mix of fresh tart fruit, mainly green apple and lemon grass with restrained funk.  T: Gueuze-ish with a slight restrained funk. Tart green apples, lemon grass, mild funk and some oak with a finish of vanilla sweetness that mixes with a little white grape sournes.  M: Zesty and spritzy. The body is light with a refreshing clean finish.  O: Delicious beer that borders on a gueuze IMO. If the funk wasn't so restrained in the backbround I'd say this wasn't a wild ale, but very good none the less.",0.6610422228914911,4.0,0.8874
Chocolate Rain,"***2014 Vintage***   Thanks to F2brewers for this rarity.  Pours thick and viscous, decent head actually which dissipates rapidly. Aroma of fudge predominantly; flavor is bourbon soaked chocolate cake and alcoholic chocolate syrup.  The issue i have is this brew is quite hot and boozy and it's felt in the flavor which overshadows the complexities that are surely there but are lost due to the booziness.  Definitely let this one sit a few years to mellow out. Would be curious to taste an older vintage to see the difference, not likely to happen though :)",0.6252019076074967,4.5,0.8873

S- Lots of delicious raspberry aroma, acidic tartness, wood and musty, earthy funk.  T- Powerful lactic tartness followed by juicy raspberries, slightly bitter raspberry skin. Beneath is a solid layer of musty, horsey funk with wood and tannins.  M- Light-bodied, nice bubbly carbonation, has a super-acidic and dry, tannic feel.  O- A great framboise, it's massively sour, even for Cantillon, which I really like. This is probably the oldest fruit lambic I've had from Cantillon, who I know recommends drinking these young, but even a few years out this is drinking damn nicely.",0.6747008655870486,4.0,0.8871

Smell is very strong pineapple, orange pith, dank green herb, a touch of sweet malt and a tinge of alcohol. Taste is exactly the same. Definitely pineapple forward. Feel is light and juicy with a tinge of alcohol on the finish. Overall a very good beer.

Todd The Axe Man,"L: Pours a mildly hazy, straw-gold, with some particulate floating throughout. Not much of a head on the pour. S: I'm a bit stuffy today, so my smells are a bit muted. Smells a little sweaty with juicy citrus. T: Not extremely bitter on the attack, more of a lingering bitterness. It maintains a very fruity citrus taste throughout. F: Rolls over the tongue and down the hatch without any problem. Definitely one of the most smashable IPA's I've had. O: Fun fact about this beer; This was the very first IPA I ever tried. It was my junior year of college, all I had for beer up to this point was PBR, Bud, Busch, Coors, and Nordeast. I was at a party, and my friend Danny handed me a sample of this stuff.

Black Tuesday,"A - I am actually quite impressed for the ABV that this holds some carbonation, even though short lived resulting in just a mild lace ring I got a 1/8 inch of mocha head. Again I am surprised its not pitch black as it has some ruby hues to that base of the darkness. S - Smell is very inviting of black currant, some port wine, and a heavy dose of bourbon. I can pick up mild notes of cocoa and dark fruits but it's faint. T - WARNING the 2012 batch is boozy as hell. Even when warmed the bourbon notes smack you in the face then sweeten the tongue with one of the most heavy doses of caramel I ever tasted. When I get past the booze (very hard to do) It has an almost marshmallow like candy sweetness (and I love sweet beers) with what can only be described by me is a lashing of sugar plums and licorice. Very little chocolate (I could see why they made a version with cocoa nibs) or roast. As others described it's like a wine and I guess I was born to hate it since I can't stand wine.  M - Heavy if you swish this in your mouth prepare to gag a little bit as the bourbon is one of the most strongest I have ever encountered. As it warms to a near room temperature (55-60 degree's) it's almost unbearable of the level of bourbon.   Overall I shared this with my brother and even though he is not a craft beer drinker he helped me with 8oz of this. As I type I still have 2oz (of my 16) and it's so hard to choke down. I guess it's true that some people rate things higher when they pay the ""rare"" cost.",0.6244969165607881,3.75,0.8861

T: Sweet tropical fruit, notes of grapefruit pith, lemon rind, pineapple, orange, not as sweet as the nose led me to expect.  F: Medium body, smooth carbonation.  O: Finally got my hands on this one, and while it is a very nice IPA, I expected a little bit more based on the hype, it's good but I feel like there are a lot of similar IPAs like it out there.",0.6640937620192804,4.0,0.8861

A slow, deliberate pour summons a white pillowy foam which creeps up the teku but leaves quickly. We are left with a hazy tropical juice. The mouhthfeel is special. So soft. So full of flavor.

Swish,"Pours a extremely hazy golden yellow color with a deep orange hue. The typical haze for dayz appearance on this NE IPA.  Aroma is saturated with bright, overly ripe fruits and a layer of herbaceous dankness. Tons of bright orange, tangerine, orange pith, pineapple, mango, nectarine, and grapefruit.  Taste brings tons of juicy peach and orange up front, along with a good amount of dankness. This transitions into a more tropical vibe of mango and pineapple with that orange and dankness still hanging around. Finishes with orange pith and peel, a grassy and spicy herbaceous quality, and a touch more pineapple juiciness. The citrus pith and herbal bitterness are there, but is not overpowering. A very soft bready malt is there to keep everything in check.  Medium body. Crisp carbonation and creamy. The hop oils are there, but fairly clean overall.  This is right up there with Tree House and Trillium offerings IMO. Tastes similar to Julius with a dash of mary jane dankness. Insanely good stuff.",0.6739076166917001,4.75,0.886

Excellent.",0.6532966962128778,4.5,0.886
Todd The Axe Man,"Canned on 7/5/19  Pours a moderately hazed burnt orange, sizeable, tight, off-white head of foam; great retention yields a massive collar and a lasting dose of thinner, soapy lacing strewn around the glass.  Aroma begins with weedy grapefruit before giving way to a floral, mineral-like quality washing over suggestions of tropical citrus and wild berries.  Taste intersperses pineapple, herbal peach, flaky malt, and floral berries, throughout an evenly balanced profile, with milder notes of dank blueberry appearing sporadically.  Mouthfeel displays a medium body gliding across the palate, with equally moderate carbonation guiding to a light grit on the finish; exceptionally consistent and mildly fluffy; slightly bitter as the swallow sets in.  Delicately floral, tropical, and slightly weedy, this is like Racer 5 met Crusher: an incredibly deep hop experience that stays on the better side of crushable even as it pulls its profile across varying ends of the flavor spectrum.",0.7290964841871648,4.25,0.8858

Society & Solitude #4,"Reviewing Society & Solitude #4 from Hill Farmstead. This might be my favorite IPA that they make, which is to say a lot since Shawn Hill makes some of the best IPA out there.  Score: 97  A week only growler poured and served in to a snifter glass and enjoyed on 08/02/12. This is a backlogged review from notes.  Appearance: Pours a slightly dull, unfiltered orange-peach color with two fingers of off-white head that settles to a thin layer atop the glass. Good oily lacing and retention. 4/5  Smell: Fresh tropical citrus and pine. Loads of grapefruit, mango, pineapple, orange rind and grassy hops. Oh boy! 4.75/5  Taste: Aggressively hopped grapefruit, lemon, and pineapple upfront, which slowly washes away as more of the piney/grassy hops comes through towards the finish with only a hint of lingering tropical flavor on back of tongue. Touch of dirtiness/earthiness on the midpalate to balance out sweet citrus favors too. A near perfect balance is struck here between the sweet and bitter elements, with growing degrees of bitter, slightly dank qualities in the finish as it warms up. 4.75/5  Mouthfeel: Medium-light bodied with a low amount of carbonation that lets the bitterness sit heavy on the tongue. Juicy on the tongue. 4/5  Overall: Yet another knockout IPA experiment from the master. This imperial IPA gives Heady Topper a serious run for its money.   Recommendation: Absolutely seek this one out if/when rebrewed again, unless you hate IPAs.  Pairings: Hawaiian pizza.  Cost: $25 for a 2L growler (including the cost of the container).",0.6835981176037622,4.5,0.8856

T: Lightly tart, slight tannins, raspberry is more restrained than the nose, with a mild sweetness rounding out the flavor.  M: Medium body and medium-light, smoothish carbonation.

The nose on this comes through with pine, mango, grass and hops. Meanwhile the taste, has grains, biscuit, more mango, hops, very nice. It is a tasty beer to be sure.

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"From One-Eyed Betty's BBA Expo event dealie that they had... $6 for a 5.5oz pour never seemed like such a steal until I had this beer.  Usually when I hype a beer up, I'm let down, or I get just what I expected. With this, I just about had my mind blown -- one of the best beers I've had, without a doubt. You'd think, ""Alright. Just another BBA'd imperial stout. I've had a ton of these. How different could it be?""  I wondered the same thing... but this. I don't know. Maybe it's the type of barrels they aged this in, or the wetness of them, or God knows what. Perfectly roasty, chocolatey, bourbony, and smokey, with accents of vanilla and tobacco. If that's not enough, the feel on this is insane. Some beers claim to drink fudge-like, but this one nearly does. I've never had such a viscous stout before, and it works perfectly... because you damn well better believe I want those flavors on my tongue for as long as possible.  Drink this now, now, NOW if you have any bottles. I had it on-tap, but I figure the experience is similar from a bottle... there's just really no reason to let this beer ""mellow out"" or ""cool down"" or any of that shit. Open this beer and enjoy it for what it is, a work of zymurgy magic.",0.5734201722043792,4.75,0.8837
Black Tuesday,"My first BT.  2011 vintage, about time I tried this. Solo.  Look: Semi vigorous pour yields a 3/4 inch head that is gone, but for a ring, in a matter of minutes. After ten minutes, the ring is gone but comes back with a few swirls of the snifter. After 20 minutes the ring can not be brought back. RIP.  Smell: I could smell the booze in this as soon as I lifted the cap. Smells of port soaked raisins, dark chocolate, bitter chocolate. As it warms those raisins are still there but with something new, leather and a distant coffee/espresso essence off in the distance. Raisins dominate.  Taste: Boozy fruit cake, chocolate covered, of course!  Feel: At first I gave it a 4, now at 20 minutes in, 3.75.  Overall: Glad I finally cracked this. I really like beers like this that push the envelope. I will be opening my 2013 sooner rather than later AND with someone else!",0.5795335448711416,4.25,0.8837
Peche 'n Brett,"L: amberish Orange with a fluffy four finger head that dissipates into a one finger head and large patches stuck to the side of the glass S: I could sniff this for hours. Peach in every form - fresh fruit, syrupy, candied/gummy peach. Very clean. T: clean, crisp funk from the Brett, crisp fruitiness from the peach and pear juice, a little malt in the background. A faint hint of tartness.  F: again, crisp and clean with a dry finish O: delicious. Well crafted and executed.",0.6818710095471424,4.5,0.8837
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Now bare with me, I've just started journeying into lambics and sours. On tap along with an Epic line-up @ Novare's It Feels Like Christmas...  Poured a bright red hue that produced a pink froathy head that disappeared rather quickly to show some decent lacing.  Now the face my girlfriend made when she smelt this was classic. Tart raspberries up front. Loads of acidic viniger and some great fruity yeast aromas.  Wow almost like sucking on a war head as I heard someone say. Loads of overwhelming sour raspberries slap you in the mouth. Again acidic flavors poking through, little citrus, finished with a refreshing mouth puckering sourness  Mouthfeel was puckering and tart. Decent carbonation and dry finish.  This is a sipper...",0.6572315172788876,4.0,0.8836
Beatification,"Either a Batch #5 bottle straight from RR or from Arbitrator, not sure. Poured into a Hill Farmstead tulip.  A - Pours a yellow with a hint of orange, which can be seen right through. A thick head at first, a goes down a little. Looks really fantastic.  S - Crisp and slightly tart with a funk. Hint of lemon zest and a sliced green apple.   T - Tartness upfront lays way to more tartness. Much like the aroma, actually, with more of the sour coming through in the flavor. There is lemon zest, some other light notes of very light fruits (apples, peach), some funkiness evident in well-blended gueuzes. The oak can be noticed behind the sourness after a few sips.  M - Lighter and crisp, which is perfect for the style.  O - This is a remarkably good AWA. It makes me think of a young gueuze blend more than any non-fruited AWA I've had. For a style that strives to be as good as something out of Belgium, RR has done it here. I find it to be slightly less layered and complex than the best gueuze I've had, but not by much.",0.693876900576465,5.0,0.8836
Society & Solitude #4,"Straight from a growler I picked up at the brewery on October 19, 2016 and drank that night.   An orange pale yellow color. A little over one finger white head that faded slowly leaving some lacing.   The smell is fruity citrus with some spicy scent. I taste more tangerine in this one.   Some acidic body and more carbonated than necessary.   The tangerine and hops goes great together. A world-class beer with a great bitter finish. Hill Farmstead is becoming one of my favorite breweries.",0.6275382493426533,5.0,0.8834
Enjoy By IPA,"Probably my favorite non vintage stone beer along with Xocoveza. An accessible cream of the crop west coast double IPA. I didn't try the chocolate version, but I know others who have.

Sang Noir,"Small snifter pour at Haymaker.  A- Auburn liquid with a light khaki head. Streaks of film and lace. 4.75  S- Smells like tart cherries with hints of dark malt. Bold cherry is cool. 4.25  T- Sour/tart pulpy cherries. Caramelized sugar and bready, almost chocolatey malts. Hints of vanilla and truly an orchard type of funk. 4.25  M- Tart approaching aggressively sour, but never hits that enamel-peeling quality. Some prickliness and almost vinegar qualities before a dry and vinous finish. 4  Something I've wanted to try for ages. A $13 pour still seems better than a $40 bottle. Good stuff.",0.6488211615696026,4.25,0.8834

Aroma - Nose is orange, earthy herbal hops, grapefruit  Taste - Taste is mostly orange nice balanced sweetness and light bitterness. Grassy hops and pineapple come out well, taste is sweeter than the nose let's on.  Feel - Medium bodied good carbonation little thinner than expected but I blame that on teh alcohol which you cannot find very well hidden.  Overall - I am fine with the nose great flavors little thin not much head.",0.6892711295149153,4.25,0.8834
Darkstar November,"Pours thick and dark with a nice tan head. Lots of carbonation. Smell of chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon.

Beatification,Batch 5:  Pours a light golden hue with a slight haze. An immediate effervescent fireworks starts occurring in the glass with the tiny bubbles radiating to the quarter inch frothy head.   Smell is a funkadelic sour and citrus mix. Just a beautiful aroma that reeks of complexity.  So after the first sip you realize the hype is legit. A wonderful marriage of a lemon and sour funk that is smooth but complex just like the aroma. An optimal amount of pucker that is balanced with an almost chardonnay quality that dances in your mouth.  Overall this a phenomenal wild. I would describe the experience as an erection for the taste buds.,0.7049429259386187,4.5,0.8834
Peche 'n Brett,"Fresh batch (couldn't read date, but was just distro'ed)   Pours a pale straw with haze Strong brett on the nose, with faint stonefruit, but peach is lost in the background Brett is dominant, not much else makes it through except alcohol heat on the finish Light spritz with good carb, body hides its ABV well  Overall a nice beer, but not worth the $27 a bottle.",0.6237873573674885,3.5,0.8834
Todd The Axe Man,"Poured from a 1 pint can into a Shaker pint glass, ""canned on"" date 3-7-18.  APPEARANCE: pours a hazy, orange color with less than one-finger tan head that quickly dissipated until a thin, broken layer of small bubbles remained, there is light lacing on the glass, medium carbonation.  SMELL: bread and tropical citrus, there is also a dank, musty note.  TASTE: initially dank and musty, then the sweet tropical citrus taste and bread.  PALATE: medium body and carbonation.  OVERALL: this is an excellent beer from an excellent brewer, I have not had a bad beer from these guys, I enjoyed this beer very much but.....it's a little pricey, glad I tried it but not really in my budget as a go to beer, I would recommend to anyone who enjoys the style and does not care about value.",0.6612217700527601,4.5,0.8831
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"2014 vintage  L - Pitch black on all fronts. A finger of brown head with no lacing.  S - Bourbon is so huge even after one year. A tinge of alcohol. Milk chocolate, cherries, and oak.  T - Bourbon and a pure alcohol taste clash, but it isn't exactly ""hot"". Lacks the usual chocolate, coffee, and overall roasty notes from stouts. Bourbon does lend a subtle sweetness and there is some oak to be had, but overall this is falling flat.  F - Thick enough I guess, but a far cry from what you'd expect from a massive 11% barrel-aged imperial stout. some touches of alcohol, but they don't burn. It actually might be too clean on the finish.  O - It's an ok BA stout, but not worthy the money. Many, MANY other Ba stouts are more readily available and are better in overall quality. Seriously, if I find out you spent $30+ on this I will come to your home and slap you.",0.6258047263209394,3.75,0.883
Juicy,"Bottle pour at the tasting at la casa de dirtinabottle.   It slowly gurgles out of the bottle after opening, needs to settle for a second before we open it. It's alive!  Pours a dark peach color, with a one inch head, and small little dots of lacing.  Just an incredible fresh fruit touch in the aroma- melon, orange, pineapple, lemon, some white wine.  The taste is similar, but the funk has clearly taken over the proceedings at this age. Fruity, slightly chalky Brett flavors abound, some barnyard funk, light acidity, melon, orange, pineapple, lemon, white wine acidity. A little bit of hop presence is tasted near the end, of the zesty, citrusy variety. Lingering acidity.  Medium bodied, juicy but crisp mouthfeel. For all the flavors, this is quite drinkable.  One of the most interesting and well-crafted beers I've ever had. Shaun Hill is a genius.",0.6839542687883459,4.5,0.8829
Enjoy By IPA," by 04.20.18, 355ml can poured into a snifter.  Transparent orange amber color with thick creamy off-white head with good retention, the head gradually collapses to a long-lasting foamy crown and leaves some lacing behind clinging on the glass-side.  The aroma is purely a hop burst. Intense tropical, citrus, bitter orange, tangerine, peach, papaya, lime, dank, pine, and heavily resin that are back by sweet malt at the back end.  Fresh and intense hoppiness through the palate sensation, tropical fruit, citrus, bitter orange, tangerine, peach, papaya, lime, dank, pine, and heavily resin just like the aroma plus with solid bitterness lingering at the end. Malt is there too as the sweet support.  Medium body with some bold touch through the palate, the mouthfeel is smooth with rather low carbonation but proper to carry all the things well. Finish is typically dry.  Super fresh and devastatingly hoppy. Drink now as soon as you can.",0.692348719476728,4.5,0.8829
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"I finally got to try Bourbon Barrel Aged Oro Negro and it was great. It lived up to the hype. It is brewed with Walnuts, conditioned on spices and Aged in Bourbon Barrels. What an explosion of flavors. It is a wonderful stout.  Look: Black with a thin mocca colored head  Aroma: roasted malts, chocolate, nuts, bourbon.  Taste: Roasted malts, walnuts, a little bit of chili peppers, chocolate, some coffee, and very distinct nice bourbon.  Body/Overall: full body, creamy, silky, smooth",0.6389760307259765,4.75,0.8828

Chocolate Rain,"Absolutely amazing.  Got as part of a trade for a Sede Vacante from a local friend.  Very dark, almost no carbonation, super smooth. HUGE amounts of chocolate.

Well done Pipeworks.",0.6763651216154071,4.75,0.882
Madagascar,"A: Pours an impenetrable brown with a thin cap of dark brown head that dissipates almost immediately to a thin persistent ring.   S: Dark chocolate, a bit of cinnamon, nuts, earth, vanilla bean, light roastiness, and moderate bourbon.   T: Very bourbon and cola forward, more so than the aroma and also not quite as complex, along roast that is overshadowed by medium sweetness, light vanilla bean, and some lingering coffee on the finish.   M: Medium-full bodied with light carbonation. Mild alcohol warmth but not boozy or hot.   O: Solid effort, but a few notches below top tier. Reminds me a bit of the less elegant BB stouts (like CW BBBW, Arcadia BA Shipwreck Porter). Pretty bourbon and cola forward and not quite balanced enough by the vanilla or base beer.",0.672360149665578,4.25,0.8819
Dragonsaddle,"Powerfully strong on the alcohol side for an IPA and with a residual sweetness that tames the spice nearly perfect, Hoof Hearted's ""triple IPA"" rips out of the can kicking and screaming.  Dragonsaddle hits the nose with a host of fruit-forward aromatics, leading with sharp citrus then bridging toward tropical exotics and finally landing in orchard territory -all ahead of a taste that washes the palate with caramel malts, and then toasty and nutty counterparts.  But the taste really evolves over the middle palate as the sweetness is maticulously picked apart by hops. What rises in its wake are vibrant citrus flavors of pink grapefruit, curracau orange liquor and lemon before diving further into exotic pineapple, mango, kiwi and passionfruit. Not to be ignored, there's the apple, pear and melon character that reaches from the depths and strives for meek attention. Yet its the bitterness of pine and citrus that outlasts the finesse fruit, ...along with that severe acetone bitter bite that's tucked nicely behind the hops.  Medium-full in texture, the beer's weight is more than standard IPA but a far cry from malt-forward imperial ale. Dragonsaddle retains a medium sweetness that persists and aids in the offset of the bulk of the beer's spicy alcohols and absurd hop additions. What's left in aftertaste is citrus, solvent and freshly shaven spruce.",0.6993133780697207,4.25,0.8818
Sip Of Sunshine,"Aroma is so bright with big resinous hop flowers with pineapple, mango and apricots. Palate is full of flavour and beautifully balanced. A hop flower fruitiness drives the palate with a nice dry bitter finish. Some very light malty sweetness is there but leaves the hops at the forefront. A really good balance between the more extreme haze juice bombs and the west coast style.",0.7073194930663986,4.75,0.8818
Green,"From fresh 2 yeek old can. Thanks Ed! Classic NE look, very hazy straw color, creamy head. Smells very potent, lots floral notes. Taste is semi bitter, slightly sweet and lots of unique hoppy flavors I can't pinpoint. Not as much Citrus as I'd expect but it's there in the ballence. Mouth full and feel is great, creamy, thick resonis. Overall this IPA is as good if not better then its hype. Extreamly crushable yet thick and full bodied. 7.5% can't tell till the end.

Thicket,"Blend #2. 2019 release.  A: Pours a deep burgundy, nice clarity and effervescence, with a cap of fizzy purplish-pink head that dissipates rapidly leaving a still surface. No lacing.  S: Blackberry, grape juice, and light oak effortlessly meld with a medium-light barnyard funk.   T: A bracing, medium-high, Warhead-like sourness that (fortunately) tapers off quickly. Blackberry juice, medium-light sweetness, and mild funk round out the palate.   M: Fizzy, light body with medium-high, crackly carbonation.  O: Great fruit character.

Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Citrus, tropical, turbid. Revisited this beer after a long gap since last I tried it. My palate has come a long way (and racked up many a hop-beating) since, but my impression still stacks up: ultra hopped, super tropical, pungent but so soft and smooth throughout. I'm not a fan of the turbid OJ pour and this is the archetype of the style. From there it's all tropical fruit - guava, passion orange, papaya, pineapple - ovrlayed on a malt base that holds up quite well. Barely any bitterness; completely unbalanced.",0.6909109863391381,4.25,0.8811
Black Tuesday,"(Reviewing a 2014 bottle)  Pretty much a perfect example of the style. Ink black, smooth, not to sweet.

Flora - Blueberry,"Reviewing Blueberry Flora from the Hill Farmstead Brewery out of Greensboro, Vermont.  Score: 87   February 2014 vintage bottle from the June 2014 release, served in a stemmed Hill Farmstead taster glass and enjoyed on 08/06/14. Thank you Paul for the chance to tick this one!  Appearance: Pours a murky blueberry juice purple color, with a thin layer of head that completely settles. No lacing or retention, with a little residual oiliness that clings to the sides of the glass. 4/5  Smell: Blueberries and oak. A hint of citrus, and a little bit of wine/tannic character on the back half of the whiff. Some blue cheese/yogurty funk too. 3.75/5   Taste: Tart, but delicate blueberry flavor throughout. A hint of lemon zest upfront, with a wine flavored finish. Has a bit of that cheesy/yogurt funk lingering on the finish too, which I do not love, but which is also not pronounced enough to ruin the beer. Notes of oak and wheat on the finish too, increasingly so as it warms, masking much of the funk. 3.75   Mouthfeel: Light-medium bodied, appropriately carbonated. Has a delicateness to the sourness, without much acidity, though the finish is like a white wine with a mild tannic character. A little bit creamy on the mouthfeel. The dregs of the bottle make the last sips super dry. 4.5/5  Overall: This beer is complex and has an excellent mouthfeel, but I would prefer more blueberry fruitiness/tartness and less funk. I much prefer a blueberry sour more in the vein of Blueberry Flanders to this brew (though they are entirely different creatures).  Cost: $20 for a 500 ml bottle.",0.6850002166641117,4.75,0.8806

Smells incredibly peachy, fresh, slightly tart peaches, along with some lemon and acidity.  One dimensional taste, but a good taste nonetheless. Peach and sour tartness. Some lemons, too, maybe, tiny bit of oak.  Very highly carbonated, cuts down on some on the pucker factor. Light to medium bodied, crisp mouthfeel.

Vicinity,"Poured from a can (canned 7/12) on 7/12 into a snifter. Hazy beautiful pour, medium-large head that quickly dissipates on a moderately aggressive pour, smells similar to Trillium's Congress St. IPA, peaches mangos etc., with slight boozy and metallic hints, tastes like a less fruity Congress St. with more of a bitter piney afterbite, feel is crisp but almost watery which is surprising given the clear hop presence. Overall this was everything I expect from Trillium's hoppy beers -juicy and delicious! I completely and respectfully disagree with the ""bros"" rating. Ironically, the staff published on rating beers specifically advising against rating beer that was sampled at a tap as factors such as noise, setting, etc. might influence the perception. Further, tapping a keg at row 34 or anywhere else does not guarantee freshness or consistency across sampling.

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Brought to me in line at the 2010 DLD while in line by a very generous gentleman.   The oak aged DL pours jet black with a small ebony head that quickly fades and leaves no lacing. Smell is chocolate, sugar and LOTS of oak. The wood characteristics dominate all other aspects of this beer. The taste is similar to the nose with Oak up front, some chocolate malts and nuts in the middle, followed by a wood finish. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. Great tasting stout but I agree with others in that the oak may be just too much. It is a great cousin of Dark Lord but not sure I could handle much more than the small sample I received.",0.6328944351362836,4.5,0.8794
Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"On tap at SARA. Pours a nice deep straw color, totally opaque, with a filmy white head. Fresh grains abound in the aroma with subdued fruity touches of banana, peach and orange. Similar flavor, grainy malt base with a creamy vanilla-banana note and mild stone fruit. Light tartness throughout. A very nice, basic saison, really easy to drink but at the same time flavorful and rewarding. Brings to mind Odonata saison.",0.6969493146710698,4.0,0.8792
Aaron,"The beer comes in a lighter mahogany.  The beer hits up front of a medium plus sweetness of brown sugar, light caramel, bourbon sweetness. The beer slows down on the mid palate with a subtle bourbon quality, vanilla, a toasty malt quality.  The beer is clean, subtle, and refined, just as expected. It could explode with more richness, but still one of the better bourbon barrel barleywines out there.",0.6854271298571765,4.75,0.8792

T- tart citrus followed by cherries (tart but also a simblance of pie filling), granny smith apple, with some light vinegar at the finish.  M- medium body and light carbonation. Very mellow and drinkable for a sour, not a ton of acidity like most.  O- 5/10 sourness. Very mellow sour that is insanely drinkable with the 7 years on it. Nice cherry flavors and aromas.

Caffè Americano,"Lifted this 22 oz. bottle from a beer museum in River Falls, WI, & I’m sure it has no idea how it got there. Split with my wife.   Black. Nose much milder than expected, a bit of roast & sweetness, little else.   Caffe’ Americano is a boozy punch to the forebrain. More balanced than most CC stouts, this has equal portions of vanilla, roast, espresso, sweetness, all with a sturdy shot of alcohol & a finish of light chocolate. Big, brawny. No problem at all to put away half of this bottle.   Not quite up to the Valhalla-high standards of CC, but this is a stout that I would never be unhappy to find in a glass, or doing keg stands with. Very good beer.",0.6342563009911597,4.0,0.8789
Chocolate Rain,"Clear mahogany with red edges and a fuzzy tan head that fizzles out quickly to a thin ring at first, then to nothing at all, ending up like glass of dark rum--the surface appears sticky and slick, and a swirl leaves clear legs on the glass. Those legs stay damn near permanently which I don't think I've ever seen in a beer before today.  Smell is chocolate syrup, maple syrup, vanilla, bourbon and oak. It gives off an overall sweet aroma, developing into full on brownie batter in no time at all.  First sip brings candied almonds with brown sugar, maple syrup, chocolate syrup, vanilla, bourbon and oak. It honestly tastes like a brownie dipped in bourbon--and it sure is hot as red coals just like that would be. I'd have to say I prefer actual brownies, but this isn't a bad second. Some smokey date arises in the aftertaste.  Slick, sticky and thin to medium bodied with an obviously hot, numbing swallow and a semi-wet, sharp, mildly carbonated finish. And I'm sure you won't be surprised by this next bit, but it's also hot on the exhale.",0.6262298791364204,4.0,0.8786
Beer:Barrel:Time,"B2. About as perfect of a BA stout as you can get. Barrel hits your nose as soon as you pop the bottle. Although there are no adjuncts, you pick up massive notes of fudge and vanilla in the taste. Barrel is very present but doesn't overwhelm the other flavors. Feel is the best I've had in a stout....thick, moderately low carbonation, coats the tongue, with no burn. Fantastic.",0.6538682014974933,5.0,0.8786
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of floral coffee notes with some black chocolate note and some subtle bourbon notes.

Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Eclipse 2015 - Elijah Craig Look: Half inch of dense foam. A little bit of lacing. It fizzes up a bit when you tilt it side to side. Nice-looking stout, but it doesn't have the typical BA stout look to it. 4.0 Smell: Tons of bourbon and cocoa powder and an oaky spiciness to it with a bit of dark fruit in the background. Subtle and layered. 4.25 Taste: Follows through with the bourbon and cocoa, and the oak barrel is still assertive. Some bitter hops on the finish balance it out. 4.0 Mouthfeel: Nice stickiness but not the fullest body. 3.75 Overall: A great BA stout. 4.0",0.6829110954622308,4.0,0.8779

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Poured into the lil' plastic cup, with a dark ass body, a nice thick head, and no chance of sun escaping from it. The nose was coffee rich, slight chocolate, but heavy on the bourbon. The tongue has everything you'd expect from a Dark Lord, smoother on the hop,but very rich chocolate, a nice roasted coffee flavor, but once again, a lot of bourbon. I had a bit of a difficulty drinking this one down, the alcohol burn was a bit much for me, I think the beer could do well just aging in a barrel as opposed to a bourbon barrel, that's my two cents though.",0.6063051523834152,3.0,0.8779

Definitely see the Cantillon influence on this one.",0.6856021060281366,4.5,0.8779
Nelson,"Poured from a howler on the day it was tapped. A vigorous pour produces a thick, creamy, light tan, two finger head on top of an orangish tan, slightly opaque beer. The smell knocks you over with fresh citrus and woody/piney hops. There is also a spiciness to it. The taste is bitter hops resin, and a woody, floral spice. The citrus comes through less on the taste than in the nose. The mouthfeel is velvety and smooth. Overall a great beer I'm happy I had the chance to try. It's a unique flavor.",0.6779025089682501,4.25,0.8779

Grapefruit is the main flavor, with underlying flavors of tropical fruits and pine. Slight bitterness with some sticky hop resin. Very soft mouthfeel. Another great Trillium hoppy beer",0.6762438227087935,4.5,0.8779

Exceptional, probably the best DIPA I have had to date.",0.6900477001447975,4.75,0.8779
Society & Solitude #4,Pours cloudy gold with a sticky 3 finger white head. Good retention and lacing.  Strong mango aroma. Loads of citrus and papaya as well.  Tropical fruits also shine through a lot in the flavor. I get a lot of mango and also some pineapple along with a resiny lingering finish. Juicy fruit lingers on the tongue.  Medium mouthfeel with medium carbonation levels. Just a kiss of alcohol present even at 8%  Typical home run from Hill Farmstead. I could drink this one all day despite the higher ABV.,0.6709578036527479,4.5,0.8779

Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"750ml bottle, served in a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass. Pours a hazy golden yellow body, one finger thick head, short retention, bits of lacing. Typical HF saison appearance. Smells of grapefruit and citrus, more of a hop aroma, light bitterness and a bit of white wine sweetness and must. Light funk. Bits of oak. Flavour brings out more dry white wine grape, nice mustiness, light farmhouse funk, oak, and light acidity with a more grapefruit zesty bitterness. Very solid. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, good carbonation, light and bitter citrus and saison yeast on the finish. Smells like a Hill Farmstead IPA, but with more of a white wine twist and complexity to it. It's not necessarily one of the better saisons from this brewery, but for what it is, it is very nice.",0.6897333673638997,4.25,0.8778
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Thanks to cosmicevan for sharing!  Decent looking, nothing special here though. Strong, smooth bourbon aroma takes over to blend with roasty malts and sugary sweetness.  The underlying taste is a more mature version of DL complimented by sweet, smooth, rounded bourbon. Not too much complexity here: just bourbon. Cognac DL was much more interesting, and a significantly better variant overall.  Still a great beer, but a big step down from the Cognac in my book. But then again, I'm not a bourbon lover.",0.6917189903805763,4.5,0.8778
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Thanks to a prior trader for hooking me up. Shenanigans ensued with the procurement/bottling of this beer, I'm sure.  Pours a dark black, some deep tan bubbling froth, and a bit of a foamy crust.   Smells like ... Dark Lord. I feel like cutting and pasting my review. Hmmm ... Chocolate, dark fruits, a roasted malt backing. So far, not much oak.  Well, the oak makes its appearance in the flavor, in a big ... kind of distracting way. Vanilla, bourbon-y oak, and the familiar chocolate, roasted malt, and velvety dark fruit of the base Dark Lord. They laid a heavy -bal aging on this beer. And yes, there's more than a bit of sherry to it. Thick, viscous, and creamy. Noticeable bourbon component.  Much better on my second sampling.",0.6474504846347828,4.5,0.8777

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"I was at DLD 2008 and tasted the Bourbon and the vanilla bean DL on tap.  The Bourbon barrel DL, was really amazing. It is not something I would drink every day (even if I could).

Swish,"I'll admit, I'm not big on the super cloudy look. This one is very hazy with almost a sediment look. It doesn't affect smell or taste though. Smell is very piney, a bit on the dank side.

Not overpowering, but there is a slight bitterness, which was great to cut through the citrus. I really enjoyed this.",0.6629278619905129,4.5,0.8776
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"The beer poured a nice, pleasant color. The smell was a little intriguing at first, though I had never tried this type of beer before.

Overall, excellent beer.",0.6946330330778291,4.75,0.8768
Swish,"Canned 4 days ago.  L — Haze for days of the likes of Trillium’s brews. It has this whitish-hued milkiness that offsets the orange more than NEIPAs coming out of other breweries. Some retention and minimal lacing S — Very dank and pungent. Mango, pineapple, weed, papaya, guava, peach, apricot, green onion, touch of bready malts. The mosaic shines on this one	 T — Straight tropical fruit juice (esp. passionfruit and pineapple) alongside a yeasty bite, citrus rind/herbaceous hop bitterness, and faintly sweet bready malts. More bitter than anticipated at the start of the sip, but most of it drops off at the tail end.  F — Crisp, with a decently prevalent yeast character. Medium mouthfeel, medium carb.  O — Punchy NEIPA offering from Bissell that is certainly on par with a lot of what’s coming out of Trillium and other ‘new-age’ hoppy breweries. The mouthfeel and overall clarity doesn’t hold a candle to Tree House, though. Fair pricing @$17/4-pack of 16oz cans from the brewery  91/100",0.683100635083603,4.5,0.8766

The beer gets more and more hazy as the sediment is slowly introduced into the glass.  Horse blanket and citrus. Old cheese and gym socks, with a little bit of grapefruit and lemon zest. Fills the room with it's aroma.   Opens up with tart citrus zest, then moves quickly into the funk. Horse blanket, hay stacks, moldy cheese and gym socks all come together. Awesome, lactic sourness in this blend too. Pretty balanced and enjoyable as well.  Medium bodied with a soft, fluffy mouth feel and effervescent carbonation. A tad sticky on the lips, and drying on the palate.  Great balance of funk and citrus. A stellar example of a proper blend of gueuze, in the same ballpark as Lente if you ask me. I hope to encounter this one again, but the price and way it's acquired deters me a bit.",0.6801940465505093,5.0,0.8765

Medium bodied, slightly bitter, and juicy. Heads and tails above most beers I have had, but behind Julius and Haze in my Tree House order. Worth seeking out and an amazing IPA.

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"A: Pours a pitch black color with a small tan head  S: Huge notes of bourbon and roasted malt with lots of dark chocolate, coffee, and caramel.

Coffee comes through underneath. Decadent. Finishes with lingering bourbon, oak, and roast  M: Full bodied with moderate carbonation. A little dry and tongue-coating  O: An incredible BBA stout that makes for a great sipper. This builds on the base and makes it both a bourbon and chocolate malt bomb (in the best way possible). Definitely worth tracking down",0.6343709854445809,4.75,0.876

Juicy,Poured out as a hazy orange yellow color with a thin head on top. The smell of the beer was a little hoppy but had a subtle wine barrel funk on the nose as well. The taste of the beer had a subtle tartness to it along with a decent bitter finish. The feel was thicker than I expected.

Enjoy By IPA,"Look: Clear, and deep gold in color. The two-finger white head disappears right away, likely due to the high ABV.   Smell: Bready malt mixes with honeysuckle and a somewhat tart, meaty smell. It's not stomach-turning, but it certainly doesn't hit the spot. Makes me wonder if I'm too close to the end-date? In the background, light citrus hops are subdued by caramel.   Taste: Once the palate grows used to the intense taste of honey and butterscotch, resinous hops and a soft, bready malt make their presence known. In spite of the sweet notes, there's a moderate bitterness accentuated by spicy peppercorn.   Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel with moderate carbonation and a creamy, satiny finish which still retains some dryness.   Overall: The well-balanced taste is the highlight here, and while it's not a mind blowing beer, it's delicious enough to be undeniably worth drinking.",0.7076739650363782,4.0,0.875

This is my current favorite beer, if you have a chance to taste any of the Russian River sours try this one first, it will blow your mind.",0.5618142304943616,5.0,0.875
Todd The Axe Man,"Pours a cloudy amber colour. Smells like grapefruit, hops, sweet malts, a bit boozy, but balanced. Tastes like sweet malts, grapefruit, grapefruit rind, pithy, and a bit alcoholic. Very balanced and drinkable for such a big beer.",0.6751094424140941,4.0,0.875
Swish,"Pours a hazy, orange-juice color with a decent white head. Leaves an OK amount of lacing.   The aroma is very citrus forward but has a nice balance. I get notes of grapefruit and mango, as well as notes of what I can only describe as dank ass kush. Not what I expect from a top-notch New England DIPA but it's a pleasant aroma nonetheless.   The taste is very tropical, with notes of tangerine, mango, and even something I can only assume is lime. It's well-balanced as well, as the doughy malt and lingering pine bitterness provide a very nice backbone.  The feel is medium bodied with decent carbonation. Alcohol is non-existent. Nice and creamy with a bitter character lingering after every sip.   Overall, a very good DIPA. It's creamy, hoppy as hell, and well-balanced. A bit overpriced and perhaps not worth waiting in line for 3 hours for, but still very good.",0.7120785932077068,4.25,0.8749
Beatification,"B6 poured in December 2015. Crystal clear yellow color. The nose is a beautiful blend of sour, citrus, and funk. The taste is strongly funk with a good sour bite.

Sip Of Sunshine,"$ 18.78 (Including tax and deposit) for four-pack of 16 oz cans ($ 0.293/oz) at Alkies, Massena, NY. Reviewed 7/23/19. Bottom of can stamped “PKGD 26JUN19”. Carried on ice in cooler for 24 hours then served in a shaker. Stored in cooler in store. Appearance – 4.25. First pour – Light yellow, clear. Body – Gold, slight haze. Head – Large (Maximum 8.5 cm, aggressive center pour), white, medium density, good retention, diminishing to an irregular five to twenty mm lacy crown and a rocky partial layer. Some irregular islands of lacing remain as the head retracts. Lacing – Excellent! As the level drops, multiple unconnected irregular bands of extremely tiny to small bubbles remain. See also above. Aroma – 4 – Piney. Flavor – 4.25 – Distinctly bitter with a predominantly resinous taste with hints of pine. As it warms, some malt backbone begins to appear. No alcohol taste or aroma (8 % ABV), no diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide.  Palate – 4 – Full, creamy, lively carbonation. Impression and interpretation – 4.25 – Very tasty and somewhat filling.",0.6830706917575531,4.25,0.8748

Chocolate Rain,This beer had big expectations for me. Then it blew every single one of them away. I had the 2013 vintage. It instantly became a favorite of mine. Strong chocolate and slight vanilla give this brew the taste of a chocolate bar. The 18% abv(2013) wasn't that noticeable. This is serious perfection in a bottle!,0.5940713614026122,5.0,0.8748
Beatification,"Single finger fizzy white head on a slightly hazy pale golden body. Aroma of Chardonnay, white grapes, lemon zest, funk, tropical fruit and nicely forbodes the level of tartness the taste has in store. The first sip has the salivary glands contracting and it's so tart initially it is almost bad but it's just enough to be perfect. As you get used to it the flavors pop with lemon, white wine, fruits, Chardonnay and Granny Smith sour apples. Oak is light. It's only knock for me is it lacks a little complexity likely because it is so tart the other flavors are lost. Crisp, light body with the sourness drying you out quite a bit. Another great sour from RR. Lives up to the hype and beyond.",0.6890580958286876,4.75,0.8748
Sure Bet,"Hazy orange pour with two fingers of dense white head. Good lacing down the glass. Quite simply, the aroma is incredible. The mango unquestionably hits you first, I smelled it the second I started pouring. With that you get the citrus and tropical smells you expect from citra/mosaic. On the taste, it reverses, the hops take charge with plenty of citrus and juiciness. The honey and mango add a sweetness and balance out the hop character. Mouthfeel is a smooth medium-full body with medium carbonation. There is a lingering bitterness of the back of the tongue. I have to say, this is my favorite Pipeworks, which is an impressive feat!",0.6939534052603861,4.75,0.8748
Black Tuesday,"I'm a bit disappointed in the merely dark brown body and dinky head (hey, it's 20%). I'm not disappointed in the port-like aroma. Subtle undertones of nuanced bourbon (think vanilla, banana, marshmallow, and even coconut) coexist with intense dark fruit qualities. It's a great nose, though it doesn't quite floor me the way I expected. The flavor profile indeed reveals many similarities to port. It opens with incredible tones of fig, raisin, currant, apricot, cherry, plum, and peach. Around the middle is where the bourbon flavors appear. It ends with a powerful (but complex) malt sweetness, some umami, and an also significant alcohol presence. Though the booze is somewhat harsh, it also creates layers of nuance that help compensate for the insane sweetness. Somewhat. The palate is coated with a ton of residual sugar, and that makes it a SLOOOW sipper. Even a tiring one. I have even more qualms about the somewhat thin and firm feel - it's not well suited to the flavor profile. Still, the zesty carbonation IS suited to the aforementioned thin, firm texture, helping to cleanse the palate ever-so-slightly. I really dig many aspects of this, and it's one of the most complex brews I've ever sampled...but I doubt I could even drink half a bottle. It's just way too sweet, boozy, and over the top at the end of the day. I doubt I'd trade for this again, but I'm happy to have finally tried it.  3.73/5: Insert diabeetus reference here",0.7275136995349998,3.5,0.8747

Society & Solitude #4,"Thanks!  Pretty standard HF IPA appearance: cloudy, milky pale amber body with two fingers of lasting head. The nose is a cornucopia of tropical fruit, with papaya, mango, pineapple and a touch of stone fruit. Really impressive hop aroma that nearly overwhelms the malt backbone. The palate offers more of the same, great pineapple, stone fruit and mango flavors that lead into a clean but assertive bitterness. There's a touch of crackery malt beneath. Really impressive stuff.",0.6999180154325187,4.5,0.8744
Aaron,"Picked up four bottles at the Brewery in early September. Plan is to crack one per year to see how this baby ages out.  A- darker then most barleywines with a nice thick head.  S- aroma is huge. Wow. What's the abv on this one? Not on the bottle. Smells like the abv is 15% or more. Nice hints of vanilla, maybe raisins and some bourbon.  T- Holy cow. Dark, fruity and boozy. This here is a sippin beer and will be the only beer for tonight.   M- perfectly balanced beer with so much going on. Carb is spot on.  O- huge complex beer with tons of flavor and booze. Maybe a bit too boozy but I'm not complaining.

Mastermind,"I gave this beer a perfect sore because it did everything I wanted to in terms of what I think should be.  Look was hazy orange with a nice fluffy head.   Aroma was out of this world. Just like Double Sunshine with no alcohol presence.  Flavor is as juicy as biting into an orange and then sipping on a glass of pineapple juice. So flavorful without being sweet. Was rather dry; that's just how I like them.  Mouthfeel was soft in terms of carbonation and bitterness wasn't aggressive or off-putting.

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"2 oz. of the 2011 Bourbon variant on-tap at DLD on April 27th, 2013. Thanks to Wes for giving us his second glass, otherwise we'd have missed out entirely.  A - Basically identical to the regular version. Perhaps a tad more of that rich oil coating.   S - Plentiful bourbon whiskey melding over raisins, fudge, batter, pencil shavings, and sherry.  T - Dense oak that's been super-saturated with bourbon (albeit slightly generic). Deep cocoa, honey graham cracker, molasses, prune, and massive raisin.   M - Medium-heavy body, carbonation low enough to not be immediately detectable, dry finish.   D - Few base beers change as much in a barrel as Dark Lord. I certainly appreciate the transportation and would never decline a taste.",0.6431606787299956,4.75,0.8739

It was a marriage made in heaven. I discovered Weihenstephaner back in the States and also found their Helles Lager. What a pour! Yellow and cloudy with an absolute thick creamy head. The taste is a mixture of banana and cloves and hangs in there for every swallow. It is actually GREAT! Added to their Helles Lager these beers are my staples. I don't get out often anymore, but these are staples at home. No doubt that this brewery really knows its stuff!",0.5637055064030818,5.0,0.8738

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Bottled April 12, 2010 (2007 vintage).  Beer is a cloudy pink with a smallish white head. Head dissipates quickly, no lace.  Smell contains raspberry, barnyard funk and grass. Good smell and typical Cantillon.  Taste is quite sour. Raspberry, funk, hay. A marked sweetness accompanies the sour. All good, though not as complex as some of the beers from this brewery.  Light bodied, highly carbonated. Sticky and puckering. The sugar makes it a bit hard to get through.  Overall, very nice. Certainly not my favourite beer from Cantillon, but a very good lambic.",0.6668882313690141,4.5,0.8731
Juicy,"Shared from a 375ml bottle. Smelled the bottle when uncapped and the initial aroma was ugly vegetal, cabbage-y funk. Strange. Then the pour. Really opened up. Hugely aromatic beer - melon first, then gooseberries, NZ sauvignon blanc, spicy cedar, tropical fruits, new world hops all over the place. Flavor was bright and citrusy, heavy on white wine barrels and hops - not bitter, just aromatic. Hard to tell where the hops end and wine barrels begin. Masterfully done. Loved this beer. Big and complex and beautiful. Way to go, Shaun.",0.6574235883873295,4.5,0.873

Society & Solitude #4,"The beer comes in an opaque gorgeously sunset golden orange.  The aroma jumps out of apricot, nectarine, mango, passionfruit, tangerine, dried tropical fruit, some dank quality.  The flavor follows with tropical fruit gum, dried mango, dried stone fruit, candied tangerine, a white bready malt in the middle, lingering fruit along with a soft herbaceous bitterness, along with a dank aftertaste.

Sang Noir,On tap at the Cascade brewpub: 2014 version at 9.8% ABV in July 2016.  Sour aroma with sour cherries and vague dark dried fruits. Nice complexity.  Lovely dark ruby body with a lasting off-white head that leaves a draping of sticky lacing on the snifter.  Moderate tartness. More cherry in the taste than the aroma.

Fort Point Pale Ale,"16oz can in a stemmed tulip glass.  A careful pour yields a hazy glass-beaded orange color with a 1f white cap. The head tapers to a lasting film and leaves some foam lacing.  Hop aromas spill into the air; citrus, orange, tropical pineapple. Slightly dank with some alcohol soaked wheat and malt.   Mango and pineapple with a peach finish. The flavor is hop driven, the dry biscuit malt takes a back seat.   The light crisp body is good, and the hop flavor and gentle hop bite are good. I'm not getting enough ""pale ale"" malt body behind those hops.   I like it and I'll seek out some more of this brew but, honestly, it's an all-hop pale ale...to me.",0.6534830916707494,4.0,0.872

Sang Noir,"Bottle: Pours a deep burgundy. Head has a lightly purple to red hue to the beige creamy froth, and provides a bunch of lacing.  Nose is sour with a vinegar and lemon aspect. Sour cherry comes secondarily, ahead of a light vanilla note. Bourbon isn’t really coming to me, though.  A light malt and tartness opens, but the sour (cherry to crab apple) leading, lightly vinegary notes come fast. These fade and a dark cherry gets a chance to be noticed. Warmth mellows the sourness and a semblance of cherry soda exists in the background. I’m thinking maybe a little vanilla from the barrel helps here, but the tartness still keeps a shroud over this flavor.  Wanted more complexity and some bourbon character. A decent sour, nonetheless.",0.6638888798974301,4.0,0.872

Taste comes off moderate to high sour scale, high acidity, and a little bit boozy. Sweet as well blended with the sour. Not quite as funky in the taste as in the aroma. Feel is quite interesting as the sweet/sour taste you'd expect a cloying syrupiness in the back of your throat but it finishes very clean. Gets high marks for that.  Overall this is quite the exceptional beer, but I think the high ABV and high acidity and sour lean it a tad too extreme and not subtle complex enough.",0.7513345796895683,4.75,0.8717
Flora - Blueberry,"Purchased at Hill Farmstead in 6/2014  A- Body is a translucent raspberry hue that pours with a light maroon 2-3 finger very foamy, fizzy head. The head quickly and disappointingly fades almost completely to a thin collar. When held up to the light bubbles can be seen steadily rising to the top.  S- tart blueberry, sweet blueberry, acidic sourness. The blueberry is very authentic but I'm not getting any of the wine barrel or original characteristics described in flora or florence.  T-Flavor is a little milder than the nose. Tart blueberries upfront with very mild white wine overtones, and a background of faint oak barrel, a very faint hint of beady yeast and funk. The finish has some mild acidic tartness to add...but it consistent with the initial flavors. The complexity really comes through as the beer warms. There is just the slightest hint of funk to it.  M- Very low carbonation, relatively flat. Body is medium weight and has a slightly acidic consistency and a slightly watery consistency.  O- Overall this is a very well done, complex beer. I have not had Florence but I am having trouble finding the base beer after the wine barrel aging and addition of blueberries. I really like this beer but before my rating the rating that this beer has is just about equal to a very famous belgian blueberry lambic.

Sure Bet,"Features honey and mango puree, and Citra and Mosaic hops...  Poured an orange-amber color, hazed to translucency, with a finger of creamy white head on top... Was braced for something super-sweet, but this is a fairly restrained beer in that regard - tropical fruits, like mango - come through on the nose and sip, but have a very green character to them - making me think not or sweet, ripe, mango, but rather, the green skin of an unripe fruit... The honey is subdued, too, and there is more of a bitter tang to the beer than I expected, with a little soft honey sweetness rounding off the edges... Medium body has a tautness to it, which I appreciate, but I thought this would be a sweeter, fuller-bodied beer... Had to adjust my expectations as I drank it... I'll have to see if my impression changes with the second half of the bomber, but for my tastes this was really nice - reminds me a bit of a more bitter version of a Southern Tier DIPA I had the past coupla days, Help! On The Way!, which also featured mango...",0.6621761504639704,4.25,0.8712

Scaled Up,"someone said it best ""like a mimosa""..... hell yes! but natural and with no fruit juices like BP has been doing, turning it all novelty n sh*t..... this is EXCEPTIONAL! if this is the future of beer i'm never gonna lose any weight. this stuff is incredible!! read the other reviews for flavors, tastes, etc..... but leave some of this for me, please..... this BLOWS the Plinys and Headys away!!!!!",0.5620453621649006,5.0,0.8706
Madagascar,"Have had multiple vintages over the years, and for its time it was revolutionary in how it captures the vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, marshmallow, and wood all together. Smell still can hang with the best of them in my opinion. Some years are closer to cloying than others, but all never do. Heavy feel with cool sweetness.",0.6249993672648532,4.75,0.8705
Nelson,"From a 22oz bottle that says best by March 17th. I keep hearing how this beer has gotten so much worse since the Green Flash buyout. I can't comment on that since I wasn't able to get it where I live until after that buyout, but I have to say, this is still a really solid IPA. Maybe Green Flash has gotten better at making it, or maybe their version was just a victim of hype. Whatever the case, even this much maligned version of Nelson is definitely worth trying.",0.4816921224491749,4.25,0.8705
Sip Of Sunshine,"On-tap @ American Beauty in New York, NY.  Deep gold and cloudy with a thick, creamy, white head. Tropical and stone fruit in the aroma from the hops with no malt detectable. Flavor is hops upon hops upon hops, bringing together those tropical and stone fruit flavors and throwing grapefruit into the mix, sacrificing balance for a hop-heavy profile. Strong bitterness in the finish. Medium-full body that's very dry, sticky, and resinous.  Probably a hop head's dream, but nothing that says ""world class"" to me. Nonetheless, pretty cool to get to try this in NYC. A few years ago, I didn't think I'd ever get my hands on a Lawson's product outside of Vermont.",0.6430807043999885,3.75,0.8705
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Vintage 2016 poured in proper glassware. Maybe not as balanced as mornin delight b1 or as complex as sr-71, but this is a top tier beer. Mapple dominates over the coffee and whiskey. Definitely worth the hype.",0.5972339460447869,5.0,0.8705
Very GGGreennn,"Pours super hazy, orange-gold in color with 1/4 inch head. Taste is big honeydew melon, bubblegum, orange creamsicle and pineapple. Heavy bodied, sweet, with moderate carbonation. Wow is there a burn at the back end of this beer. Super hop saturation. Very thick. A total sipper of an ipa. Gggreennn blew me away. This one is great, but is not as mind blowing an experience as that beer. Still exceptional.",0.6362838557785427,4.5,0.8705
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"Pours a jet black with a light tan foam that disappears quickly. Nose is beautiful. Notes of caramel, vanilla and maple along with a strong bourbon presence. Taste of nice amount of barrel, charred oak, maple syrup, caramel, vanilla, a shot of bourbon and toasted malt. Lighter on the body than expected but still manages to be somewhat creamy in texture. Jackie O's knows how to barrel aged a excellent beer.",0.6528347998905805,4.25,0.8705
Chocolate Rain,Typical big Bruery beer look. Little head that goes away fast. But at 19% what do you expect. Big chocolate smell and bourbon. Taste is fudge with some alcohol bite at the end. Feel is slightly thin. But that's how all these weekday stouts are so it's expected. Amazing overall beer from one of the top brueries to do the big stout.,0.6110847273140747,4.75,0.8704
Coconut B-Bomb,"L: pours pretty thick, black but not pitch black, and only a film of head.  S: oak, leather, coconut, chocolate, bourbon. Nice aroma but it isn't jumping out of the glass. T: much bigger coconut than the aroma, big coconut throughout. Bourbon soaked mounds bar. The bourbon barrel this very flavorful...oaky, leather and bourbon. The barrel and coconut work awesome together.  F: thick, smooth, sticky, coating, with low carbonation.  O: fantastic beer!",0.6080062173726639,4.75,0.8703
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Enjoyed a 2013 last night with my old man.   Everything about this beer just defined the word smooth, from the pour itself through to the finish. Nothing jumped out about any particular flavors, just tremendous balance throughout. The 3+ years of age (plus 12 year-old Elijah) have done this brew wonders, as the barrel has been tamed down to a wonderful subtleness. It shows itself just enough so you know you're drinking something barrel-aged, but that's all - something not often said about a big stout, such as this. In fact, considering the rather muted barrel and lighter, smoother viscosity, I could have probably drunk the entire bottle, which I normally can never do with any bomber. Curious how this tastes ""fresh,"" but with the $30 price point, that's likely to only happen with trade.  Cheers!",0.5929242203659032,4.75,0.8702
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"L: Classic turbid and hazy Trillium look with a generous inch high fluffy white head and moderate retention S: Clementines, lemons, and grapefruit on the nose with a soft dankness T: Very juicy and devoid of the typical onion punch often associated with El Dorado hopped brews (looking at you Other Half). Much more of a lime zest, grapefruit, and light mango flavor profile with a soft hop bitterness at the end F: Requisite Trillium soft and medium-bodied mouthfeel  O: This was fantastic - another phenomenal offering from Trillium showcasing a very tasty hop in El Dorado. This surpassed my expectations and was much less acerbic than I imagined prior to tasting it. Sweet, juicy, soft, and dank - all good things. Well played, Trillium.",0.6839000639851961,4.75,0.87
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Received from @SomethingClever – Thanks Dave! Undated bottle (Other than 2016) stored at 42 degrees. Served at 50 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Aroma – coffee – no bourbon, no barrel. It does fade as the brew warms in my glass. Head small (Maximum 1.5 cm, aggressive pour), tan, medium density and average retention, diminishing to a four mm ring of tiny to small bubbles and a thin partial layer. Lacing – none. Body – dark brown/black, opaque. Flavor – wow! Coffee with stout added. Initially a little bourbon comes through, but when it warms on my tongue, the barrel and the alcohol become very noticeable. There is also a little of the char from the barrel present which contributes heavily to the aftertaste. No hops, no diacetyl.  Palate – medium, creamy, lively carbonation.  Interesting beer – quite unlike any prior coffee BBA stout I’ve ever had. This has more depth of taste than most, once you get past that initial blast of coffee. This grows on me with each swallow.  Appearance – 4, Aroma 3.75, Flavor 4.5, Palate 4, Overall 4.25.",0.6586058142891797,4.25,0.87
Flora - Blueberry,"Bottled Oct 12, 2018.  A: Pours a clear garnet with a cap of bright white head with largish bubbles. Recedes quickly to a razor thin ring and then to nothing. Minimal retention and no lacing.  S: Sharp, earthy blueberry, moderate grainy wheat and pretty hefty horse blanket, dry spiced oak.   T: Watery, lightly acidic blueberry, mild earthy funk, barnyard, and grainy wheat. A lingering medium-light tartness imparts a nice refreshing aspect.   M: Light bodied, crisp, with medium-high spritzy carbonation.   O: Smells exceptional, but the taste is a bit watery with muted brett flavor. This would be a very good warm weather beer.",0.719613844162954,4.25,0.8697
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"What can I say? Bar none the best beer I've ever had and absolutely worth the hype. 2014 gold wax poured into an open mouth wine glass.   Smell- holy molasses batman.   Taste- starts off with coffee dominance and some chocolate and then the molasses hits you, truly what makes this beer worth the chase  Mouthfeel- not sure how toppling Goliath does it, but both this and assassin are by far the best mouthfeel in a beer I've had. Coats your mouth like a smoothie, making this beer truly elite.   Overall- perfect. For sure worth a 5/5 rating.",0.5656800310886354,5.0,0.8696
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"Poured on draft at the brewery.  Aromas of chocolate fudge, brownies, chocolate chip cookies, and mild coffee.  The flavor is taken straight from Willy Wonka's secret stash. I have never had anything this chocolatey before, and I've eaten hot fudge out of the container. There's some chocolate graham crackers and coffee on the back end, but it's completely overwhelmed by the achocalypse. I feel violated.  The feel is a bit much. It's thick and syrupy with absolutely no carbonation whatsoever.  Overall, this is a great milk stout but perhaps a bit unbalanced and gimmicky for my liking. It's literally chocolate syrup with alcohol content. Still, can't deny the ridiculous amount of flavor coming from the glass.",0.6041283771431879,4.25,0.8695
Scaled Up,Poured from 64 oz growler. This may be the haziest beer I've ever seen. It looks like a cloud saturated with peach juice ready to rain. Only problem is zero head retention. Wide array of citrus peel in the smell. A mix of orange and grapefruit juice in the smell as well. Grapefruit forward with a bit of dank pine. Feel is fresh squeezed juice for days. Great beer.,0.6236018614643167,4.75,0.8689

Aaron,"500ml bottle poured into a matching HF large wine glass appears muddy brown with a khaki head that fades leaving spotty lace.  Aroma has a mealy sort of aspect that smells like dirt/earthworms after it rains. There are minerals, oak, caramel and booze also present.  Taste has a striking amount of barrel flavor that is so woody, it comes across like incense/cedar. Caramel, maple, prunes, vanilla and boozy bourbon are all accounted for.

Haze,Got some cans of this from my buddy out in Boston.   Pours almost a murky yellow orange with a nice head. Get notes of orange on the nose.

Swish,"On tap at the King's Head in Portland (Maine) today.  The beer pours a very hazy golden amber color with pretty good head retention and light lacing. On the nose, the aroma profile is pretty spectacular, as I get considerable tropical fruit, citrus and pine. This beer smells great. Given the aroma profile, it was hard not to be a bit disappointed in what I tasted. This is still a tasty DIPA, but there just wasn't as much flavor as I was expecting, and there was some noticeable heat/bite from the alcohol in this beer. Otherwise, the flavor profile replicates the nose, with a long, fairly dry, lightly bitter finish. The alcohol isn't a huge presence on the finish, but even so, especially considering the abv., I was a bit disappointed with this beer's drinkability (the noticeable alcohol clearly detracted from the beer's drinkability).  I sort of wonder if this beer suffers a bit from the hype. it's a solid DIPA for sure, but considering the excitement and near hysteria about this beer's release (upcoming in cans), I was expecting something a bit more mind blowing. Still a very nice DIPA, but IMHO, this beer can't hold a candle to the substance IPA (which is still the best beer I've had from the folks at BB).",0.6553432212465875,4.0,0.8688
Mastermind,"This was poured into a snifter. The appearance was a hazy burnt grapefruit yellow to orange color. The head dissipated immediately leaving some messy sticky lacing clinging to the glass. The smell started off with juicy grapefruit leaning towards the pulp side. Bitterness comes from the pine and has a slight underscore of citrus rind to balance. The taste reels in the sweet grapefruit and brings about a nice settling clean bitter sticky pine. The aftertaste is quick, sharp and light grapefruit with a crisp finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a clean crisp sticky grapefruit and slightly resinous feel coating my tongue. Overall, this was an extremely well done DIPA that I would love to have again.",0.7034105060203804,4.75,0.8687
Haze,"Really hazy peach color with off-white head. Aroma has really juicy hops with nice tropical flavors. Taste is even more intense.

Mastermind,"Poured into a 13 oz tulip, canned on 8/21/14. Pours a cloudy yellow, with a one inch head, that leaves behind plenty of lace.   Smell is blueberry, lemon, grapefruit, apricot, and pine.   Taste is very aggressive almost like fruit loops, pine, lemon, and grapefruit, but the fruit loops thing ruins this beer for me.   Body is almost medium, plenty of life, a little dry, and easy enough drinking.  Overall this a pretty unusual DIPA, not bad. Second Fiddle blew me away and this is o.k.",0.6363343843352304,4.25,0.8687

Madagascar,"9oz draft pour into a rocks glass shows an opaque deep dark brown, almost black body and floats a 1/2in brown head leaving sporadic lacing. Aromas include oak, chocolate, roasty, bourbon, and a slight vanilla.  Flavors match with bourbon being the most present bringing out more vanilla, but the roasted coffee flavor at the end is a downer.  Mouthfeel is full and leaning heavy with a silky sweetness left on the tongue, although the sudden roast coffee bean aftertaste is not my favorite reminder if this imperial stout.

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"A: The pour is viscous and black with just a bit of tan foam around the edge of the glass.  S: A definite oak and bourbon presence to the nose without the intense sweetness Dark Lord usually has. Certainly some sweet chocolate and vanilla with a bit of dark fruits.  T: The oak aging gives this one a bit of a tannic character and some bitterness that the original does not exhibit. The bourbon, vanilla, and oak flavors are quite strong but still allow the chocolate, roast, licorice, and dark fruits to show.  M: The body is thick and chewy with a low, smooth carbonation.  D: I like this one much better than Dark Lord. The oak aging here has helped to balance the beer out and mitigate the overwhelming sweetness.",0.680066276034064,4.0,0.8678
Chocolate Rain,"Large shared 2013 bottle that went quickly!  Sweet aroma with some alcohol esters precedes an even boozier and markedly sweet flavor. Near cloying sweet level.

Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Having had a handful of Eclipse stouts, I can say that this is a good one. Aged in whiskey barrels and brewed with honey, it had a thick body and rich aromas off the pour - chocolates, vanilla and coffee, something vaguely tannic... The feel is smooth and dense, with honey's sweetness melding into a caramel/molasses complex that builds on the warm rich roasted malts. Sweet and decadent, augmented nicely with booziness. The only detractor, if you didn't know, is the price-point - these bombers run about $32 around here. Worth it, but tough to make repeat buys.",0.7005813996390649,4.5,0.8674

Nose is citrus - orange, lemon, lime, some tropical notes, and background piney resin  Taste is initially a minor sweet note, and then a wave of citrus - grapefruit, lemon, lime, and a hoppy finish.  Mouthful is medium to light with an initial bite, reminiscent of a sour, that mellows to a creamy character. The carbonation is average to high. The finish is dry.

Sang Noir,"A-Pours very dark. Light really struggles to make its way through. Medium sized, bubbly, tan head. Webby lacing.  S-A substantial aroma of sour cherries. Hints of chocolate. Lots of oak. More wine barrel than bourbon barrel but both are noticeable. The cherries dominate.  T-The base blend of red ales in more prominent that I would have expected or wanted. It obviously funky and sour and such but it's finish is a bit too generic. Cherries are both sweet and sour. Not picking up much bourbon barrel, rather far more vinous character. Lacks complexity surprisingly. Just a bunch of cherries and sweetness.  M-Plenty of body. It's creamy but the bubbles are fairly aggressive. Dry, slightly tannic. A bit boozy.

Green,"Thanks to DustinGalvin for this 16 oz. can. The can is green, too. I would love to see a green batch of wort. Canned date 4/26/17. Practically dusty.   I was hoping the beer would follow suit but alas, no shamrock IPA for me. Looks like pureed banana, peel & all. Smells tropical without any specifics, like standing in the middle of a Dole plan. Dead middle. Without leaning towards any specific fruit assembly line.   Green leans towards the fruit/vegetable category than IPA. Lots of fruit: I get the tangerine & pineapple, along with a slurry of other stuff, much of it pulpy. Drinks more like a smoothie than a beer. Bitterness is moderate mid-palate, plus fresh-mown right field grass & a parting shot of mango. Thick, & the high point is the drink ability; this should come in slop buckets.   Tastes like it should have an umbrella in & be served on the beaches of Varadero. A very good beer, but, really?",0.6376341273150952,4.0,0.867

Instead (and I've really had to focus on this), I taste a very subtle cantaloupe. Seriously.  I'd really like to get pint out of a cask...hint, hint.

Beatification,"Thanks to mlaroche for trading this to me, been wanting to try this one for awhile.  Bottled 01/10/12 6% ABV  Pours a golden yellow color with a thin head that quickly disappears, no lacing on the glass.  Wow, I can tell this is going to be a sour kick to the private parts just based on aroma alone, huge lactic citrus notes with a slight touch of funk to change up the scent.  Taste is as anticipated and even strong, really sets my tongue off with a huge sour bite on the sides, instantly makes my mouth water afterward, a bit too strong though with the sour since it covers up most of the complexity, takes several sips before the mouth can adapt and make out the subtle woody character, carbonation is appropriately high and explosive even though it looks flat in the glass.

All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"L - can art is on point. Similar style as In Perpetuity. Gee, I wonder if the two beers are related? Pours the richest, darkest, silky-looking reddish black. Looks pretty thin. Gorgeous mocha brown head, but it dissipates quickly.   S - pure milk chocolate. I've never smelled this much chocolate in a beer before. Slightest bit of bitter roast/dark chocolate on the finish. Brown sugar and vanilla.   T - holy crap this is downright decadent. German chocolate cake, fudge brownies. Drinks like Single Shot, punches like Double Shot. More raw cocoa on the tongue than the nose. Hints of black iced coffee combine with a soothing licorice hop bitterness on the finish making this ultimately refreshing which is strange, considering this is a stout after all! I can't think of a better brew on a cool Fall morning, sitting out on the porch watching the leaves turn as the fresh, crisp air tickles the goosebumps on your skin.   F - like I said before, similar to Single Shot. Light and drinkable without sacrificing flavor. Velvety.   O - just can't get over the chocolate! Packs a lot of flavor into an otherwise tame package. I do not think it's better than SS or DS, but it's a welcome addition to the stout lineup!",0.6467636696945535,4.5,0.866

Smells like citrus, hay, barn, phenols. Tastes pretty great, sour citrus with abut of plastic at the end but damn was this easy to knock back! Overall I lived it and wish I had more.

As well as bourbon and some chocolate  T: Dark fruits, vanilla accompanied by a coffee/dark chocolate texture. The bourbon & booze content is there, but I wouldn’t say it’s overwhelming.   M: Soft, easygoing, comfortable, and particularly smooth are the adjectives I’ll use to describe what most 19% beers are not.

Black Tuesday,"Finally getting to try this long-time want. Been sitting in the ""cellar"" for a few months and decided it's the 4th of July weekend and no reason to keep cellaring a beer I have not had. Thanks to beerinNV for the chance to try this!  Pouring out of the bottle not nearly as black as I expected. Nearly zero head. Big alcohol legs. Almost more of a deep chestnut brown that black.  Smells like caramel and bourbon most predominantly. Then appealing burnt sugars. Finally a slight alcohol burn in the nostrils.   Taste follows the nose for the most part. Big, nearly diabetic sweetness -- and I don't mean that negatively. It really works with the beer. Bourbon and barrel notes. Also caramelized malts. Slight alcohol sting on the finish.  As would be expected, low carb but actually a almost surprisingly light mouth feel. It does finish sticky and sweet.  No doubt this beer is an accomplishment. The booze is extremely well integrated. It's there for sure but less hot than beers that are 5 or 6 percent less booze. An experience worth having.",0.5956275644017915,4.5,0.8638
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,Pours a little thin but has the most intense fizzy head. Nice and creamy half finger layer on top.  Smell is a major let down. Normally jackie o's wreaks of bourbon in the most inviting way. With this I smell fain cinnamon meddled with pool chlorine. Very little bourbon. This alone is going to drag it's rating into the trenches on this review but I'm still hopeful it'll be a tongue twister.  Big red gum from start to finish. Pepper heat invites itself mid way through until the finish in just the right amount. There's vanilla and sugar but so little bourbon - how uncharacteristic of jackie o's!? The heat intensifies as it warm - points for that as I've never had a beer too spicy. Slightly more bitterness as it warms also. Vanilla is also building as it warms.  The feel is mostly dry with a grittiness to it. Not thin but definitely not thick.  Overall - I like it more than regular oro negro (which I'm not a fan of). It has more heat than its little brother.  Value - for a $13 - 375ml beer this is a bit overrated. Bomb! Does it better at the same price point without the barrel treatment and I'd take it over this. I've yet to come across bb bomb! But assuming the same price range I can't imagine it not being better $4$ than this.,0.6221196623861116,4.0,0.8638
Oude Geuze Vintage,2002 vintage bottle drank in 2008: Poured a slightly hazy orangey color lambic with a medium white bubbly head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of green apple with some acid and sour notes and some mild barnyard notes. Taste is less acidic then the aroma was suggesting with some sour notes and a barnyard feel which is quite interesting. There was some distinctive green apple notes which are similar to the Girardin gueuze. Full body with some good carbonation but slightly lower then I was expecting.

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"On tap at Lake Bryant Bowl the other day. Was absolutely overjoyed to see this on tap in the twin cities.  The beer pours the expected blackish brown color with attractive, mocha colored lacing and good head retention. The beer certainly looks attractive enough. On the nose I pick up considerable coffee, chocolate light vanilla, a bit of tobacco and light bourbon. While attractive, I guess I was expecting a bit more of everything. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, though the beer isn't as rich tasting as I was expecting. Mouthfeel is medium bodied to full, and the beer is fairly soft on the palate. Alcohol is fairly well integrated into the flavor profile.  I shared my glass with a friend over the course of an hour, and each time I came back to it, my reaction was the same. This is a nice enough beer, but it's just not wowing me, and I really don't feel the need to order more than the one small glass I ordered.",0.6758526052193469,4.0,0.8628

Society & Solitude #4,"A 750 ml growler poured into a tulip glass about two weeks after the growler was filled. Beer pours a hazy orange color, nothing visible through it, with a finger of soft frothy off white head. Head dissipates after a few minutes, leaving heavy lacing on the edge of the glass, to a collar of frothy bubbles. Really nice lacing.  Nose orange fruit and peel, mango, pineapple, pine, dank herbal and grassy hops, and light caramel sweetness.   Taking a sip, citrus peel bitterness, orange and grapefruit, and sweeter hops, orange, mango and pineapple. Mid tongue, more dank pine and herbal flavors dominate with continuing light sweet hops and a bit of caramel malt to help balance the bitterness.

Sang Noir,Review from notes a year ago. 750ml bottle poured into a snifter. The brew appears brown in color with a tan finger of head. The lacing is creamy with a full wall painted on the glass. Some lighter brown almost yellowish clarity is seen around the edges.  The brew smells fruity. Somewhat funky and earthy with plenty of cherry. So much earth that it almost covers up the minor medicinal cherry alcohol note that emerges more as it warms.  The flavor includes a medicinal sort of tart cherry mixed with earth. The barrel aging brings out a minor amount of vanilla that pairs very well with the cherry fruit character. Some raw and woody aftertaste is noticed when big sips are taken.  This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is somewhat effervescent yet meets everything expected of a fruited sour. I really enjoy tasting the barrel character in sours blended with the fruit addition. I would drink this again.,0.6883298101297096,4.25,0.8613

Even with that amount, a legit +9 on the 1-10 scale, some oak still comes in.  Taste hits that 8 note on the scale, massive cherry drop only to be rivaled by LPK from Cantillon probably.

Black Tuesday,"Had the 2014 edition on tap at The Bruery. Although the 2016 is deceptively smooth in its own right, this well-aged variety is a sleuthy son of a gun. Dark as night but not the least bit bitter. You dont get the alcohol upfront or in the back end. Rather, you get that charming belly warming that you might get from a peated scotch. No wonder this thing is so popular. At around 20% on any given year, this beer tastes much more like something in the 12 - 14% range",0.6039727291622924,4.75,0.8595

This beer hits all of the check marks: a beautiful golden copper color, tropical and citrusy hop aromas, the same flavors on the taste, with that special ""dankness"" that only the truly world-class IPA's/DIPA's have, the ever-so-slight creamy mouthfeel from a beer that allows the malt base to have that moment.

Sang Noir,"750ml bottle. Caged and corked bottle. 2014 Project Vintage. Dark brown colored body, with a cherry red hut when black lit. Slight tan fizzy head disappears quickly. No lacing. Aroma of dark cherry fruit, along with oak barrel, with some bourbon barrel and a vinous wine barrel. The main aroma character is woody and dark cherry fruit. Taste is sour, with a complex mix of what was in the aroma, plus a dark malt that almost goes to chocolate. Full of dark cherry, dark wine (port), and oak bourbon barrel. The end is rather dry, with the rich malt trailing off.  Medium plus mouth feel, and not quite a tooth scraper (because the sour is tempered by the malt). Good carbonation, with bubbles rising to feed a very thin ring. The presentation color on this is striking and not often encountered, with the dark cherry combining with the dark brown. Smell and flavors are layered and many, but well blended in the end. In many ways this drinks like a dark red wine, but more sour. The higher ABV% is well hidden.",0.6615448409754041,4.5,0.8591
Fort Point Pale Ale,"The beer is a hazy, bright, yellow-gold coloring that is almost opaque, with a frothy, foamy, bright white head that sits low profile and doesn't appear to be going anywhere. Aromas of citrus initially, with a grassy undertone that anchors the nose a bit. Flavors are a citrus blast on the forward tongue, followed by a subtle biscuit backbone that balances well. Lemon and tangerine dance across the palate with every sip, and there is a grassy and peppery blend to keep the sweetness in check. Smooth, mid-bodied, with light, almost effervescence into the aftertaste of citrus sweetness. Slick, clean, slightly dry finish that leaves some citrusy linger behind. Easy drinker but just okay for me. Review may have been influenced by drinking a Cutting Tiles DIPA prior to this.",0.7130877731599559,3.75,0.8591

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Drank at the Dark Lord Release Party 2006. The barmaid said it was 16% abv.   Appearance- Given to me an oily, iscous, black. No highlights in this soul stealing, liver pickling bad boy. Head was a lovely coffee like beige with great retention.   Smell- Like French Roast coffee, bakers bitter chocolate, with hints of heavy whipping cream and cascade hops.   Taste- Very dense and thick in the coffee department. But this taste does not let you forget that it was aged in a barrel. The wood sugars certainly give your balls a hows your father. Coffee and oak mixed with some black licorice and a well balanced American hop and malt balance.   Mouthfeel- Very oily, sludgy and thick. This is a dense beer with a lot of palate coating ability. All the dark flavors really stick to the palate the most, all parts of the tongue. Something to nibble on chocolate with.",0.6434194447507208,4.0,0.859

As you swirl the glass, you can see legs and impact viscosity has. Maybe even stained the glass! Aromas of robust chocolate, vanilla,... roast and malty with big barrel presence. Never had such complexity and array of flavors from a non-adjunct barrel aged beer. Didn't know it was possible. Thick mouthfeel. Perfect sipper.   I think this beer has ruined beer for me.

Bottle date 2015 on this one, need a fresh bottle to see what all this time did to it. A lot of bread, grapes, grass, wine and hop bitterness in both nose and taste. The wine barrels seemingly diminish whatever profound tartness wants to come out and punch you in the jaw. I'll drink this again and again and again.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"OK, time to drown this puppy. Picked up at the release (where there were numerous Minnesota beer geeks in attendance) & this is the lone & single bottle resting in the fridge. Now resting in my glass. Well, half in my glass, half in my wife's glass. 12 oz. bottle with silver wax.   The pour is dark night, carbonation close to the non-existent side. The nose - wow. Like the best pancake house in the world, with grade A maple syrup made in house & a cold press coffee place beside the kitchen. Then the waitress sets a glass of bourbon next to the syrup. Seriously. Magnificent.   Kentucky Brunch is one of those beers that can't possibly live up to the hype, right? Wrong. More maple syrup taste than any beer I've ever come into contact with - & I like small-batch, artisanal maple syrup almost as much as I like beer. And I swear I can taste the waffles. Big bourbon wallop is cut by just the right amount of coffee; not enough to tip this into an annoying coffee bomb, but enough to get a taste. Mild chocolate & vanilla & drying wood in the middle. The end is pure bliss. Thick, thick, thicker, but ridiculously drinkable. I'm thinking of stealing my wife's half & making a run for it. I'm faster than she is. She'd never catch me before I finished it.   Holy bloody hell. I wish I'd have brought 36 mules to the release, because I would have drunk every single bottle in a span of about 20 days. This is a beautiful beer, & I hope it turns into an annual release. No, screw that, a weekly release. This beer is...perfect. My fourth perfect score in 1500 reviews. Wow.

Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Bought this one a bit ago in St. Louis. Wine and cheese place! The last non LA sour I opened in the district. Date: 4/2010 on label. Served in FFF Teku glass.   A - A beautiful ruby red color. Very slight carbonation that fizzes Champagne style and settles.  S - Super funky up front. Slight stinky cheese/foot in the middle and lots of funky, sour cherries on the back end.  T - A huge blast to the tongue of tart, tart cherries. It finishes with plenty of funk, fruit, and especially acidity. One of the most tart krieks I've ever had.  M - This beer is incredibly bright, airy, and light. Light to medium mouthfeel with slight residual sweetness.  O - Not a bad beer at all. It's up there with Cantillon LP Kriek and Cable Car Kriek. It's way more tart than the other two, if that's your thing. But it still feels more balanced than it probably is.

There is some light candied berry sweetness up front followed by citrus and citrus zest. Some chocolate covered oranges, which I'm not crazy about. As with most Trillium IPAs, it has a soft mouthfeel. There is also that chalkiness that I also have found in Congress St, which I personally enjoy.

Peche 'n Brett,"Tulip glass.  A: Pours golden with a nice covering of snow white head which recedes quickly to a ring. Very good retention for what head there is, and some nice chaotic streaks of lacing.  S: Fresh cut, sweet, delicious peaches and an undercurrent of spice, a little malt, and very mild citrus hops, and a little oak as it warms.  T: Peaches and pale-ish malt, some fruity esters and a little brett, and more juicy citrus fruit on the medium length finish. Mild acidity gives this a little brightness. A little oak character comes through as it warms to near room temperature.  M: Medium carbonation with noticeable bite which softens with some time in the glass. Creamy texture and no alcohol noticeable at 10 (!) percent.  O: Exceedingly--nay, dangerously--drinkable. A very well executed farmhouse ale. The fruit is prominent but not overwhelming. I guess if I had any complaints, it would be that I don't get a lot of oak character, and the brett is pretty minimal.",0.6964424978566126,4.25,0.8557

Sticky, spicy, herbal, cannabic aromas are complemented and maybe even toned down a touch by a cedar forest, sticky juicy peach, and pineapple upside-down cake.  Herbal, spicy young pine and copious amounts of sweet orange and young, fresh nectarine--almost white peach--are lightly backed by earthy flavors like peanut brittle or caramel corn, biscuit.

A: Pours a hazy dark gold, with a big fluffy white head with great retention. Moderate visible carbonation. 4.5/5  S: Musty funk from the Brettanomyces, saison yeastiness, cracker malts, and dry tannins from the oak. I get minimal to no peaches on the nose, which is a bit disappointing. 15/20  T: Tart peaches under a big Brett funkiness, musty barnyard saison yeast and bready malts. Light oak tannins. Dry and lightly tart in the finish. The peach flavors do increase as the beer warms during the drink. 37/45  M: Average weight to body, good carbonation sensation, and the alcohol is well-hidden. 7/10  O: This was pretty tasty, but I was a little disappointed. I expected more peach flavor and tartness, and the Brett funk and wild farmhouse character seemed to predominate.

Peche 'n Brett,"An orchard in a glass. Lovely, fragrant nose that is pure, high summer peaches. The color is a golden amber, not unlike a Bellini. The taste is very fruit forward -- one of the biggest peach-flavored beers I've had this side of Chez Monus. You can almost feel the peach juice dribbling down your chin. Absolutely lovely. The sweet peach is firmed up by a bit of Brett funkiness and the barrel oak. This is as close to summer as you are going to get after a long, cold winter. Great beer, but I think I still might prefer the Seizoen Bretta a bit more. The subtleties of the saison are drowned out a bit by the intense peachiness. Still, a great beer.",0.6402316626212257,4.5,0.8548
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"On tap at DLD, 2008.  Opaque, black. In the light of day with the sun shining brightly, had just a bit of brown at the edges. Thick & viscous, lots of leg and no lacing. No head, just a few stray bubbles at the edge, dark brown in color.  Scent that first struck me was bourbon, followed by molasses. This was a very sweet smelling beer. Roast character was not really coming through at all. The dark fruit character present in regular DL also seemed toned down, but it was present.  Taste was more sweet than bitter, and was similar to the aroma. Bourbon, dark chocolate, hint of coffee and molasses. Fruit character minimized at this time. Very mild herbal bittering at the finish.  Mouthfeel was fantastic, but again, to me, not quite as good as the bottled version. Thick, smooth body. Minimal carbonation. Quite sweet. Alcohol starts to warm you up quickly.  An exceptional stout, but I prefer the regular. I think the oak aging covers up some of the complexity that I enjoyed in the regular version. Also, for some reason, the mouthfeel was not quite as impressive as in the bottled version, still very good, just not exceptional.

It is not my favorite flavor profile, but I have never had an IPA better than Swish.",0.6928728698497055,5.0,0.8541
Sang Noir,"For the price, definitely not worth it, way to 1 dimensional almost boonesfarmish. Hopefully, I spent $25 on a lesser bottle, otherwise I do think this should be $5-$8 a bomber.

Black Tuesday,"Appearance is cola brown, quite a bit lighter than I expected. Thin head, no lacing, some clarity. Nose is bourbon, fudge, char, and oak. Tons of sugar on the nose. Taste is super sweet with chocolate and vanilla, bourbon. Very hot towards the end, cloyingly sweet. Mouthfeel is hot with mellow carbonation.

Black Tuesday,"Picked this up from a great trade with Mike! (2012 vintage) An aggressive pour yielded no head or lacing with a rather flat looking pitch black body. The nose was huge and amazing. Tons of bourbon, oak, and roasty chocolate along with hints of vanilla, booze, espresso, and a touch of black licorice and soy sauce. The taste follows suit with huge notes of dark chocolate, bourbon, oak, and vanilla along with hints of booze soaked black cherries, espresso, molasses, port wine, and leather. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy and boozey and hot. There really was very little tangible carbonation. Overall, I've had this at tastings several times, but this was my first actual bottle of it. And although it's bold and full of flavor, it's so hot and boozey that it really detracts from the experience of drinking such a big beer. I drank this over the period of several hours and the booze was just relentless the entire time. I think I'll keep my other two bottles in the cellar for a while and see what happens...",0.6269731112142913,4.0,0.8534

Oude Geuze Vintage,"375ml bottle from 2010 vintage drank in Nov 2015. Drank at room temperature and poured into a 3F stemmed glass. Hard to imagine an improvement on the regular Oude Geuze from 3F, but this one delivers. Everything is more subtle and complex than the regular and there is a much deeper golden color. I'm really glad I was able to pick this one up from 3F. Could easily drink only this beer for the rest of my life.",0.6132217646071065,4.75,0.8534
Beatification,"B007.  A: A straw color. What head was there dissipated quickly. S: Funky, some lemon zest and tartness. Smells similar to Cuvée d' Industrial. T: same as the nose, some musty cellar, lemon zest, a nice tartness that isn't too sour. Everything you want. M: This is where it lacks a little. If it had a little more carb, I think it'd balance out better. O: This was a treat. This is why I love RR and Allagash, just a solid brew",0.6459897984470695,4.5,0.8531

Swish,Fresh can (new black one) poured into a snifter. The aromas reminded me a fruit smoothie with hops added. It pours cloudy orange and looks like mango/orange juice. The taste follows suit with a bunch of tropical fruit and citrus flavors. This is extremely drinkable with medium carbonation and a somewhat dry finish. Well done Bissell Brothers!

Blanc De Blancs,"=2018 release (batch 2).  A: Pours a pale orangish with no head or lacing. Decently hazy.   S: Moderate oak, sweet white wine, light barrel char, vanilla and cardamom, light earth and barnyard. Balanced toward the oak.  T: Leans more towards the white wine and green gooseberries than the nose, with light dry oak barrel and a moderate sourness through a long finish which is cut partially by a dose of sweetness. The palate comes off as a sort of sweet and sour thing.  M: Soft medium-light body with medium-high carbonation.   O: Really tasty stuff. The sourness is just a touch too high/sharp for my taste, and the sweetness is a bit high, but otherwise great flavors and balance between base and oak.",0.6991687704458539,4.5,0.8525

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Drinking it straight from the fridge (meaning too cold) and I notice the smell is bourbon and chocolate. It pours thick and syrupy. Lacing sticks around after the pour. As it warms, the chocolate bitterness builds and strengthens. There's a lot going on flavor wise. There's some sweetness but less than a BCS. It drinks very very smooth and although I taste the alcohol a bit, it's not overbearing at all. I'm glad I finally scored some this year and will try to get it always.",0.6090880345773042,4.5,0.8519

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Solid BB stout from a brewery that's pretty well known for them. I'll skip most of the usual review points that you can see already written and focus a little on the taste as I believe this is where it will make or break most folks. The initial taste is big fudge with a hint of vanilla following up. The cinnamon is underplayed and almost an afterthought, which I appreciate. The most interesting point is the after kick of heat from the habaneros - plain and simple, if you don't like heat in your beer then you probably won't appreciate this the way it is intended. Personally, I loved the heat kick. The taste was fine before that, but the heat gave it something extra that helped the flavor profile round together for me.",0.6189393466852874,4.5,0.8516
Sure Bet,looks amazing.. one of the most hazy beer I have seen  Smell was strong with this one..soon as I cracked the bottle I could smell it!  Taste was what shocked me most.. much les sweet and malty than the other pipework's IPAs I have had. more dry.. much more dry... I tend to like mine sweeter than most.. dry or not this think is DANK  Overall... not what I was expecting from pipe works this drinks more like a TG brew.,0.6161763403761762,4.5,0.8516

Black Tuesday,"Apperance: Pours out a sludgy dark brown. Just a wisp of dark brown head forms, which has basically no head retention or lacing. To be expected. Some carbonation is apparent on the edges of the glass.  Smell: Initial smell is of booze and intense sweetness. Some barrel is in there too. Not getting much else.  Taste: Intense milk chocolate sweetness up front, very cloying. A bit of barrel shows. Rest of the back end is mostly pure rubbing alcohol. Finish is cloying and messy.  Mouthfeel/Overall: Very thick on the palate initially with appropriate carbonation. Again, finish is super hot and messy which retracts. Overall, I did not like this beer and won't seek it out. All hype. Super boozy and sweet with no balance.",0.6715569285209405,2.5,0.8515
Nelson,Pours out a cloudy straw color. The head is off-white with moderate retention. Lacing is moderate as well.  The nose full of ripe pineapple and sweet orange. It has a mild orange zest bitterness to it for some balance. Reminds me of a fruit juice blend. The aroma is very strong on is one. Very good.  Very juicy. Tons of tropical fruit with a mild piney bitterness. Its also has a slight earthy quality to it. Its very well balance and tasty. The 7% abv is undetectable.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth. Carbonation is light. It feels wet and goes down nicely. No,0.7149502032628692,4.25,0.8514
Nectarine Premiere,"A: Pours a light straw color, soda-like fizz, with almost no head.   S: A big, earthy/horseblanket brett, pie-like sugary lemon, nectarine, peach, and a little lactic tartness. The brett is fairly dominant.   T: Nice mix of white wine, nectarine, peach, a bit of lemon, moderate earthy funk (toned down a bit from the nose), with medium-light tartness. The wine is prominent and adds a sweet roundness which cuts the tart and adds a really nice dimension. Shortish finish.  M: Light bodied, effervescent, with medium-high carbonation.  O: Really exceptional and refreshing. Nice blend of brett, citrus fruit, and wine, with light tartness which doesn’t limit drinkability. The taste is better balanced than the brett-dominant (but still appealing) nose.",0.7070793368758227,4.75,0.8513
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"375ml bottle in trade for...whatever it was I'd do it 10x again.  Black, opaque elixir poured into Lawson's snifter. Tan rim, scant lacing, legs on all sides.  Cinnamon, peppers, spice, bourbon, caramel, chocolate, vanilla, nutty-oak wisps. A really fantastic amalgam of aromas.  Bam! This is one complex brew and the taste brings forth from the aroma in spades. The cinnamon and vanilla offer a quick note, followed by a huge chocolate, fudge and habanero kick. The combo lingers on the backend with a nice peppery burn.  Full body, nicely carbonated, smooth pepper burn.  This one crushes the recent Huna releases (save '14) and ascends to the heights of the big boys.",0.6429089226743148,4.75,0.8513
Black Tuesday,"Standard 750mL Bruery bottle, poured into a snifter glass. 2013 bottle.  A: Black. Very little head or apparent carbonation. Almost no lacing. Flows oily.  S: Some roasty-ness, bitter fruits and booze. Sweet too.  T: Similar to the smell. Big boozy beer with lots of biter fruits. Not as much coffee/caramel/bourbon as expecting, but its not lacking. Very excellent. Doesnt taste like 19% either, thats not to say you cant taste the alcohol but it works well, it tastes strong, it works well but doesnt taste like im drinking 19%.  M: Oily and coating. A great thick feel, it coats the mouth.  O: I have had this beer sitting in a beverage cooler for about 5 months, anticipating opening it. I finally opened it, it wasnt what I expected (I was expecting more bourbon), but it was amazing in what it was.",0.6238177819923146,4.5,0.8511
Space Trace,"Goddamn, thanks for the pour Darren!  This one pours dark black, with no head or lacing.  This smells so strongly of sweet toasted coconut, high quality dark chocolate fudge, bourbon, and vanilla.  I get a lot of vanilla from the barrel here, it's so creamy, like cake frosting on this decadent German chocolate cake. There is just a ton of coconut here, none of that sun-tan lotion garbage- authentic, toasted coconut, slightly sweet, with a really nice deep dark fudgy character. This really does approximate German chocolate cake quite well. I've had the base beer before, and the barrel-aging just brings this beer all the way to completion.  This is thick, creamy, and velvety, with still a high level of drinkability despite that.  I almost don't want to like Bottle Logic, but I kind of have to. They make some absolutely baller pastry stouts.",0.6303503755021337,4.75,0.851

Mastermind,"One week old can poured into a wide jar glass. Remarkable light in color - an extremely hazy golden haze.   Very pineapple on the nose - almost a bit like the aroma you get from snapping the stem off of a fruit before skinning and chopping. Some more citrus and rind characters pop out as it warms.   Very fruity - melon, orange juice, and a slightly underripe pineapple. Semi-dry - not a bitter finish at all.   Good beer - really juicy and a very good example of a ne ipa that still has a bit of a linger to offset sweetness. But something nuanced is lacking - it could use a bit more yeast dryness.",0.6931978238103849,4.0,0.8509
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Bottled 6/2/17; drank 6/23/17 @ the Yarchives.   Black appearance.   A rough pour yielded a nice dark tan head; nice lace.   Dark cherry, milk chocolate, oak & mild bourbon notes in the nose.   Thick, smooth mouthfeel.   Dark cherry & fudge brownie flavors up front; mild bourbon & mild oak notes on the finish.   A dessert treasure; rich yet quaffable, with strong but not overpowering flavor. I'm not sure it can get better, but I'm holding back one bottle to find out....",0.6620315709939203,4.75,0.8503

Black Tuesday,"2013 vintage. Enjoyed with two friends on the shores of Loch Duich near the small Scottish town of Shiel Bridge before embarking on a backpacking trip across the nation.

Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Very good, hop bomb from the smell but not much bitterness from the taste.

Haze,"had this from a 2L growler. The look of this beer is truly amazing. almost orange in hue. the scent is also spectacular with heavy fruity notes. If that is your bag (i.e. super fruity NE IPAs) than this is the perfect beer. growler brew did go pretty flat very quickly, but this is probably not unique to Treehouse brews.",0.6327596970321363,4.5,0.85

Flavor with notes of pine, ruby grapefruit, slightly toasted malts, passion fruit, green resin, spicy and floral hops, a drop of coconut water and tangerine. Dry and bitter aftertaste. Medium velvety body with appropriate carbonation. Alcohol of 8% is very well hidden. Floral, tropical, spicy and resiny DIPA. Intense, but also hoppy balanced with high drinkability. It does have layers of hoppiness. Starting lupulin green, then spicy and lastly tropical. Classic, good stuff.",0.6986496263293732,4.25,0.8499
Juicy,"L - pours a burnt copper rusted orange. Clear... until the bottom of the bottle and the yeast sets in... dun dun dun...  S - pungent straw and lemon. Definitely got some funk. Some tartness and a pointy, sharp vinous punch. Much darker than your traditional saisons.   T - more of the nose, with an even sharper flavor. Is there some booze in this? Tart and astringent lemon and hay. Twangy orange citrus. Deeply earthy, fruity flavors and a mixture of red and white wine. Raspberries and other medium hue fruits. Kalamata olives in the finish and a slight citric acidity that might be booze, might be hops, might be yeast?   F - ultra smooth and creamy, especially for a saison. Rich, low carb, embodies its name perfectly.   O - juicy, not so much in flavor, but definitely in texture, flavor profile, and everything else.",0.6858462673878045,4.5,0.8497
Todd The Axe Man,"From a 16oz can, dated 11/29/16. Served in a nonic.  Pours a hazy bronze-gold with a meager half-finger of head, gone too fast to really get a good look at, and very little lacing. By the time I get it to the sofa it looks like it was poured yesterday.  Smells of peaches, pears, pineapple and cantaloupe with faint notes of balsam and cookies.  The taste is beautifully bitter with pineapple and papaya, grapefruit pith and seville orange overlaying a crisp sugar cookie body. Finishes with more grapefruit, piney, resinous hop oils on the tongue and a boozy smoldering in the gullet.  Feel is thick and slick, a little soapy, medium-and-a-bit bodied with so-so carbonation and some boozy warmth.  Overall, this is a resinous hop bomb but built over a satisfyingly substantial malt body if a little lifeless in the glass. But, still, a great-big, flavourful AIPA.",0.6726619002562869,4.0,0.8496
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"2018 vintage.  A: Pours black with a cap of dark brown, espresso-like head that recedes quickly to a sharp ring. A few streaks of lacing and pretty good retention for the little that’s there.  S: Dark roast, milk chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla. Decent but nothing exceptional.  T: A bit strange: like a dark roasty bourbon. Light oak, vanilla bean, cola, and some pepper. Very light sweetness, but overall fairly dry. Long finish with a firm, moderate bitterness and more bourbon. Less sweet and more bitter than recent examples of the style.   M: Full bodied, not quite thick, with medium-light carbonation. Smooth with a wisp of stomach-warming alcohol.   O: Solid effort but nothing exceptional. Along the lines of a CW BBS: hits the spot if you really want something barrel aged, but not something you’d crack for a special occasion.",0.6725693594333151,4.0,0.8496
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"L: Light red pour with medium head and lacing, turning to dark crimson on the dregs pour.   S: Light funk, red wine, and raspberries.   T: Very tart, balanced nicely with fruit sweetness and a vinous barrel quality.   F: Finely carbonated with a dry finish.   O: A very nice fruited sour that opens up as it warms. This one hits some highly acidic, sometimes vinegar-like notes which may be too much for some people, but overall, the flavors complement each other well. Very enjoyable.",0.698775120156135,4.5,0.8495
Todd The Axe Man,"Consumed 8/13/19  A: Medium golden orange - hazy but not a turbid slurry, could pass for chill haze - pours with a medium sized off-white head but fades quickly to just a small collar  S: Citra and Mosaic play well together - orange zest, floral citrus, orange and grapefruit juice, with hint of lime - notes of pine and tropical, herbaceous aromas - lightly fruity overall - hoppy but with Midwest sensibility, as there is some malt here to balance - pale grains, light biscuits, malty sweetness  T: Citrus, with primarily orange and grapefruit juice, zest - floral citrus as well and a spritz of lime - Citra seems more prevalent than the Mosaic, but the Mosaic is here with its signature combination of herbal, grassy, pine-like tropical notes - more malt than ""NE IPA,"" of course, with a nice graininess that reminds me a lot of other Surly beers - pale malt, cracked grain, grain tea, light bread, light biscuits - medium bitterness overall - lightly sweet overall  M: Medium body, medium-low carbonation, more crisp than smooth  O: Axe-cellent  I'm still not clear on how some of this appeared in MA recently, but what is important is that I am drinking it. If everything gets to be its own style these days, then Todd the Axe Man is truly a Midwest IPA. It's a bit more aggressive than Surly's own Furious or Bell's Two Hearted, but it's in the same family. I happen to like this style.",0.6957281649968966,4.25,0.8495

Madagascar,"2016 vintage. Not super dark, slightly thinning edges, mild head that quickly fades, minimal lacing. Smells great-wonderful mix of Bourbon barrel and vanilla with slight chocolate notes in the background. Taste is strong vanilla and mild chocolate roast with an almost perfect barrel presence-starts slightly hot with an alcohol burn, but then mellows out as the taste spreads through my mouth. Sweet, boozy, a little of the oiliness one can get from this style, just a well balanced flavorful beer. Yum!",0.6948945995271738,4.5,0.849
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Decent head production, about 1 finger of dark brown head from a moderate pour. Retention is OK for the style. Brew is viscous and black.  Aroma is enormous and boozy, featuring massive barrel notes, from the bourbon itself, to oak, vanilla, and coconut. Brown sugar, toffee, and red grapes lurk behind. Touch of char.  Flavor follows: this is as clear to the BA-RIS blueprint as the Old Rasputin anniversary beers. Bitter, roasty, tons of char; big barrel character. Significant amount of molasses and licorice on the back end, sticky and oddly sweet. Long, bitter, roasty finish, with lingering notes of burnt coffee, brown sugar, and oak.  Thick and chewy; full bodied, but very little burn for the sky high ABV. The rare bold beer you can really savor in your mouth, appreciating the flavors.",0.6590891636685893,4.25,0.8488
Swish,"East coast versus west coast, versus midwest, versus New England... Can't we all just get along? The brewers of Bissel Brothers certainly think so with a slam dunk rather than a swish. Bitter but balanced. Smooth but with a bite. Fruity but dry- Swish does it all.  Very hazy but not quite muddy, the newest New England IPA, the beer of goldenrod hues crowns with a creamy eggshell meringue. Juicy aromas of tropical fruit, citrus fruit and an herbal bouquet tantalize the nose with a tangy succulence of tropical fruit puree. Its succulence sweetness seems of the fresh juices squeezed directly from branch ripe citrus and tropical fruits with a touch of honey, poundcake and caramel added.  As the flavors bloom on the middle palate, its sweetness slowly drifts away and the full fruit forward flavor prevails. Red grapefruit, blood orange, lime and lemon come from the citrus front while mango, papaya, passionfruit, pineapple and kiwi hit the tastebuds with tropics. Trailing with an herbal medley, the firm grassiness of hops bring a bright chive, parsley and hemp taste along with supreme resinous bitterness.  Spicy, bitter and peppery, the ale trails into a malty dry texture and a creamy dryness that binds with fruit tartness to bring the character of sherbet and creamsicle in a lasting succulent aftertaste. Alcohol spice seems of curacao liquor and blend with the citrus hops and bitter herbal nature of hops seamlessly.",0.6551580103408471,4.5,0.8485
Sip Of Sunshine,"Super juicy tropical IPA, it's got tons of mango, papaya, grapefruit, and some floral hops. It's a very good beer, but I feel it's pretty standard, there isn't a shortage of great tropical IPAs anymore and I won't trade for it again. I still did love it, but it isn't any better than what's available locally.",0.6158394464506554,4.25,0.8484

Huge amounts of funk, mushroom, oak, sweaty socks, light lemon, apple, and grapefruit. The taste is tons of funk as well. A decent initial tartness, some oak, light lemon, grapefruit, and sweaty socks with a bretty funk finish. Very smooth for the amount of complex flavors happening. Medium body. Soft, chewy mouthfeel. Close to no carbonation. This beer was simply magnificent. All the complex flavors come together wonderfully.

Pours an opaque red orange. No lacing.  Smell: Lots of barnyard funk, hint of raspberry. Crazy earthy, mineral smells along with some wood. Powerful smell. Achieves a great balance that elevates the flavor.  Taste: Extremely, lemony sour. Giant funk like the nose with some oak and raspberry in the finish. Hard to describe, but endlessly complex; minerals, fruits, musty wild yeast notes melding with oak notes, with wave after wave of heavy sourness.   Mouthfeel: Light side of medium bodied.

Oude Geuze Vintage,"Ogv 12 375ml on 172207  Pours a clouded amber color with a small, soon disappearing head, which is unusual for 3F's Geuze, which normally stays coated by a fluffy lacing the whole time.  Smells of oak, sweeter blue cheese, stale malts, earthen mushrooms and a wet cellar quality. The typical 3F funk settles also in, together with a nice lemon zest sourness, softer than on their regular Geuze. Leans heavily on the oaken barrel with an intriguing sweet and sour interplay on top.  Has a soft mouthfeel with a pleasant complexity to it, amped up by an effervescent finish, holding the sourness in balance.  Tastes aqueous, almost flat, with some wood bark and muted toffee malts. Turns more wooden during midpalate with an uncompromising lemon tartness during the finish. The beer ends utmost dry, with a lingering lemon zest tartness, revealing mushrooms, mold and cream cheese.   Actually, this appears less balanced than the regular Geuze, especially next to A&G the OGV is just not as complex. Its late sourness is almost too much to take, overpowering everything else, with just a crisp lemon appearance cutting noteably through.",0.7149383078096482,3.5,0.8481

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2007 vintage opened and served alongside a rich homemade chocolate mousse  A: Medium red body. Slight pinkish hues. Thin, fizzy pink head quickly crashes into a broken collar around the edges. No lacing.  S: Bright raspberries. Nice sweetness with an underlying tartness and sourness that complements it well. Slightly earthy with decent funk.  T: Like the nose, this is all about the raspberries. Not overwhelmingly sweet, but nice and juicy. The sourness and tartness is present but is not puckering... my guests that had never had a true framboise were not bowled over with so much sourness that they couldn't enjoy it! Its got that underlying funk that most cantillon lambics have.  M: Effervescent with assertive carbonation. Medium bodied. Well balanced between sweet and sour/tart.   D: Top notch.

T: A very balanced sournesss. Has a touch of bitterness and there's plenty of cheesy funkiness and yeast. The age has done some wonderful things to this.

Just, eh.  F - Full for the style. Almost rich.  O - Bit disappointed by this one as this is the first Vermont IPA I've had that has let me down. Kind of one dimensional.

Todd The Axe Man,"Pours a fiery orange with a solid level of haziness in such a way that when held up to the light, it looks like a Dragon Ball. Head foams up to a finger in height and white in color. Lacing nearly non-existent. Aroma is dripping with hops. Tropical fruit, papaya, pineapple, with a good resin stick in the back. Biscuit and sweet malts help substantiate the aroma. Flavor profile is less tropical fruit then the aroma, but still features papaya, with a hint of tropical fruit beyond that. Biscuit, sweet, and bready malts give the flavor profile a hearty drinking consistency. Finish is resin, with a glimpse of pine hops. Mouth feel is medium in thickness, with a smooth feel. It has a little bit of a watery feel around the edges. Overall, a flavorful IPA that throws out quite a lot of hop notes in a balanced, and non-bitter way.

Sure Bet,"Perhaps I just don't get it. That's possible. But this pours viscous, not just hazy but dull, little head retention or leaving. It's opaque and ugly. Yes, kinda like mango juice ... But we're adults and this is beer, right? No accomplishment in just dumping a bunch of puree in your beer. Aroma is hot, a lot of alcohol. Flavor is hot as well, but the mango comes in along with a very peppery bite. The nuances of the hops are lost. The feeling is heavy, thick, almost chewy. It's good but seems really unrefined. Tired Hands Mago Tago does a similar thing with a great deal more finesse.  NOTE: So, this seems to be WILDLY variable batch to batch. I just had another batch that was phenomenal.

Scaled Up," can dated 10/4.  Pours murky gold with a thin, short-lived head. Minimal lacing or retention.  Aromatics blast off with plenty of pungent hops. Candied grapefruit, resinous weed, pithy pineapple, and tropical fruit. Medium bodied and tacky. Carbonation on the lowish side. A carpet of hops on the palate with a nice combo of dank and tropical, and a hint of pine running under. Very dry with zero malt.  Finishes with lingering earthy, resinous hops and very dank.   Great IIPA. Nice hops all around and dry enough to keep the beer extremely drinkable.",0.6756886718673587,4.5,0.8434

Swish,"After hearing all the hype about this brewery, finally had a chance to taste a couple of their offerings. Unbelievable citrus once can was cracked. Leaves a ton of melon on the palate.

S: Oaky vanilla, bourbon, brown sugar and toasted caramel dominate, as expected; everyone who has had this beer and its variants must know what I'm talking about. Huge sugary-sweet stout with overwhelming caramel, vanilla and brown sugar notes, and just enough roast and dark chocolate to keep it interesting. Lots of hot, boozy bourbon here as well, though for near 20% this is a pretty manageable nose.  T: Bourbon and brown sugar, plenty of caramel as well as vanilla & bourbon...milk chocolate, burnt sugar, boozy & oaky vanilla.

Enjoy By IPA,"12oz draft pour into a snifterloudy boasts a clear, mirror bright, orange-gold body and floats a persistent 1/4in cap of tightly bubbled head. Constant rising bubbles and a spotted lacing.  Aroma is mostly piney, grapefruit pith with a hint of spicy hops.  Flavor is dank, citrus grapefruit and a head-hitting sense, not flavor so much, just an understanding, of alcohol. The flavor of citrus hits the tongue first, thins to clear liquid, then explodes into ""what did I just do?"" dank alcohol.  Mouthfeel is both full and thin at the same time. At first the flavor fills the mouth and nose, intimidating the tongue, which, protecting itself, backs off while the feel thins, before the the back of the mouth and tongue remind you this is more than your regular IPA. Imperial, in fact.  Overall it is a very complex beer and I appreciate Stone's ability to produce it at such high volume.",0.6866615254929246,4.0,0.8402

T: Citrusy hops with moderate malt sweetness. The beer finishes dry with a light lingering hop bitterness.   M: Medium-Full bodied with moderate carbonation.

Green,"Poured to a tulip glass.  A: The body is glowy yellow, having a perfect color and on top, a half a finger thick white head with lots of retention and lacing. S: The aroma has some small citrus tones followed by a giant resinous and hoppy profile. It's promising. T: The taste is very simple and straightforward, yet, tremendously good - it begins with a pineapple/mango sweetness, getting also some tangerine sweetness, suddenly turning to a bitter basis, coming from hops, pineapple and citrus, specifically tangerine. It's very good to see a simple taste like this being brought to beer these days. M: Body is medium to medium high. Carbonation is perfect. Bitterness is high. O: Probably my favourite IPA so far.

Chocolate Rain,"2015. 18.4% ABV.  Like with all the other Weekday pours, a dark brown color with crimson hues. Small amounts of ivory head that dissipates quickly and settles into the beer.   Dark fruit and booze right away on the nose, with hints of roasty coffee and vanilla. Lots of potent ethanol, with those expected notes of oak and char from the Black Tuesday's sweet, smooth base character. Although there's that high gravity potency, even after 3 years of bottle conditioning, both adjuncts are still very much present.  The vanilla and chocolate have held up so well in the flavors. If you have a bottle of this from 2015, now is the time to open it. Predominantly sweet, with complimentary hints of dark fruit and subtle roasty coffee. Balanced, smooth flavors. Baker’s chocolate bitterness contrasts a sweet vanilla bean finish.   Smooth and the softest mouthfeel of all the other Weekday variants. Warm, boozy, with low carbonation that is still present but not at all distracting.",0.7008298744766114,4.5,0.8382

Black Tuesday,"The biggest blackest stout I have ever had at this point. Relentless, uncompromising, bold and powerful. And the crazy thing is while it is certainly boozy it tastes less than 19.5%! The look and smell are near perfect and nail the vision of this big, bad villain of the beer world. Booze, molasses, dark chocolate, licorice, coconut, vanilla, more booze, wood, plum, caramel, and raisin. Taste is not as balanced as smell because of larger booze, but still amazing.

Enjoy by 04.20.16 I suppose it's the glass we poured into, or the temp, because the last pack I got of these would have ranked much higher, haha higher. But unlike the last this one has an astringent tinge with semi present alcohol taste. Low carbonation and pleasant bitterness that hits the sides of the tounge and roof of the mouth. I feel a slight bit more carbonation could go a long way in hiding the alcohol. Wish I could say that I'll be buying it again someday.",0.5949923971249904,4.5,0.8378
Sang Noir,"Quite dark for a wild ale. Smells fairly strongly of booziness. The taste is quite sour but has a nice blend of the bourbon and wine, although too much bourbon for my taste. The feel is a bit too thick and even sticky. The main problem is the taste is quite overwhelming so a bottle should be split among several people - very much a sipper. Still, an interesting wild ale, especially if you really like the style.",0.6614182288149222,4.25,0.8376
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Incredibly unique but just not a flavor profile that works for me. As Trillium describes, very floral. Huge lime notes. If you've had kaffir lime leaves in anything, that's the biggest flavor component. Far too sweet for me, candied. They say grapefruit, but to me I get a tangerine element, but slightly soured ... like how orange juice gets an alchohol note as it goes bad / sour. The woody note is very far in the back, buried a bit underneath a citrus pith bitterness. I really want a bit more bite / IBU from hops to bring this sweetness into balance.",0.6639038883992049,4.25,0.8375

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"I think 6 oz. draft into a plastic cup @ DLD the past two years (rating is from 4/08).  This pours jet black with no real head to speak of; perhaps a few tan bubbles scattered about. It is so thick that it refuses to leave the sides of the cup.  The aroma has the big sweet caramel malt, roast,etc from the base Darklord and adds bourbon, light oak, anise, and hints at the abv.   The flavors are intense and include roasted malt, chocolate,coffee, caramel, vanilla,oak, bourbon, and anise. There is a dark chocolate like bitterness.  Definetly full bodied, with the flavor lingering for quite some time. It is worth the time away from the tasting tables to enjoy this special brew once a year.",0.6183860551118554,4.5,0.837
Sure Bet,"It looks pretty crappy, but that's where the gripes end. It's a murky goldish brown with little head or retention.   ...but man, that aroma. Juicy, fruity mango. Pineapple. Orange. Floral notes. Banana esters.   Citrusy and tropical flavors, too. So juicy and fresh. Very bitter. Floral perfumes in the finish. Sugary sweet.   Thick and sugary mouthfeel, like a fruit juice. Finishes very dry and bitter.   The nose really makes this beer the standout that it is, and the flavor is right there behind it. A tropical and citrus showcase and one of PDubs best showings to date, and that's saying a lot.",0.6808036000647039,4.5,0.8367
Sang Noir,Had cellared and saved one of these from 2012 project. Just outstanding beer from Cascade. Complex and appealing from the beginning as a dark Belgian like sour...but then it begins to open up in the glass as the air hits it...and explodes as it warms a bit to release all the buried flavors temporarily hidden by the chill. There are so many flavors here that both leap away from the whole but also never fail to compliment the whole. This beer really needs to sit a bit in a big snifter or chalice style glass to really reveal itself. The experience is way more than worth the wait.,0.6332660237983676,4.5,0.8365
Peche 'n Brett,"Pours orange, hazy and cloudy. Smells of peach, sugar, floral, dirt. Flavor is abundant of both peach and brett (surprise, surprise) somewhat sharp, but not boozey. ABV is well hidden. I almost wish I aged this longer to get it a bit smoother, but I wanted to taste the peach before it faded. Overall, enjoyable.. but there may be better options for the hefty price tag.",0.6617853927771905,3.75,0.8364
Vicinity,"Damn this is good. You just can't get tired of all those Trillium D/IPAs. This one features Galaxy, Citra, and Columbus hops. Has the expected appearance of opaque juice, like pineapple or grapefruit juice, that is. Aromas of tropical citrus are followed by a splash of fresh juice with lots of orange, brighter moments of something vaguely lemony, and a finer thread of something akin to wine grapes. Tingly, bright, zesty, tangy - medium-light feel, the hum of carbonation - another killer beer for sure.",0.6674957016690972,4.5,0.8362

Beatification,"1260th Review on BA Bottle to 5oz taster Not sure batch  @Beachwood's BBQ Long Beach- Ode to Lambic  App- A very cloudy light to medium yellow with a good density and particle behind it. Zero head on it. Flat pineapple juice that really looks like Campbells soup to me.  Smell- A fresh field of hay in a glass. A lot of backing lemon and a bit of wheat. Not overly sour smell, more tart.  Taste- A small sour note to say the least and at 5.5%, dangerously drinkable. A good balance is struck between the lemon, wheat, tart, funk wheel of flavors.   Mouth- Punchy lemon flavors abound in this one with a light to medium body and a fairly light crisp carbonation level. A bit damp on the finish.  Drink- It's good, but didnt blow me away. I can see what the fuss was about though and very glad I have another bottle at home.",0.6997785456115188,4.0,0.8359
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"So...yeah, I had one full glass of OA Dark Lord an hour ago. It's was horrendous. I got my toes crushed by the keg and then when I tasted it after waiting a couple hours for it, it just was a huge let down.  Looked pretty good, the smell was average of average DL, no Vanilla or Oak in the scent.  Taste- Wow, this sucks. I'm sorry, normal '09 DL = OMG. '09 OA DL=bad. No taste of Oak at all and overpoweringly sweet. The few drops I had of Kaggen and Surly Two beat the shit out of this brew.  Mouthfeel- Good, just like normal DL, thick and delicious.  Drinkability- It tasted awful, somewhat like '08 Darkness awful. I can see if people like it, but it had no taste of Oak at all. NONE. No wood.

Flavor is light on the tartness. Dominated by funk quality.   Carbonation has fallen out some leaving it pretty smooth in the mouth. Dry.   Pretty damn refined right now. Quite a treat to try.,0.6922462276604219,4.75,0.8357
Nelson,"From a fresh growler, pours a light orange-gold, slightly hazy and with a greenish tinge around the edges. Head is a solid 2 fingers, dense and white with very fine bubbles. Lasts a long time and never completely fades. Initial smell is dankness, mixed with an herbal spiciness. Also a bit of ripe fruit and something like sweet hay. Taste is spicy, earthy herbs. Finish is bitter grapefruit and lingering spice. Feel is an outstanding balance of pleasing smoothness offset by prickly carbonation. Killer IPA, very unique.",0.7127338975330597,4.5,0.8357
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Poured dark and thick. Aromas of oak, vanilla, whiskey, and dark chocolate. Drank very nice and smooth with the oak and dark chocolate flavors coming through well. Delicious",0.6123452155096136,4.25,0.8357
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Back as pitch with a thin and light tan head, wonderfully rich coffee on the nose, less bourbon than typical for the brewery but still added to the otherwise simplistic brew. This is in my top two or three for certain though as what it lacks in complexity it more than makes up for in execution and refinement!",0.7345467048438342,4.75,0.8356
Black Tuesday,"Look: Dark coffee color, no milk. Light brown head. Smell: Caramel, toffee, dark chocolate, sweet bread, dark grains. Tres leches. A touch of alcohol and bourbon.  Taste: Rich, robust, and gigantic. See above. Vanilla, maybe some coconut. Alcohol is in the taste. I taste awesomeness.  Feel: Heavy. Low carb.   Overall - Good to go!",0.6484883496702379,4.75,0.8356
Beatification,Tried a pour at RRBC. Pours a bright yellow color. Little to no carbonation. Smells awesome. Funky sour smell with white wine and apple. Taste can be descibed like the smell. Sour and tart with heavy presence of white wine/grapes. Very smooth mouthfeel and not overly sweet. Very good experience.,0.6583176973133648,4.25,0.8356
Enjoy By IPA,"Enjoy By 4.20.16, bottled 3.4.16, poured 4.9.16 Creamy orange golden body, half inch head Smell is a forest of hops, apricot, mango, pine, breadiness, lemon zest A bitter floral hop at the front of the mouth, some fresh cut grass behind it Slightly abrasive/harsh feel A very rich hop experience that I wish had more fruit or malt notes to smooth it out, but as too-hoppy beers go this is really good",0.6721616505603554,4.25,0.8354
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Made my first trip to Trillium this past Friday and picked this up along with 9 other bombers.  Appearance: Pours a luminous and hazy golden orange. About two fingers of super creamy head. Quite a bit of lacing. Really digging the look of all of these Trillium beers: they all seem to glow in a glass.  Smell: Didn't need to stick my nose in this one to dig out any aroma, that's for sure. Absolutely massive assault of lemon and lime zest upfront, with some grapefruit and orange aroma at the backend. Almost gives me a bit of a lemon shaved-ice vibe. Very assertive, but very crisp.  Taste: Damn, if the nose was assertive the taste is even more so. Huge pop of bitter lemon and lime that segues into an orange candy aftertaste than becomes more apparent as the beer warms. Huge flavors at play here.  Mouthfeel: Considerably thick and juicy, but finished remarkably dry. If anything, the initial pop of bitterness is a bit aggressive for me; very prickly on the tongue and front of the mouth. I almost think I'm detecting alcohol here, but I'm fairly positive it's just aggressive hop oil flavors.  Overall: A crazy-delicious beer that's only downfall is just that it's too assertive to be balanced. That said though, damn. Wish I had purchased more than a single bomber of this. Curious to see how DDH Congress Street fares in comparison to this one.",0.6885691165965744,4.5,0.8352
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"Pours opaque, jet black in color with 1/2 inch head. Taste is deep cocoa, milk chocolate, and coffee. Medium bodied, sweet, roasty, with medium-low carbonation. Makes for a really good stout. I prefer some other Tree House stouts more, but this is really good.",0.6482672041551746,4.25,0.8349
Sip Of Sunshine,Had this on draft in Burlington.   Served in a snifter glass. An orange hazy color. Thin head which faded quickly.   Fresh citrus aroma with a hint of grapefruit.   First drink had lots of citrus flavor. About halfway through more bitterness and then the grapefruit.   Extremely drinkable and impressively balanced for a double IPA.  Overall a fantastic DIPA. I will definitely be looking for more of this one.,0.732880452991261,4.75,0.8347
Green,"Pours a pale yellow color with some haze to it. Fluffy head leaves plenty of lace. Aroma of dank, tropical fruits, and perhaps some citrus. The flavor has mango, papaya, and pineapple flavors. Really bright tropical notes and plenty of bitterness backing it up. Super drinkable and smooth on the palate. Really a very nice beer.",0.6702596770457461,4.25,0.8344
Scaled Up,"Bottled on 12/17/15 so not super fresh, but it doesn't matter. Pours a hazy orange yellow color with a thin white head that leaves blotches of lacing around the glass. Smell is loads of pineapple and mango, with some citrus. Taste is full of pineapple and mango. Sweet malt helps elevate those tropical fruit notes. Bitterness is there but only slightly. Helps with the grapefruit in the back end. There's some dankness in there too. Alcohol is barely noticable. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. That signature Trillium feel. Kinda sticky though and carbonation is kinda low. Overall, an amazing DIPA. Trillium really knows what they're doing with hops.",0.6681171203810099,4.5,0.8344
Madagascar,"L -- 1,000 lumens passed through the glass reveals a very dark brown body with total clarity. Scant half finger of mocha colored head produced with moderate pour. Minimal retention or lacing S -- Vanilla, milk chocolate, boozy bourbon, oak, toffee, fruity coffee T -- Largely follows the nose, although not really getting any coffee. The vanilla is definitely front and center here, and it works quite well. Bourbon barrel character becomes more apparent the more you drink and discern.  F -- Medium+ mouthfeel, medium- carb. A little limp around the edges and the carb is a hair on the prickly side, but nothing much to complain about here O -- If you like vanilla, check this one out. Unlike most BBA stouts, this should be served at near-fridge temp as opposed to near-room temp.  88/100",0.6459626139745689,4.25,0.8343
Nelson,"Worth the hype. Happened across this while on a trip to San Francisco - on tap at Hogwash. This is a stand out among IPAs.

Todd The Axe Man,"Canned 08/06/2019.  L: Cloudy golden color, off-white head that doesn't last very long. S: Pine with some citrus notes underneath. T: Generic citrus, a bit grassy bitterness. Bitterness comes mostly on the finish. F: Medium body, not sticky or syrupy. Very easy drinking.  Great IPA. Citrus flavors are excellent but Mosaic gives it the herbal grassy bitterness that I want in an IPA.

Sang Noir,"One of my first wild ales, and one that I will not forget! It definitely leaned towards the sour side, but was well-balanced and not too puckery. The appearance and taste were both outstanding. Poured a dark red/brown color, with a decent amount of head. Lacing lasted until the last sip, and really helped capture the aromas. Worth trying if you can manage to find.",0.6792698826380091,4.5,0.8336
Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Pours a mostly clear yellow orange with two fingers of white head  Smells of light funk, lemony citrus, earthy, oak.

S - Big bourbon and vanilla!  T - Intense! It took a while for my palate to calibrate. Big bourbon with dark chocolate, molasses and roasted marshmallow. The alcohol is intense and there's a moderate sweetness.  M - Thin with a low carbonation.  O - Too intense for me. I may as well have had a bourbon. But I can see what others love about it.",0.6414070456468325,3.75,0.8331
Beatification,"Batch 5, courtesy of a business trip to the Bay Area. Sampled on 6-6, reviewed from notes.  A: Lemon rind yellow. 1/4"" head and plenty of carbonation bubbles. Looks ripe.   N: Soured oak staves. Some acetone and barnyard funk. Lemon/sour citrus. There is an unpleasant scent wavering through this which knocks off some points.   T: Probably a 9/10 on the sour scale. Plenty of lemon citrus, and plenty of lactic acid. Great wood base to round things out. SOme pine/earthiness, but not in the way you'd get from hops.   M: Light and spritzy  O: This is really brilliant stuff, particularly if you're in the mood for a palate scraping sour. Highly recommended, and I think RR has finally caught up to Belgium. Depends on if you're in the mood for a 'rounded sour' or a bracing one.",0.655771068481431,4.5,0.8329

Swish,"16oz can from the brewery.   Had a can fresh and held on to the can for 2-3 weeks in the fridge, it actually pours semi-hazy and does not look like a milkshake. Lacing is amazing. Big fresh and zesty citrusy nose, hint of fruity alcohol and grain as well. Mouth feel has some body, mild carbonation. Sufficient hop bitterness for the style. Pithy and rind-like hop flavor throughout. Some graininess, silky and slick. Good flavors but a bit muddled. Without a doubt worth a try.",0.6942248431898613,3.75,0.8321

Juicy,"Had this at a share out of a Hill Farmstead taster glass. Juicy was a beer I'd been looking forward to for a long time since I missed out on the opportunity to try the first batch. Honestly, overall I was fairly disappointed with it. Maybe my expectations were too high for it, but it didn't come close to my hopes or what I felt like I should be getting after trading for it. We opened a Vera Mae earlier in the night which I much preferred to Juicy. Further, I don't think this compares to some of the other saisons/wilds that Shaun makes.",0.5453002120256387,3.75,0.8316

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"About as nice a looking head as possible, thick light brown foam that pulls back fairly quickly, leaving a nice, sticky lacing. Smell is quite complex, as chocolate, molasses, vanilla and anise play equal role. Taste is similar but more pronounced as dark chocolate, vanilla and molasses coat the mouth with a little bourbon poking in on exit. Feels pretty thick, and leaves behind the taste of having just done a shot of a lighter, blended whiskey.",0.6635709654794657,4.5,0.8316
Green,"a can dated 7/18/19. Another superb TH IPA.

Sang Noir,"This was a huge beer, it was incredibly thick and heavy on the palate, which is why I knocked a few points off the feel, as it was way too heavy for a sour. That said, it was well executed. You can taste all of the elements involved. The spiced red ale base blends together well with the bourbon and wine barrels.

Madagascar,"I think that this beer is unfairly pitted again Vanilla Rye and Fundamental Observation, which is where it draws its criticisms. On its own, this is a very good barrel aged vanilla stout, perhaps the finest use of vanilla flavor in a beer that I have had (even above more hyped beers.) There are some nice chocolate and sweet vanilla notes with a mild touch of bourbon from the barrels.   The viscosity of this beer is the only reason why it is not a more sought after release.",0.6341468008549863,4.5,0.8313
Beer:Barrel:Time,"750 mL bottle. Inky black body. Smells of strong whiskey, nutty and oaky character, and almost soy sauce malt aroma. Tastes of fudge and chocolate. Creamy and chocolatey. Whiskey kicks in with strong oak and it dries out with a boozy finish. Aftertaste is just shy of soy sauce again. Heavy and slow to drink. It's very good. I say that begrudgingly.",0.6247253481675604,4.5,0.8313
Society & Solitude #4,"Growler procured from the source from a good friend.  This one pours a hazy, murky and turbid looking mess, bright and sunshiny and so inviting. There's a one inch head, and lots of lacing.  Smells so inviting, just a fruity bomb of a beer, mango, grapefruit, pineapple, orange, and melon. I can pick out each hop pretty well in the aroma, which is cool.  This has gotta be up there with the juiciest beers ever. There's just so much here- it's like sucking the hops straight off the branch. There's tons of fruit, as described the atoroma- they're all there- with orange and pineapple being the leaders in dominance. There's a hint of catty and piney bitterness at the end, with some slight earthy flavors too. This is just near perfect.  This has a really creamy mouthfeel, with a super juicy finish, mostly juicy but slightly dry with a little bitterness. It's an drinkable it's just stupid.  Unbelievable. One of the pinnacles of American hop mastery, in my humble opinion. In my top 5 IPAs of all time. Within Hill Farmstead, only 2nd to Abner. I am in awe.",0.6584825699393666,5.0,0.8313
Madagascar,"Absolutely beautiful right from the pour. A solid finger of dark brown foam sits atop an inviting, ebony black brew. Head retention is very good for the style.  Very sweet on the nose, with bourbon, vanilla, and cream really dominating from the outset. Deeper inspection yields brown sugar, oak, molasses, and chocolate. Very smooth aroma; not the slightest bit overpowering or intimidating - likely owing to the relatively low ABV for a BBA imperial stout (sub-10%).  Flavor follows, with tons of vanilla nearly overwhelming a creamy, smooth roasted malt base which itself yields tones of chocolate, coffee, and toffee. Bourbon right on the front edge manages to get its foot in the door before the vanilla rudely shoves it away - I love vanilla, so I don't see a problem there! The bourbon occasionally makes recurrences, with notes of sweet mash, and to a lesser extent, coconut and oak.  Very smooth on the palate. No heat; slick but with a reasonable amount of liveliness. Long, wet finish, with a bit of lasting barrel influence.",0.6881556833965676,4.5,0.8313
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Vintage 2006 – split with airohead2001. Poured into a snifter  A: Dark gold in color with less head than I expected. Perhaps there’s a ¼ inch off white head that has fairly poor retention and only a faint oily layer after 3 minutes in the glass.  S: The nose is of lemon zest, earthiness and a bit of funk. Not as well integrated as others as the earthiness (dirt/barnyward) is more dominate than lemon/hay notes.  T: Nice balance of sour and fruit flavors. There’s not as much earthiness or funk as in many other geuze’s and/or sours. The main flavors I get are sour apples and strangley a little bit of butter scotch at the finish, mixed with some sour. The sour in this beer is by no means mouth-puckering.  M: A bit under-carbonated, but otherwise great aftertaste and appropriate viscosity.  O: This was a very good beer that suffered slightly from lack of carbonation and a smell that was a bit underwhelming. Still, the taste was wonderful and very balanced. Would gladly have again.",0.6926983306343684,4.0,0.8309
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Ooo. Expanding my horizons here. I’ve tried a good few hefe’s Of the American variety so was happy to find this highly rated Bavarian style, from the world’s oldest brewery no less (they must be doing something right by now!).

Sip Of Sunshine,"Hazy somewhat murky orange with a 1 inch off-white head. Aroma is the best part of this beer. Floral and tropical and jumps out of the glass. Flavor is definitely still very tropical hop character but also malty, somewhat sweet, and assertively bitter. Nice and full with medium carbonation. Great beer overall.

Todd The Axe Man,"Appearance: unappealing dark copper with a chill haze, almost no head.  Nose: mosaic is prominent with some sweet malt.  Taste: taste is pretty decent but nothing mind blowing. It's enjoyable. First you get the mosaic on the top of the Tongue followed by a syrupy finish from the golden promise. I do wish it was less syrupy.  Overall: there is no way this beer is a 99. It is under carbonated and not very juicy. Like many of surly beers it is overrated. I think it scores high is because Minnesota does not have any good ipa's even that are distributed to us. I'd give it a 92 overall. If this is a 99, what is Julius? A 150?",0.659936820857758,3.0,0.83

F: Soft and smooth not as thick as I was hoping for. Still proper tho.  O: I thought it was really good. The bourbon character was perfect IMO.,0.629938662522505,4.5,0.8299
Mastermind,"ours a cloudy blonde color with a light orange hue into my glass. Two-finger head to boot. I haven't tried any of Fiddlehead's stronger offerings.  Mango, grapefruit and perhaps a touch of kiwi greet the nose. I can't be 100% sure as hops are not listed on the can.It's very enticing otherwise.  Grapefruit hits the tongue first, followed by mango, kiwi and buttery-crisp malt.   The finish is very clean, if a little thin with only a touch of citrus remaining. Very little alcohol heat. Quaffable.   Mastermind is an excellent citrus-forward DIPA that doesn't hit you over the head with hops. It's highly reminiscent of Lawsons' Sip of Sunshine/Double Sunshine and The Alchemist's Focal Banger/Heady Topper. My only beef is the fact that 12oz cans were used instead of 16oz cans. But, for $11.99, it's a dollar or two cheaper than Heady Topper and packs enough hops to stand out in the growing citrus-forward DIPA field. Pick up a 4 pack today!",0.6611736577141802,4.5,0.8297

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2008 sticker. Never had anything like it. The funk was amazing. Rich, complex, pungent, but never off putting or abrasive. This has every aspect of funk I've tasted in a beer - dank wet hay, barnyard, funky cheese, and much more than my meager palate can take in. The raspberries are still there.

Sip Of Sunshine,"16 oz can, packaged 9/21/17. Pours slightly hazy orange gold with a medium bubbly white head that retains fairly well and leaves a little lacing.  The aroma is cracker malts with piney resiny hops and a little fruit.  The flavor is sweet soft fruit with big resiny piney hops with decent bitterness and a lightly sweet fruit finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation.  Overall, a nice DIPA. I remember it being a bit fruitier with less resin and better balanced on tap.",0.6895142612383175,4.25,0.8288
Green,"May be the best beer I've ever tasted. Tangerine, pine, pineapple, and the exact right amount of bitter. I drank with some pine salt dusted french fries and herbed chicken, and this is perfect for food. I can't stress enough - YOU MUST TRY THIS BEER!",0.6020801461744897,5.0,0.8282
Vicinity,Very cloudy straw appearance with minimal white head. Very pleasant and prominent grapefruit aroma. Taste is also a very prominent grapefruit that is exceptional.,0.6706951123067759,4.75,0.8281
Black Tuesday,"Good lord what an experience! Look is cola with some alcohol legs. Not the best looking Impy Stout by a long shot. But look is by far the least important attribute, and at nearly 20%, it wasn’t going to look like beer anyways. Nose is world-class! Bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, coconut, prunes, tobacco, leather, malts. Possibly the best beer I’ve ever smelled. The taste follows the complexity of the nose with a huge alcohol punch. Mouthfeel is velvety with a mild prickly carbonation. Overall a word class beer that might benefit from the ABV being dialed down just a tad. Worth seeking out for sure!",0.6534988116958164,5.0,0.8272

Vanilla, milk chocolate, cream & faint bourbon heat notes in the nose.   Smooth, medium thick mouthfeel.   Vanilla & milk chocolate flavors up front; cream & mild bourbon heat notes on the finish.

Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,"The beer pours a Pitch Black with a thin khaki head that dissipates immediately. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of bourbon, brownie batter, baker’s chocolate, and chocolate syrup. It tastes of brownie batter, chocolate syrup, Oreo, with a strong bourbon kick. It is full and complex, but still drinkable. This is an excellent ba stout.",0.5954474942460544,4.75,0.8271
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Thought this beer was great. Bourbon and choclate on the nose and then taste is all spice on the backend, and then the sweetness comes through.

Vicinity,Can pour into std pint glass. Nice opaque light orange color with nice head. Head dissipates but beer leaves heavy sticky lacing all the way down. Aroma is very citrusy with a little sharp dank mango in the back. Taste is amazing with citrus and tropical fruits dancing with the malt.

Sang Noir,"Thin head on a murky amber and copper body. Aroma of apricot, raisin, oak, cherry and caramel. Flavor includes a perfect degree of sour dark fruit, oak, red wine, caramel and earthiness. When you drink this one really let it sit on your palate to enou the sour degree. Medium body and moderate carbonation. This is a brief review for an outstanding beer.

Black Tuesday,"2012 edition. Poured into a snifter at Jesse's Bruery tasting  A: as black as the Tuesday it was sold on. Very little head, minimal lacing.  S: espresso, chocolate, cinnamon and vanilla. Bourbon dominates.  T: holy crap! this is the one we came here for and it's delivers. A cascade of dark fruits' featuring dates, raisins and plums. Chocolate and cinnamon do a tarantella with vanilla beans. Is that the 19.2% that's putting me in a trance? I swoon as it warms; the flavors enhance greatly. Let me take a seat. That bourbon-y finish leaves us all in awe of this liquid death.  M: Medium to heavy with chewy carbonation.  O: What can I say, I love a great stout and this one kicked my ass.

Madagascar,"2017 vintage   L- Black, decent amount of light brown head, but it fades.   S- Mostly booze with some oak. A hint of vanilla with some roast.  T- Very similar to the aroma. Not much vanilla.  F- Medium body. Not that smooth, a little booze burn.  O- It's not really what I was expecting. It's a reasonably solid BA stout, but I barely got any vanilla.

Enjoy By IPA,"07.04.19, clearly not a fair review over two months out so I'll be understanding. Gold with fluffy three finger head. Whispy clouds of particulate. Sweet malt base with soft grassy, citrus, and floral hops. Some booze. The flavor is sweet, concentrated malt with grass, citrus and lots of booze. The hop character, I think, has faded, but it's still an enjoyable enough beer. While it starts out fairly sweet, the finish is dry with medium, pithy bitterness.",0.6990114303023678,3.75,0.8257

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Bottle. F’ing semi old bottle. Cork 04 date. Pours a rich red color with a light pink head. The smell is a pungent, musty, dusty raspberry. The smell is either really good cheese or really bad meat. Tanic and basement like. The taste is very funky and intense. Acidic, lemon, funk, and fruit. Really glad I got to taste this.

Enjoy By IPA,"Look: Brilliant and crisp golden orange color. Not a huge head like expected. 1-2 finger head with a fairly rough pour. Head dissipates rather quickly, but has a nice 1/4 inch of bubbles continuously being replenished.  Smell: Not overly aromatic, but has some funk, pine, juniper, and citrus. Quite a Catty aroma.  Taste: A decent hop bite upfront. There is a battle between sweet malt and bitter hops. The hops burst first with peach, pineapple, and pine. There is definitely more cattiness in flavor than in the aroma. The bitterness backs off and then more malt flavors come through.   Feel: Light-Medium bodied. Felt a bit thinner than most IPAs.   Overall: Great IPA. Not the best, but very good. Not the biggest fan of Catty hop IPAs, but this one is well balanced with other flavors.",0.7057730826249884,4.0,0.825
Sip Of Sunshine,"Sip is a ""must buy"" any time i see that the beer stores near me have it in stock.

Beatification,"Bottled 021517. Clear yellow appearance with a good bit of foam upon pour. Foam and bubbles are similar to that of sparkling wine. Lemony, with a bit of a barnyard funk aroma and flavor. Not overly acidic/aggressive as some of the other RR sours. Oakiness does come out as it warms. Smooth and crisp at the end.   A delightful sour that I'm happy to try, but there are a couple of other RR sours I would rather have.",0.6945943315734043,4.5,0.8248
Society & Solitude #4,"Appearance: Arrives hazy and honey colored with an impressive capping; clumpy lacing all the way down  Smell: Bright and floral with tropical fruit and citrus tones; grapefruit and pineapple dominate   Taste: A hint of sweetness is delivered by the malts and the pineapple tones, up front, with grapefruit and clementine orange adding a citrusy edge, through the middle; the finish is dry but there are plenty of residual hop tones lingering   Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate carbonation  Overall: Everything I have tried in this series has been outstanding and this one is no exception",0.7222621455396044,4.5,0.8248

Beer:Barrel:Time,"Hey! It's very quiet here at the cellar despite the fact that they're pouring a bunch of one-off Ba stouts. And they have bubbles! Not so much aroma on the base, but the flavor is big, albeit balanced. Less sweet than d3. And bubbles! For me, that's the only thing that have kept the derivations from the 5 realm. Here, the only small criticisms I have are a slight lack of aroma and a little too much melanoidin flavor. Fantastico!  Revisit nov. 2017. I guess this is batch 2, or maybe what I reviewed back during the maplewood coffee crawl was a test blend. I’ll stick to my initial impressions after soloing most of a bottle. Definitely smokey off the bat, but the barrel ffittingly gets mellower with time in the glass. The maman comparisons are on point. C King may have stole his own recipe :o  Now the 2018 version: more complex and less smoke than last year. I drank a 2018 bcs last night so I was thinking about the differences. Bcs definitely more approachable. More caramel and cherry flavors. BBT is darker, tighter. More hamlet than Macbeth maybe. Tragedy we all can’t drink a bottle of either every night free and easy...",0.6395317224335034,4.5,0.8236
Chocolate Rain,"One of the best beers I have ever had. Thick , rich and insane in the complexity dept. Lots of ABV but really noticeable, the chocolate notes are abounding but melded with a lot of dark fruits and thick darkness. So good that it made me verbally say damn and stop to savour the finish.

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"L: pours dark brown with a small brown head that fades fast to the edges. S: oh yeah! Cinnamon, bourbon and sweet chocolate jump out is the glass. T: hell yeah!

All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"Poured from the can L - Pours black with a thick, but short, tan head.  S - Dark chocolate and a hint of coffee T - Dark chocolate milkshake (wife says delicious melted candy bar) with just a hint of bitterness from the coffee.  F - Impressive for 6.5% - full bodied. Obviously sweet, but not overpoweringly like some chocolate stouts.  O - Really enjoyable stout. While I'm not a huge fan of the milkshakes, the dark chocolate and coffee bitterness make it work.",0.5860768997351935,4.25,0.8227
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"I pulled the trigger on the big bottle. 750ml poured into a Russian River Belgian Stemmed glass.  Bottled 28 April, 2010.

All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"Being spoiled by the likes of Good Morning and Triple Shot, I'd say All That Is has a lot to live up to.

Still a very tasty milk stout though.",0.5744654721112215,4.25,0.8225
Black Tuesday,"Black Tuesday has to be one of my favorite beers. This is the beer I use to judge other bourbon aged stouts against, and I haven't found many that stack up to this one.

Chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate. While the stout could have easily melted in a syrupy Hershey's chocolate milk, I found that Tree House was able to integrate a few nuanced mocha, dark chocolate, and some roasted elements to enhance the flavor profile. To be sure this is a single note-driven stout, but it finds ways to deploy the chocolate flavors in a varied medley with each sip. Very enjoyable!",0.663025776693276,4.75,0.8224
Haze,"Don't bogart that haze, or so the can says. I purchased the can directly from the brewery, it has a canned date of 7/2/2019 5 days prior to the date of purchase. The beer has a beautiful haze and is a thick orange yellow color. I get a slight fruity smell on the nose, very pleasant but faint. I smell peaches, and a little citrusy scent. The taste is peachy with no noticeable bitter flavors and a good amount of carbonation. The alcohol content is also well hidden in the flavor. The beer has a thick mouthfeel and is very smooth. Haze is a good representative of a New England Double IPA.",0.6473478615656859,4.5,0.8223
Green,Look: A solid hazy orange that I cannot see through. There was only a small amount of head to it that quickly went away after a soft pour. Smell: Definitely notes of citrus. Was a fairly enjoyable smell that I didn't find that innovative. Taste: Primarily mangoes and with a lesser note of pineapples.  Feeling: There is a soft pleasant tickle after finishing the mouthful.,0.684586736690729,4.5,0.8222
Double Orange Starfish,16 oz can poured into nonic pint canned on 4/18  A: not much of a head body and is a murky orange tan.

Caffè Americano,"Appearance: Poured viscous motor oil with a thin layer of tan head that disappeared quickly.   Smell: Immediate notes of Americano coffee. Very robust, rich, and assertive to the nose. Coffee gives off bitter cocoa and slight dried pitted fruit. Just slight hints of fragrant vanilla. Overall very warm and inviting.   Taste: Robust coffee from start to finish. Even the aftertaste remains rich in coffee, leaving a roasty bitterness in the mouth. It's interlaced with semi-sweet chocolate, making it almost dessert-like yet still contributing a slight char and bitterness. There is also hints of smoke and dried cherries, enhancing the complexity. Maybe just trace of vanilla, nothing more.   Mouthfeel: full-bodied, rich, and silky.   Overall: A solid beer that really showcases quality coffee. Vanilla was pretty minimal but the coffee makes up for it.",0.7113779875730615,4.5,0.8221
Swish,Hop and juice bomb! The look of this beer is also pretty amazing with a glowing orange/yellow integrated haze. The flavor is strong yet nimble with no lasting bitterness on the palate. Awesome beer.,0.6794446399470189,4.75,0.8221
Beer:Barrel:Time,"Stark black with a thin, burnt yellowish-tan ring.  Very woody and quite nutty up front, stinging hot bourbon collides with every aspect, bringing with it plenty of waxy oak. There are notes of cocoa, walnut, and smooth dark chocolate, but that bourbon just dominates to a fault.  The body is medium to thin and a bit sticky, and the finish is dry.  This is glaring proof that you CAN age a stout for too long in spirit barrels. Or, perhaps more appropriately, that the hype is not always real. I get that everyone wants to try the shiny new thing, but I'm really glad I got to try this on draft instead of trading away half a cellar of far better beers.",0.6509904770198892,3.5,0.822

Mastermind,"Had on tap. Grassy and herbal hops fill the nose, with underlying dankness, pineapple and other tropical fruit, but not overly bitter.

Todd The Axe Man,"Not sure if I had an old one or not, but out of the can it was orange with an unfiltered look not indicative of a West Coast IPA, so not sure where they got that one from. Reminded me a lot of OTWOA by DC Brau.  Taste: Too malty. Again, not West Coast.  Can't see how this beer achieved a 99% rating. An almost perfect score with IPAs like Building 8 or Societe out of SD and about 50 others that should rank well above.",0.5534981485013002,3.0,0.8218

Mastermind,"Poured from a 12 oz can purchased at Beverage Baron in Barre, VT on my vacation. Date on can is 10/2/14.  Pours a hazy, straw color with a thick white head that had nice lacing and retention. A little paler than I usually see in a DIPA.  Smell is fantastic. Lots of citrus and tropical fruits with some earthy complexity.  Taste was grapefruit, peach and mango. Less bitterness on the finish than I expected.  Feel was a little flat and left me a little disappointed.  Overall, another great DIPA from Vermont that could be excellent with a little more carbonation and bitterness on the finish.",0.6761629867717713,4.25,0.8215
Todd The Axe Man,"Can poured into a Russian River Brewing Co nonic pint glass  A: Pours slightly hazy golden orange amber with a frothy off white head that settles to a nice layer and leaves some spotty lacing.   S: Fruity, tropical and orchard fruit, some citrus, underlying dank and resinous pine, biscuity almost bready malt, and caramel sweetness.   T: Resinous piney undertones do battle with juicy citrus and tropical fruit, orange, apricot, mango, lemon lime, passion fruit, pineapple, peach, slightly dank, biscuity malt, and caramel sweetness.   M: Medium body, moderate carbonation.   O: Lucked into finding this can while on a road trip. Probably just a bit past its prime, but still a very nice beer.

Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"(on tap at Pinocchio's 9th anniversary event... served in a 5 oz snifter)  Rather mute and one-note, with only a little bourbon presence... big dominant flavor is that of a malty dark chocolate chip milk; luckily not a sweet and syrupy chocolate, but chocolate and little else... little roast, little char... I do fondly remember the delicious flavors of Elijah Craig 12-yr, and there was very little here to reminisce about... really dangerously smooth, with the alcohol very well hidden, but probably wouldn't buy a bottle",0.6004653187668295,3.75,0.8208

S- On the nose I get citrus hops consisting of mango and peach,with some pine and floral hops as well.There is also a nice dank aroma to this IPA.  T- The palate follows the nose with citrus hops up front ( mango and peach), floral and spicy hops in the middle,and a bitter pine hop punch on the back end.Dank after taste to it as well.  F- The mouth feel is medium with a sticky texture.Medium amount of oxidation on the tongue.Slightly dry yet smooth finish,with a somewhat chalky texture after the sip.  O- This is a very good IPA,I wish I had picked it up at an earlier date,it probably would have been even better.Can't wait for the next version to come out.Highly recommended to IPA lovers,and hop heads.",0.6692991377624098,4.5,0.8207
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Best Jackie O's offering I've had to date, including BBBM. Just an outstanding balance of flavors. Lots of chocolate, vanilla, coffee, bourbon and some nuttiness with the roasted malt. Everything comes through balanced and not ""too much"". Reminds me of the balance of added flavors that BOMB! has (one of my favorite flavored stouts). I will be seeking this out again.",0.6836155689831384,4.75,0.8205

Mastermind,"Pour is bright golden amber with a light haze and lots of tight white head. Nose is sticky caramel, slightly stale grain, a bit resinous and good bit of grapefruit and citrus. Taste is a bit cleaner, less grain but it was a bit stale in the nose, still some sweet sticky malt foundation but not overpowering, loads of citrus and dusty grapefruit, resinous hops mostly cleaned up. Light body and moderately carbonated, gentle bitterness through the finish and a soft feel.",0.6947836719312117,5.0,0.8201
Oude Geuze Vintage,"largerdeer shared a 750ml bottle of this gem, vintage 2007.  Pours a hazy golden color with a small white head that leaves a ring.  The aroma is great - typical 3F - very funky with horseblanket and pigsheet and lots of oak -bal.  Flavor is very good. Funky horsey cowy barnyard, pale malt base, oaky musty -bals, and a great tart finish. Maybe a LITTLE blander than your typical 3F gueuze, but I'm splitting hairs here.  Medium-bodied and very smooth with lots of acidity on the finish.  Really solid brewski overall - I could have twoski.",0.6862406788239267,4.0,0.8201

Double Orange Starfish,"32 oz Crowler. Pours opaque dull orange with thin white head that leaves little lacing. Big orange pineapple aroma, weedy hops.

Excellent IPA.",0.6551922345650483,4.5,0.8201
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Bottled April 26, 2011 - Poured into some Goose Island stemware. Beautiful cherry red body with a thin layer of pink foam. Musty barnyard brett and lightly soured cherries on the nose. Wet hay and a bit of cheese. The flavor is filled with dry, tart, cherries and light, earthy, malt in the background. The cherries in this are excellent. The body is smooth and creamy with a nice tart/sour kick. Light, spritzy bubbles. Slightly more acidic than I remember the regular Oude Kriek being. Overall, this is pretty tasty stuff. I personally like it more than the Oude Kriek, but probably still prefer Cantillon’s Kriek, especially with the $28 price tag on this bottle.",0.6524278130576739,4.5,0.8201
Haze,Incredibly well balanced and smooth. I go back and forth on whether I like this more than Julius. Pretty sure Tree House can’t make a bad NEIPA. Well done!,0.6885897363522905,4.5,0.82
Second Fiddle,"Bottled 7/26, opened 8/12. Pours clear amber, no haze, with a thick off-white head.  Aroma of mango and stone fruits. Some pine.  Mouthfeel is smooth but not quite “pillowy,” probably best aspect of the beer overall.  Tastes of caramel malt, mild hop bitterness, some fruit. Lasting caramel malt aftertaste.  Overall, a decent more traditional IPA, but not a NEIPA as others have described. Recommend it if that’s what you want.",0.6824607943196587,3.0,0.8198
Beatification,"Lost my review from the second batch, at the brewery and it's on tap so I might as well re- review. I'm saving several bottles from the first and second batch and want to compare to a fresh sample.   On tap, poured into Belgian goblet.   A: Light apricot-orange, light opacity with bubbly effervescence. Not a trace of lacing.   S: Tart front, unripe fruit and lemony vinegar. A trace of hop snap cuts the sour bouquet.   T: Again, tart as can be upfront while remaining palatable. Slightly sweet unripe berries play against an oaky dryness, touch of lingering cherry sweetness. Plenty of lemony pucker, and the whole experience is singular on the palate. Notes of white pepper dry toward the short, sour finish.   M: Super-effervescent and light bodied. Bounces off the palate.",0.6828901773553915,4.5,0.8195
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,Served at P.F. Chang's in the bottle with a nice tall glass. First time I drank this beer. I am hooked. Great Aroma some say bananna I just think it smells like malted wheat and that is what it tastes like. The head stays as long as the beer does which in my case is not that long. Love this beer.,0.5751409068486397,4.75,0.8192
Caffè Americano,"Poured a black body with one-finger head khaki head with minor lace. Mild espresso aroma of roasted coffee with some hints of lactic quality.

Sang Noir,"2014 Project 750, poured to tulip.  Pours a rich, dark garnet. One finger of head immediately dissipates to just a light ring.  Aroma has a bit of horsey funk, straw, dank wood and cherry  Flavor is amazing cherry, earth, old oak, plum and tartness. Barrel does not over power the fruit and yeast notes, wine more noticeable than bourbon. The fairly high abv entirely masked.  Moderate body with slight astringency.  I've liked every thing I've tried from Cascade, but Sang Noir is a cut above the rest. Complex and subtle barrel elements light up the wonderful tartness and cherry. Color is exquisite. Drinks a per cent or two lower than the abv actually is, so be careful.",0.7001098962852133,5.0,0.8185

Black Tuesday,"Poured 750ml bottle into snifter. Vintage 2015. Very dark brown with a 1 finger thin tan head that fades into thin ring. Active micro bubbles keep the beer swirling and dancing on the surface. Aroma is sweeter malts, chocolate covered caramel with vanilla and bourbon soaked raisins. The taste is dessert like, with caramel covered in milk chocolate. Mocha late with some raisin, vanilla and bourbon notes. Medium feel with soft carbonation and some booziness from the high ABV. Enjoyed this as an all day sipper.",0.6054154398824974,4.0,0.8176
Beatification,"Special thanks to DaveHack for opening this one tonight.   This poure out as a hazy golden color with a pretty decent white hea on top. The lacing was thin but the retention held up pretty well. The smell is strong as hell, lots of powerful sour notes on top of some subtle vinegar. Very acidic aromas. The taste follows the nose. I nearly had tears in my eyes from how sour this was. The flavors of violent oak aging with Brett and vinegar all come together in this beer. The mouthfeel is light bodied, nicely carbonated and leaves me with a salavating pucker after each sip. Overall this is probably one of the most sour things I've ever had. It's brutal and not something I would ever drink a lot of. Still it fits the style and is sure to please anyone who seeks these type of beers.",0.6778923887919278,4.5,0.8176
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Pitch black, light creme colored head with some minimal retention Inviting, warm smells of sweet malt, honey, maple almost, some slight whiskey tones come through Dark fruit, dark chocolate, raw honey, heavy oak/woody presence, finishes with a strong whiskey taste Chewy feel but not quite as expected, a bit more syrupy than full bodied Heavy on the barrel, I like it",0.6760552721098155,4.5,0.8176
Scaled Up,"Canned 7 days ago.   Surprisingly subdued aromas and flavors compared to some of the other Trillium DIPA offerings.

Swish,"Enjoyed at the brewery Winter 2016. Update: Canned on 2/15/17. Enjoyed on 2/20/17. Acquired in a shady trade at Treehouse. The first time I had this beer at the original brewery, on draft, perfect 5.0 beer. It was different. A can from idk when in a shady deal, 4.6/5.0.  Look: Yellow, Gold, a head that lingers. (10/10) Smell: Weed, Tropical Fruit, Nutty, Sweetness. (10/10) Taste: Weed, Tropical fruit, yeast, malt. All the flavors you want in a beer and then some. (10/10) Feel: Super smooth. A bit acidic as beer should be, alcohol is hidden well. (10/10) Overall: Drink this from the can if its not fresh at the Brewery. This is the best beer that i've tried in Maine. Period. It's like all of the best beers in one glass. The aftertaste tastes like taking a bong hit, very strong reefer taste. This may the be dankest beer I've had yet, but its also fruity as hell and you can't stop drinking it. Highly recommended, must have more! Pissed they only brew it half of the year.

Schaerbeekse Kriek,"A 750ml bottle at Moeder Lambic Fontainas. There were two conflicting bottling dates. The original label has a bottled on date of 28th April 2010 whereas Moeder Lambic added a 2015 bottling label. Whatever research I could muster up shows that there does appear to be a 2015 bottling on 30th January 2015 out there (first since 2011). Poured into a 3 Fonteinen gueuze glass.  Appearance: It poured a cloudy dark ruby red colour with a big three finger light pink head that dissipated fairly quickly, leaving very sparse lacing.  Aroma: Very nice fruity cherry and strawberry with a hint of vanilla.  Taste: Sour, tart, cherry and strawberry with some very light funk.  Mouthfeel: Light bodied with moderate carbonation.  Overall: Very nice and refreshing with great aromas. Unfortunately I have not tried the regular Oude Kriek though, so I cannot compare to that yet.",0.6391743620796579,4.75,0.8169
Juicy,"375ml bottle, served in hill farmstead stemware, thanks @blackie  Don't delay - she's a little of a slow and steady gusher. A hazed peach body and a thick creamy white head with sticky retention. Aromas of musty yeast, melon, and distant citrus. The flavor profile improves off the nose - featuring melon, grapefruit, yeast, white pepper, orange, brett. The wine barrel is light - really not much wood but a bit of a tannic finish. Expectations are naturally sky high for Hill Farmstead, so this was a little underwhelming but still a really nice saison.",0.6772318526377136,4.25,0.8162
Haze,"Big thanks to Kegatron for the growler share. Poured into a snifter appears a milky looking melted creamsicle orange color with a white head that holds well painting the glass with a curtain of lace.  Aroma is fruity orange/pineapple juice very hoppy and wonderful smelling. Slight grassiness and overall hop pellet feel with a touch of alcohol. As it breathes even more tropical hop scents emerge.  Taste is more of the same orange juice meets pineapple, mango, cantaloupe, honeydew with slight yeastiness and bitter lingering grassy pith/pulp.  Medium in body with modest carbonation. This has a creamy yeast filled feel that goes down easy. Despite tasting similar to just about every other hoppy thing ive had from tree house, this one brings a little brighter pop of fruity quality. Hell yea id drink it again if offered. This goes down crazy easy, never would have guessed it at 8%.",0.6521921856442092,4.25,0.8162

S- the nose is full of ripe pineapple with a faint trace of alcohol. T- The first thing to hit the palate is a bit of sweet pineapple. This is quickly replaced with some mild cattiness. Bitterness is very restrained. F- After the initial pour the carbonation is very restrained. Despite this the body is fairly light in comparison with many DIPA's. The overall mouthfeel is medium. O- I'm a real fan of the nose of this beer, but the taste is a little heavier on the cattiness than I personally prefer.

I wasn't as impressed with this as I thought I'd be, there are others in this style I liked better. There was a background dankness I couldn't get my brain to move past.

Vicinity,"Growler picked up from the brewery yesterday.  L — Pours the standard Trill-juice orange with a decent-sized white head produced with moderately aerated pour. OK retention and minimal lacing	 S — Mostly Galaxy on the nose. Tons of dank, juicy pineapple, mango, grapefruit, orange, tangerine, peach, and apricot. The bready malt character shines through more than most Trillium DIPAs.  T — Leads with more honey-dough tasting pilsner malts than I’ve had to date in a Trillium brew. This is quickly followed by pineapple, grapefruit flesh, slight herbaceous notes, and the same cheese rindy yeast bite I’ve had in all of Trill’s DIPAs. The yeast is a little less prevalent in this one, however, which gives it some points in my book.  F — Semi-sweet. Medium mouthfeel, medium+ carb. Minimal to no bitterness on the finish, although there’s definitely some there during the sip. Tongue-tickling	 O — Classic New England-style DIPA; unlike West Coast (and West Coast 2.0) DIPAs, which often feature caramel malts, this one has a honey-dough maltiness akin to a pils or Munich Helles Lager. I like it a lot — definitely up there with Galaxy Cutting Tiles and Upper Case as my favorite Trillium DIPA.  90/100  EDIT(8/13/18): 3-day-old can. Less intensely aromatic than I recall, although the nose remains largely the same. A little more white cornmeal character from the malts, perhaps. Still gets points for being less yeasty and hot than most of Trilliums DIPAs  88/100",0.6658598310313006,4.25,0.8143

Beatification,"Batch 4  A: Hazy yellow pour with a number of bubbles racing to the top of the beer. About a finger or two of white head sticks around for a good amount of time, and laces nicely.  S: It smells like sour tartness and not much else. Slight oaky and yeasty underneath.  T: Like the smell, I'm having difficulty describing the taste. It's basically just tart and sour with not much complexity. That's not to say I don't like it, I think it tastes very good, it just isn't much different than any American Wild Ale you could pick up off the shelf. The balance between tart and sweet is quite nice.  MF: Light and bubbly, the cork almost popped out of the bottle without any pulling. Very drinkable I would say.   O: For what this took to get I'm a bit disappointed. It just tasted a bit average for me.

Lots of carbonation streaming from the middle of the bell of the glass.  S: Funk. Brett. Oak. Lemon. Dry. Horse blanket.   T: Up front you get that burst of sour funk. It attacks the tip of the tongue. Middle of the mouth it's more creamy than I was expecting. Getting some of the oak tannic character. Really like a Chardonnay mixed with the carbonation like a champagne. Finish is very dry and leaves you wanting another sip much like other sours.  M: Light bodied.

Madagascar,Tasted from a KBBS teku on 4-7-19. The booze in the aroma was stronger than the booze in the taste. The vanilla flavor was nicely prevalent. Medium carbonation. I think with a bit more bourbon heat this would be even better.,0.6417107389495277,4.25,0.8126
Peche 'n Brett,"Excellent Sour from Oregon. Tons of peaches add nuance, some funk, but not overbearing sourness. Considering how high of an ABV this beer is, the booze is masked to perfection with a smooth finish asking for another sip. I have had it at a Chicago bar (Links Taproom) and also picked up a bottle at the Beer Temple.",0.6136683446721677,4.75,0.8126
Chocolate Rain,2014: this one wasn't nearly as chocolatey as others (so I've been told). Chocolate and a ton of booz in our bottle. The booziness was overwhelming and hid most of the chocolate and any other depth. The feel was fantastic and would love to try another vintage.,0.5531579697270779,4.0,0.8126
Enjoy By IPA,"12oz. 04.20.16 bottled on 03/15/16  Pours a clear gold with a creamy white foam head. Smells like big passionfruit, guava, mango, peach, bitter citrus, caramely bread malt, with dank pine and grass. Tastes like tropical guava, passionfruit, mild mango and peach, fresh citrus, boozy caramely bread malt, with bitter pine and dank earthy grass. Feels medium bodied, creamy with moderate carbonation.

Swish,"d 1 week ago.  Smell comes first on this one as it's the first sense touched. I feel like I'm in Hawaii being served a fruit smoothie with blended hops. Every sniff punches me with dankness, marijuana, and hints of cat piss. One of the most exotic smelling beers I've ever delved into. This should be interesting.  Pours cloudy orange. Looks like mango juice. Excited as hell.  Tastes as predicted. Up front lots of tropical fruit and citrus.... Pineapple to grapefruit. Turns into pine and bitterness on the aftertaste. This is liquid gold. As it warms, a slight taste of alcohol is detected. Otherwise, extremely drinkable for a DIPA. Hops radar is going off as I'm immediately sneezing.  Medium carbonation with a dry finish.   The exemplary Maine DIPA. Beautiful, unfiltered hop juice with a brown-green sediment containing yeast and hop particulate, ultimately adding to the aroma and flavor profile. If you're a fan of hoppy ales, this is a must try. One of the most satisfying beers I've ever had. The BB are performing magic. Even the burps taste better than most beer. New England has redefined the IPA. I could drink this every day.  94/100  I think ""The Bros"" are pissed that New England has taken over the hoppy ale scene. 85? Give me a break.",0.6411981249761044,4.5,0.8122
Haze,"Poured this into a snifter. Looks hazy and with a little color of orange juice. The smell is amazing of tropical fruits, pineapple, mango and a hint of peach.

Sang Noir,". Pours a brownish-reddish color with a small white head. Aroma is of tart funk, lots of tart and sweet cherries, oak barrel and light vinegar. Taste is complex, sweet cherries, tart cherries, light lactic acid, funk, sourness, some oaky wood, and not much of a sign of the alcohol. Very complex sour, very well done.",0.6581573728064385,4.5,0.8122

Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,"12oz. bottle: This one pours a slightly hazy golden color. There was a small off white head that leaves some lacing. Good hop nose. Mainly resinousy pine hops.

T: Sweet then bitter hit, notes of grapefruit, resin, piney flavors, minor malt, and some floral.  M: Chewy and bitter rounded with some sweetness, slight dryness on finish.

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2008 vintage bottled and picked up on first trip to the brewery in Fall of 2010, in the cellar for about a year and a half.  A-Looks like raspberry juice, the pink head quickly breaks down.  S-The characteristic Cantillion aroma is here, can pick this smell out from other locations-something about that Brussels air. Lots of fresh picked raspberry aroma still present.  T-The first drink is upfront puckering with then turns into floral raspberries, which then is overtaken again by sourness.  M-A super quick finish, the end note is sour and a bit astringent. Thin bodied.  D-Too sour for me, the wife drank the bulk of this bottle.  O-This wasn't overally exciting for me.

It is hazy though, as it should be... Nose has some nice hoppy funk but is rather restrained... Flavor is hoppy and citrusy with some lemon and a very mild bitter finish...

Chocolate Rain,One of the best beers I have ever had. Poured black and smelled like bourbon with a little chocolate. The flavor was like taking a drink of bourbon but with a milk chocolate finish. So chocolately it was almost like I had a piece of chocolate in my mouth.,0.5553997004753126,4.0,0.81
Haze,"A citrus bomb, but not overly citrusy. There is some background bitterness. It has some backbone and complexity.

Green,"From a can dated 8/22/18 from jdell15.  The beer pours an opaque like orange with a thin, soapy head and sticky lacing.  The smell is overloaded with pineapple. Orange comes in strong immediately after.   The taste is more earthy, floral, and pine with tropical fruit coming in underneath. There is a slight, lingering bitter finish that doesn't overpower.  The mouthfeel is over is incredibly smooth and velvety with light, fizzy carbonation.  Overall a very nice beer. It's more pine and floral than expected and the taste and nose don't match, but it's very good.",0.6962758102539972,4.25,0.8093
Chocolate Rain,"Pours Brown. Foamy, short tan had that lasts a little. Color is surprisingly light.  Smells bourbon, vanilla, roasted malts, caramel and chocolate.  Taste roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla, dark fruit hints, and caramel. Lots of barrel character it should be called bourbon rain instead. Finishes dry with a roasted and bourbon linger. Lighter medium body and lightly fizzy medium carbonation. Flavor is not as sweet as I was expecting but tastes amazing. The body was surprisingly thin though.",0.6533940782839616,4.25,0.8091
Flora,Pours a light yellow with a one inch white almost champagne like head. Smells of lemon predominantly. Exquisitely light tart with lemon oakiness and light character from the wine barrel. Probably the best saison I have ever had.,0.6358354741984966,4.75,0.8089
Space Trace,More boozy than many of the other Bottle Logic beers I've had. Coconut and chocolate blend into a nice taste. Actually had coconut floaters in beer. Nice beer though I feel this is somewhat over-rated. Glad I was able to try though.,0.6176426779894731,4.25,0.8085
Peche 'n Brett,"750ml bottle...another crazy hard to get peachy beer at a recent tasting. This one generously shared by jlindros. Poured into a Sierra Nevada 30th Anny glass.  A - Pours a pale golden color with a cloudy overall appearance. A short cap of foamy white head forms and lingers briefly and falls to leave a thin collar.  S - Quite bretty with some nice funk. Sweet and quite peachy, a bit cool with some herbal qualities, fruity overall with some additions of grapey aromas too.  T - Surprsingly, not all that peachy. I get other flavors - notably grapes...very juicy. A bit on the dry side, fairly earthy and lots of dry brett character.  M - Dry overall. I get the odd flavor of artificial sweeteners/diet soda. Body is light with a lighter carbonation as well. Disappointing a bit with the lighter than expected fruit aspect.  O - Had very high hopes for this beer...not bad at all, but a bit of a letdown considering my expectations. Not nearly as peachy as I had hoped...overall quite dry and earthy in character with a strong alcoholic aspect that detracts a bit.",0.6946570598360713,4.0,0.8085
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"Drank from a 12.7 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA Served in a snifter  Dark cola brown appearance. Slightly thinner in body than I anticipated. The liquid was capped by a small, bubbly, khaki colored colored crown that quickly dropped to a frothy collar. Tiny dots and streaks of lacing stuck along the glass.  The aroma was really malty and robust. Nice melding of caramel and roasted malts. Slightly sweet. A bit nutty. Bourbon notes came through big time. Super boozy but not excessively so. A subtle wet paper-like quality also detectable. Touch of smokiness too. Zero maple character however.  The flavor profile was basically a toned down version of the nose. Big and malty. This definitely had an “old school” imperial porter-like quality to it. The beer was anchored by a robust caramel and roasted malt base. Boozy, bourbon notes appeared in the center and intensified as the beer moved along the palate. More roast and lingering booze in the finish. Like the aroma, there was absolutely no maple character.  The mouthfeel was somewhat disappointing. Slightly thin for the style. The liquid contained a larger bubbled, moderate effervescence that frothed up on the palate.  I have found most of Jackie O’s porters and stouts to be pretty disappointing, and Bourbon Barrel Black Maple was underwhelming as well. Both the aroma and the flavor profile were straightforward and devoid of any maple character, and the mouthfeel was quite thin. I remember this brewery’s beers being highly coveted a few years ago. Either they have gotten significantly worse with time or people’s palates have vastly evolved.",0.6953817253818668,4.0,0.8078
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2008 bottling  Just ever so slightly disappointing. Not quite the massive fruit bomb of the best year's I've had, nor aged enough to add funky complexity. Still gorgeous, ruby-maroon with fluffy head that lasts. Deep, bold berry notes on the nose and palate, and sharp, lingering, fierce tartness. Clean, overly so in fact. A round, medium body with a crisp finish.  This particular tasting was a fine bottling I'd love to have easy access to, but not something to write home about.",0.7184824394153113,4.5,0.8078
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"500 ml bottle. Pours slightly hazy gold with a huge white head. Aroma of banana, cracker, clove. Taste is wheat, banana, bitter clove finish. Great summer beer.

Sure Bet,"Spiegelau IPA glass. Poured a cloudy, murky, orange with two fingers of off white head. Aroma smells of mango of course, with other citrus fruits and slight sweetness in the background.

It's a delicious start to the weekend.",0.6475617592147179,4.75,0.8074
Swish,"[IMG] Poured into my 16 oz Alchemist IPA glass canned on 3/23/18. Pours a very hazy yellow orange with a massive 2 finger off white head that leaves plenty of thin wisps of lace behind as it slowly settles into a thin film of bubbles. 4.5  Smell is guava, mandarin orange, papaya, pineapple, and some grapefruit rind. 4.75  Taste follows tropical front to back, guava, papaya, mandarin, pineapple, and just a hint of grapefruit bitterness in the juicy finish. 4.75  Mouthfeel is a little bigger than medium, soft feel with moderate carbonation, not dry but a tad sticky from the massive amount of fresh hops, and goes down way to easy at 8% ABV. 4.75  Overall I feel I have had a good amount of this style and this is as good as any. Just an utter juicy bomb, that just leaves you in a daze of tropical haze. 4.75",0.6451761912732098,4.75,0.8074

Oude Geuze Vintage,"This was a 2005 bottle that I had at Brugs Beertje. Poured into a goblet.  Appearance: Pours a cloudy golden amber color with a half finger of white carbonation that fades to a ring around the edge of the pour.  Smell: There is a strong tartness full of citrus and funk. The funk reminds me of the chalk caves from when we went champagne tasting. I'm getting a mild vinegar note as well.  Taste: This beer is quite sour. The mineral funk shows up along with the lemon juice sourness. The finish is sour along with an aged hop bitterness. While this beer is quite sour, there isn't a lot of bite, I assume that is due to the age.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with fluffy carbonation and a dry finish.  Overall: Not too biting, which was nice. I thought this was a fantastic gueuze. I haven't had this new, but the age seems to have done it well.",0.6490512743818075,4.5,0.8074

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"A: Ever-so-slightly less than black pour, with a quarter inch mocha head that receded so quick I didn't even have a chance to get a pic of the full head! Minimal lacing and a small ring of bubbles around the glass. S: The nose is all chocolate and vanilla. A little cinnamon appears upon a deeper sniff. Wouldn't believe this was barreled based on aroma alone. T: The front end is cacao and vanilla, some roasted malt flavor, nice bourbon taste appears midway through, then BAM, instantly after the swallow the habaneros appear. Almost breaks the cusp into the spicy territory on the finish, but the cinnamon is there to save the day and balance that heat with some sweet. M: Medium-thick body, smooth finish. O: This stands apart from all other spiced stouts I've ever had. Extremely complex and delicate for being such a mammoth of a beer!",0.6648126133800637,4.5,0.8071

Enjoy By IPA,"Reviewed from notes. The appearance had a clear golden amber colored body with a one finger white foamy head that disappears at a moderate pace, speckled lacing clings a bit. The smell had a sweet yet bitter through pine, floral, hoppy, grapefruit tones. The taste had a bittersweet through previously mentioned flavors, grapefruit aftertaste, dry finish. On the palate, it sat at about a light to medium, semi-sessionable as the ABV seems to be well hidden, carbonated spot on.

Beatification,"Pours a transluscent pale orange with champagne like carbonation. Smells of apple juicy, slightly reminiscent of vinegar. Taste is powerfully sour, fruity and mostly easy drinking.

Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"750 mL bottle. Hazy yellow. Aroma is earthy brett, very light wine, some citrus hops. Tastes has a lot more white wine. Brett cuts the sweetness of the wine. Light lemon tartness. Bitter finish. Light body. I've never been the biggest fan of Dorothy because of the abrasive character of the brett.

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Sampled at DLD '09  Pours jet black, no light, thick as motor oil. Oily and resinous on the glass. A moderate head forms and has some retention. Decent lacing throughout. Great depth from the barrel aging. Very woody and oaky with that wisp of vanilla. A very small smoky character in the back that I wish was bigger. The barrel really rounds the beer out, making the deeply roasted malts more enjoyable. Taste is much the same. The barrel blends everything very nicely. A touch of cherry comes out as it warms but it's nearly hidden behind all the other potent flavors. Body is fuller than full and is a bit chewy. Carbonation is somewhat low but manages to make the beer velvety nonethelss. This a very big beer. It drinks decent for the size but it's huge and wants you to know it. The barrel and aging does wonders for the beer.",0.6917070647560067,4.0,0.8065

Todd The Axe Man,"When it comes to Surly and IPA, there's no shortcuts allowed. Greatness will be achieved. And it all comes down to Todd, you know- the axe man to see it through. Beatings will continue until morale improves!  But those beatings probably let up a little with Todd The Axe Man which pours a hazy golden amber color with dusty silt settling, and while casting a loosely knit cap to greet the rim. Its bright hop bouquet is eye-opening- illuminating with citrus and tropical fruit and the herbal dankness that reminds us of the similarities of hops and cannabis. Fragile sweetness of light caramel and honeysuckle soothes the early palate before the onslaught of hops set in.  As the middle palate unfolds, the hops come spewing out- pink grapefruit and tangerine strike the tastebuds first with a quick follow of pineapple, dragonfruit, mango, lemon and peach. Shaking its early sweetness, the beer trends dry in order to let the hops shine. Becoming more and more bitter, the final frame is one of fresh grass clippings, citrus peel, and that herbaceous leafy cannabis charm.  Medium-light on the tongue, the beer's dry taste and texture proves to weigh effortlessly on the mouth while the taste tightens; circulating around the smooth hop bitterness and its deeply resinous grip. A long aftertaste of citrus peel and pine resonate deeply and expanding with bitterness.",0.6740360089921343,4.5,0.8051

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"750mL 2004 ed thanks to ygtbsm94. Pours a clear, very light pink with a scant, white head. Looking like an unblended and certainly not a rich looking as LP Kriek. Aroma of raspberry preserves, bright grapefruit, true Cantillon subtle funk, fresh berry yogurt. Taste is very sour, bitter citrus for balance, lemon yogurt, woody tannins, lots of geuze character more than just raspberry. The base lambic here is center stage. Mouth watering all the way. Lactic sour palate devastation. Super wet mouthfeel. 1/11/2011 8/4/8/5/16=4.1  750mL 2001 ed thanks again to ygtbsm94. Pours a fire amber red with an excellent pink head that is extremely healthy for a sour albeit a little fizzy. Aroma is unreal: so much fresh raspberry, raspberry preserves, and insanely sharp funk. Taste is sharp, ultimate level of lactic acidity, seedy raspberries, rhubarb, sorrel, and starchy earth. Palate is all consuming, zippy, dry, insanely powerful but quick on your body. What a complete devastation of the framboise category. I cannot believe it but Puzzl and others are right- there is some serious aging potential for krieks and framboise. This has become sharper and more fruity heavy with 10 years on it rather than more mellow. 2/12/2011 9/4/8/5/16=4.2",0.7123851768907828,4.5,0.8045

Pine, grapefruit rinds, some lemon and grains. I'm surprised and refreshed at how bitter this is. Medium bodied and moderated carb. Nice beer, I'm betting this is a step higher up at the brewery fresh as possible. I think the peach and mango would be stronger and really make this one.",0.6705853495478741,4.0,0.8027

Society & Solitude #4,"Huge thanks to yourefragile for sharing this one. Served in Hill Farmstead stemware. Pours a moderate peach color with a nice white head and some spotty lacing. Nose has heavy citrus and tropical notes. Mango big in the flavor, followed by heavy bitterness. Touch of passion fruit. Really bitter, but still crushable. I would have liked a little less on that for more focus on the flavor blend of Citra and Galaxy.",0.6703546820964288,4.5,0.8022

Darkstar November,"Poured from fridge temp. Jet black with very little carbonation. Nose is out of this world. Huge bourbon, vanilla, marshmallow, chocolate, maybe some cherry and raspberry. So incredibly smooth. Taste is licorice, a bit of toasted malts, brown sugar, chocolate, maple, vanilla. A tad bitter of the aftertaste, and the alcohol has some presence. Overall a phenomenal beer with beautiful body. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Amazing",0.651575104199197,4.5,0.802
Beatification,"Batch 5. Thanks to exitmusic00 for cracking this open prior to our bcbs vertical tasting.  A- Pours a bright gold with a thin white head that leaves minimal lacing.  S- Plenty of lemon juice and peel as well as peach upfront, followed by lacto, horse blanket and vinegar.  T- Damn this is sour, just tons of lemon juice, lemon peel, lacto, horse blanket, vinegar and a hint of peach.  M- Fairly high carbonation and a light body with a long dry finish with the sourness lingering on.  O- This is quite sour, but that's pretty much it. Nothing too complex and am confused why this is considered a top wild from RR. Have had a few others from them and this just seems to lack any depth their other offerings had. Glad I got to finally try it, but wouldn't really seek it out.",0.6481909181664406,3.5,0.802

Definitely a good start with a creamy off white head and a hazy copper body. Nose is hazy and citrus drenched herbal hops and balanced malt sweetness.  Rally drinkable with moderate bitterness and great balance. Hard to believe eight abv is hiding beneath the broad biscuit notes and sustained hop saturation. Well textured, with an oily, tasty, aftertaste. This is quaffable to a ridiculous degree. Eight percent shmeight percent.",0.7171420200938244,4.25,0.802

Haze,"16 oz. can dated 8/3/16. Poured into 18 oz. Belgian ale glass.  L: 2F+ typical Treehouse head with long retention, lacing, cap, and ring. Beer is hazy orange juice color. Don't leave it around your kids :)  S: It smells wonderful from 4 feet away. Closer in, you get orange, grapefruit, pineapple, and peach. There's also an earthiness on the back end that seems to be part of all Treehouse beers (something in the water in Monson?)  T: Just a juicebomb: orange, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, lime up front with a dank earthy finish. This is really very nice. I do get a tiny bit of alcohol heat on the finish.  F: Medium body, light to medium carbonation. Good drying on palate. Very solid construction and balance.   O: Would be really hard for me to choose between this and Julius if I had to.

All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"Unbelievably fluffy beer. Simply put, these were my first thoughts with this beer.  A slick, smooth pour of stark black tar raises a moderate, densely creamy milk chocolate tan foam that settles to a persistently thick convex film leaving tall, solid curtain sheeting.  Smell is milk chocolate, almond, pecan, chocolate syrup and a hint of mocha liqueur.  The full, smooth round body has a fluffy carbonation and delivers flavors of medium roast coffee, roasted cacao, lightly ashy tobacco, and sweet chocolate syrup finishing almost powder dry yet slightly sticky.  I can't say it enough, this is one of the softest dark beers ever put to these lips, and at only 6.5% ABV it seems even more impressive, particularly in this day of overly flavored, high octane pastry stouts.",0.6561941932117368,4.5,0.8016

Sour of lemons, balsamic vinegar, lightened by an absent or phantom sweetness, cherries, funk, cellar, leather and peat.   Medium, acidic and dry body with a smooth, foamy, and light feel to it.  2015 Project. Got in Rochester, NY, drinking in New Hamburg, ON, July 28th, 2018. Excellent for the style!",0.6348070318345973,4.25,0.8016
Swish,"Wow this surprised me. Pours a light, hazy, amber with limited head. The lack of head may have been part of my pour. The smell is TONS of juicy tropical fruits (Mango, Pineapple, and a bit of orange). There's a light breadiness there too. Taste is on point with smell and is VERY smooth. Not much pine/bitterness.

Nelson,The beer has a clear orange color. The aroma is spicy rye and citrus. The taste is rye and tropical fruits with medium bitterness. The rye character is very accurate.

Green,"Poured from 2L growler filled on 9/2 into a Gabriel Glas Gold stem.  Look: Pours more clear initially and then as it settles in the glass it turns into an opaque golden orange with a nice white head  Smell: Smells of cantaloupe, pineapple and orange with hints of petrol and rubber  Taste: A lot more cantaloupe on the palate with pine and grapefruit – my only complaint is there is a touch of heat from the 7.6% ABV  Mouth Feel: Nice weight with a long finish that ends with some nice sweetness to balance with the bitterness of the hops  Overall: A delicious beer that is incredibly drinkable. I’m very impressed with the quality across the Tree House beers that I’ve had the chance to try. This is not the best of the line-up, but still a very high quality IPA that stacks up against most other IPAs.",0.6706495920633042,4.5,0.7997

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2006 vintage A: cloudy, murky pink/red dirty amber. nice off-white head. S: i was surprised at how the raspberries jumped out despite the age on this. funkiness, earthiness, and barnyardy aromas mixed in. T: remember those super sour candies some kid would dare you to eat as a kid? drop a raspberry flavored one in a shot of distilled vinegar and it might approach this, only i don't imagine that would be nearly as sour as this lambic. i didn't get much of the raspberry in the taste. very dry and the puckering sourness overwhelms. maybe a touch of residual sugar woulda helped this for me.  M: the intense sourness dried my mouth out and made me crave water. i felt like my teeth and tongue were power-washed with battery acid. the sourness lingered for an hour, even after trying to cleanse my mouth with a gumballhead, cigs, BCBS variants, and water. i did get a nice frothiness and liked the fine carbonation in this, however. O: i want to be cool and like stuff like this, and will keep trying. if you're a fan of sours, i'm quite sure you think i'm an idiot and hate me right now. maybe this review will get reported and deleted like my thomas hardy's review. it's just my honest opinion, and i'm no expert. but i review as much for myself as for style, if not moreso. many thanks to whoever shared this at the alewatcher/oreo tasting.",0.6138197253314654,3.0,0.7995
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Bottled on February 14, 2007. Happy Valentine's Day, Armand. Opened on January 32, 2011.   A darker, hazier pour than the regular gueuze. Pale copper meets pastel red; a creamy half-finger head leaves thick lacing.  Light acetic acid; in-your-face apricot, lemon, granny smith apple; hay; somewhat floral. I could smell this all night long. The funk develops as time goes on: e.g., cheese rind, damp wood, mushroom.  Tart expressions of citrus and apple, lactic acidity, leathery oak, and a tannic mid-palate. There's some earthy and dried mushroom funk and as this opens I pick up more funky cheese on the finish, which tickles the tongue. The tannins makes me think of cherry pits. There's a floral attribute here reminiscent of dried flowers.   Very dry and tannic. Lower carbonation.   An excellent, dirty but refined gueuze. I have to take my time here, which is more self-incrimination than anything else. Off the top of my tongue, I prefer the regular non-vintage version to this, but we'll see how this develops over time. Both are winners.",0.6630503351368608,4.0,0.7994

Lots of notes on the nose from vanilla to caramel/Maple to figs, but the taste didn't follow suit and it mostly being Maple supported by the others notes on the nose and barrel.

I still haven't had the LP fresh, but maybe I'll score one of the latest batch for comparison. Dark mahogany color, with a fluffy off-white head that settled down after a few minutes. Aroma was full of funk and cobwebs, with the fruit present but a bit muted. Yeasty funk up front in the taste, old lambic goodness, with berry skin/seeds. Fruit was perhaps somewhat faded at this point (again, I never had this fresh), but still very present. Tartness/acidity was mellow, no vinegar here at all. Dry and lightly woody. Very good overall.",0.6708183142471078,4.5,0.7986

Haze,"16 ounce can in to an IPA glass.  True to its name, a fuzz ball of hazy golden yellow milk-water. The good old IPA glass helps yield a tall cliff of white froth, nearly 3F. The cap drops to a nice scoop and leaves fat sticky rings of lacing.  Peach and orange, light lemon, and other stone fruit. Alcohol is evident, sugar is not.   Lots of orange and stone fruit, grapefruit holds out until the end. Some underlying malted must and dust.  Creamy, hoppy, and smooth full body. Citrusy and not too juicy. Pleasantly modest sweetness and the 8.2% abv is veiled nicely.  Nicely balanced DIPA / NEIPA. It could've been a train wreck, but they pulled it off.",0.679439462442355,4.5,0.7977

This is usually a well balanced IPA for Stone, who sometimes likes to go overboard with bitterness. Some alcohol does make itself known.  Most recent: a 7/4/16 fresh on draft in the first week of June. Can't add or subtract anything significant for 4/20/17. Maybe a little breadier, and also, somehow seems like a wet hopped/hop harvest brew, with lighter, more floral notes.",0.6709881763611819,3.5,0.7943
Green,"L: very cloudy pale orange color with a finger of off white foam that fades fast S: citrus, well balanced with sweetness and bitter. Smells authentic, real citrus fruit, not a sugary mess T: orange/grapefruit hybrid. Very nice flavors, but this can is 3 weeks old and it doesn't explode with flavors.  F: very creamy, and doesn't leave my mouth dry and bitter. Nicely done O: a great ipa, but still just another ipa for me.",0.6782640598483634,4.5,0.7939

Sip Of Sunshine,"The alcohol level does not match the otherwise goodness of this beer. It is 8.0 but would be better served at 6.5. This beer is overly hyped and artificially limited.

Coolship Red,Bottle: Poured a reddish color beer with a nice pink foamy head with limited retention and some light lacing. Aroma of tart notes with cherry notes and light oak presence. Taste is also dominated by tart notes with cherry and oak notes with some more dominant then expected acidity. Body is about average for style with good carbonation. Enjoyable but maybe more acidic notes then I cared for.,0.6857221802951485,3.75,0.7935

Sip Of Sunshine,"16oz can from the batch that hit Denver for GABF. Dark orange color, super hazy with particulate floating throughout. Aroma is sticky oranges.

Flora,Florence is probably my favorite shelf Saison beer from HF so it's no wonder this one is amazing. It takes everything from the regular and amps it up with a nice tartness and oak character.

Madagascar,"Really disappointed in this, given the hype. Got big vanilla on the nose, and it was very smooth to drink, but the barrel was very faint and it didn't have a lot of pop to it. Did I enjoy drinking it? Yes, but considering what it takes to get one second-hand, it'll likely be the last time I do. This was batch 2, so maybe it's gotten too mellow since then?",0.5660044601318317,3.75,0.7914
Mastermind,"Pours opaque copper with a two finger head. Smells of sweet tropical citrus. Taste is a rush of pear-like flavor and citrus, quickly into somewhat brash bitterness. Somewhat dry, and pretty light. The more I drink it the more it tends to lean on the bitterness. Overall, not bad. Maybe a little less than I was hoping for, but not bad.",0.6827638811575023,3.75,0.7914

Beatification,"A: Hay, golden color. Almost completely clear. Oily looking head. Some champagne-like bubbles floating to the top. I like the color and clarity. Very warm color, like sun rays on a Sunday morning.  S: Citrus. Strong oak aroma. Barnyard funk. Sharp acidity, more on the lactic side. Yeast. Maybe some glue? Overall, it has a very Lambic-like profile. Superb.   T: Sourness in front of tongue. Even more midpalate. Same flavors as in aroma. Slightly bitter, dry aftertaste. Alcohol not found, thank god, because that is my main complaint about American sours (including most other RR's).  M: Carbonation is medium. Body is, of course, bone dry, but with plenty of acidity to balance.  O: Extremely drinkable. I compared this side-by-side with Sanctification and found it much more complex, sour, and balanced. Slightly disappointing, since I can find Sanctification much more easily. I guess you really need to let nature do its work without intervening to create a thing of beauty. Get it if and while you can.",0.7139476579240537,4.5,0.7913
Black Tuesday,"is an ink black gem. Head is almost non existent, just a rim on the glass. Bourbon is the star in the nose, with hot but appropriate alcohol. Mind blowing flavors paint the mouth and dominate the palate. Dark fruits are all over the place but well played. Port and plum wrap around bourbon and barrel so seamlessly. A jewel worth the fight.",0.6319129279325074,4.5,0.7913
Black Tuesday,"Don't let the ABV scare you away! When I first saw that this beer was over 19%, I thought it was going to have way too boozy of a flavor for me.

Beatification,"Bottle of b5 poured into -tion glass. The pour is hazy yellow with fizzy appearance. Minimal head present, no lacing. The aroma is heavenly. Notes of lactic acid pair with candied tangerine, tart cherries, waves of oak, and a touch of lemon zest. The taste is quite a journey starting with candied fruits, mainly citrus. A bit of oak and funk comes through next as things quickly head towards the intensely sour side of the spectrum. The finish leaves a lingering tartness on the tongue which leaves you hanging for the next sip. The mouthfeel is effevescent and the body is light. Overall, this is not only a very approachable sour with great balance, but it is damn tastey and well rounded. The hype train surrounds this one for a reason. This is a must try for anyone who enjoys sour beers.",0.6797252482692144,4.5,0.7906
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Poured from the bottle a deep, dark black with three fingers of rich and creamy mocha head. Loads of heavy lacing left behind.  Aroma of toffee, vanilla, chocolate, coffee and light booze notes.  Like the aroma, it tasted of toffee, vanilla, chocolate, coffee and finished with warm booze notes on the palate.  Medium bodied and a bit sticky with a moderate carbonation.",0.638070402242597,4.5,0.7906
Madagascar,"Pours a dark oily black with a light brown foamy head that dissipates quickly, some lingering on top. Smell is fresh vanilla and some bourbon.

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Thanks to bucketboy (Joe) for surprising us with a Lou Pepe diagonal on the day of the tasting. 11th beer consumed overall, and the first of the Lou Pepe variants. Bottle from 2002.  The pour yields an uninspiring dirty brown amber with orange hues. Not much carbonation is evident, as this one is just a bit more carbonated that tap water.   The aroma is funky and sour with overripe and rotting, festering raspberries come to the front followed immediately by some acetone. Extremely sour on the palate, but nothing lactic or acetic. The pedio has taken over this beer, yielding a warhead like sourness, but taken up 3 notches. I am guessing malic acid, but that is just a shot in the dark. A more fruity raspberry flavor comes through later, but this is again a sour candy-like fruitiness and not the authentic and refreshing bright and fresh fruit as you find in Cantillon's young fruit lambics.  I don't know what it is about raspberries that make them seemingly poor fruits for aging with bugs for a long time, but this was the second year in a row that the raspberry sour (V006 last year) or lambic was the disappointment of the tasting. I would like to review this fresh, as I imagine that how it is meant to be consumed.",0.6466025421964252,3.0,0.7906
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Will have to say it takes alot to rate a beer a 5, this one doea it. Smell is bourbon with a touch of coffee. Pitch black in color. Taste is heavenly mix of coffee with a warm finish of bourbon. Well done",0.5888017976150766,5.0,0.7906

Sure Bet,"One of Pipework's better malt-forward IPAs featuring the unicorn on the label art. This one still has a great hop character to it, accented by honey. Not too much evidence of the mango puree, just a general tropical fruitiness that I could believe was a product of the hops on their own.",0.6324709894679926,4.25,0.7906
Black Tuesday,"750mL (2010) into a snifter. Pours a semi-transparent brownish black w/ a 1-finger mocha head that settles quickly to a thin collar. Reddish light breaks through the sides of the glass. Nice boozy legs on this one.  Aroma is huge bourbon, molasses, chocolate, toffee, oak, char, caramel... the list of adjectives goes on and on.  Taste follows nose. Tons of bourbon and dark roasty malt, sticky-sweet chocolate-covered black cherries, caramel, and loads of vanilla. A rich dessert sipper of a beer.  Mouthfeel is sticky and chewy, coating, heavy, decadent.  Overall a big crazy barrel-aged bourbon stout that managed somehow to exceed my expectations.",0.6364394188552246,4.5,0.7906

Sip Of Sunshine,"Bought a 4-pack at Ryan and Casey Liquors. Can stated it was canned on August 17th. The beer has a slightly murky, burnt orange appearance, relatively thick lacing, and a medium sized head that dissipated relatively quickly. Aromas include a sharp grassy hops smell with a lot of grapefruit and mango fruit flavors as well. Taste followed the nose well with a punch of citrus bittersweet flavors at the end of each sip of orange, grapefruit, and malt. Mouthfeel is somewhat heavy with a decent carbonation. Overall, this is a great beer across all characteristics.",0.7041417349232109,4.0,0.7906
Swish,"Canned on date of either 3/22 or 3/23, I don't recall which.  Appearance - Pours cloudy and pale orange in color with a yellow-tinged, half finger head. Fair retention, breaking down to a mostly barren surface with a thin ring of suds around the edge of the glass. Not much lacing, with a few broken lines and a couple of spots making up what little there is.  Smell - Juicy, with predominant mango and lesser orange and a hint of pineapple. Touches of pine and a faint, underlying bready sweetness.  Taste - Juicy mango and citrus with a fair amount of pineapple zing. Faint spice bite. Malts come through faintly, represented by a generic white bread or crackery sweetness. Finishes much the same; very sweet and juicy, with a only touch of citrus pith bitterness.  Mouthfeel - Close to full-bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth, silky texture, then turns a fairly dry finish with a touch of chalk.  Overall - Great DIPA. A bit too much mango for my palate, but I can understand why people are head over heels for this beer. It's amazingly juicy and nigh crushable. Well worth the 40 minute wait in line.  Update: Let a couple of these mature in the fridge for several weeks. It much smoother as the mango died down and the flavors matured into a more cohesive experience.",0.6940730555404151,4.25,0.7904
Society & Solitude #4,"Poured from a 12 ounce can into a wine glass. 4.25/4/4.5/4/4.25 Pours a muddy light yellow with aggressive lacing. Smells underwhelming. Citrus peel, orange juice, light hops. Tastes great! Really thick and complex flavors. The initial impression is NEIPA, with murky fruits, bitterish-pleasant hops, and a light dryness. The endtaste though is loaded with spices, with spicy, almost savory notes. Robust, beefy, and compelling, I keep coming back for more. Overall, a wonderful IPA that may not be particularly memorable, but damn sure is tasty! recommended.",0.7271263842858845,4.25,0.7903

T - Sour cherries, oak, vanilla, Bourbon, caramel malts, Brett and other sour and funky yeasts, lactic acid, other dark fruits, brown sugar, a hint of booze.  M - Medium-plus bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth with a sour and warming finish.  D - Really nice sour beer. Great balance of sourness and barrel character.",0.6289882235650786,4.0,0.7902

Nectarine Premiere,Pours a yellow and hazy color with small yellow head. Smells of peach and nectarine funkiness predominate. Nice acidic nectarine sour which is incredibly balanced. Loved this beer,0.6656581749231103,4.75,0.7893
Caffè Americano,"Excited to have this one after hearing about it for so long, and it did not disappoint. Foreboding opaque black with a thin oatmeal colored head. Smell hits all the right notes: espresso, huge chocolate, vanilla, barley and smooth malt. The tastes is dark and powerfully creamy, the chocolate is heavy, the espresso lifts with the vanilla, there is some nuts and caramel under the surface, and the malts don't come across as super roasted, rather they are smooth and super heavy. This beer sits in the gut like a brick, but the body is creamy, somewhat airy, and frothy",0.6721168211775358,4.5,0.7893
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"750 mL bottle poured into a snifter. 2008 bottle.  Appearance - Red body. Not much of a head, but there wasn't much of a pop when the cork came out.  Smell - Still has a strong cherry flavor. Less of the Drie Fonteinen signature funk. More of a lemony acidity. Hefty oak to it.  Taste - Lemon sourness up front. Cherry flavor isn't sweet. More dry and wine like. Finishes very dry and oaky.  Mouthfeel - Mild sourness. Much more dry than sour. Low carbonation, but that could be age. Mistiness does indicate its age though.  Overall - Lacking the Drie Fonteinen complexity, but that cherry flavor is very nice. That's the point I guess.",0.6690908319022072,4.25,0.7888
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"A: Poured a hazy appearing blend of OJ and pear juice. barely a noticeable head.   S: Aromas of grapefruit, some earthy grassy hop presence along with a sweet lemon lime tang  T: Full flavored sweet Juice from Mango , pears, and that El Dorado lemon lime tang at the end to finish with. Orange and grapefruit pith with a subtle malt backbone. No caramel flavors, just straight pale malt with some dextrin to add additional flavor and body. Melon / Cantaloupe is also subdued but there.   M: medium to light body, medium carbonation, hardly visible  O: Overall one of my favorite DDH Doubles from Trillium.

Beatification,"Bottle. Deep hazy golden like the tipical Cantillon. Minimal head though. Aroma is barnyard, brett and leather but also very fruity (mango, oranges and apricot). Very wild and expressive. Taste is citrusy tart, but not very dry. It reminds me of a lemon pie with candied zests. Lemon is puckering but sweetness lingers in the aftertaste. Slight musty feel. It sure ain't a perfect beer but it taste goddamn good. It feels almost like a pure lambic and is definitly one step ahead from the regular american wild. I slightly prefer Temptation to this one, but it deifnitly hit the spot in its category.",0.6505656509732726,4.5,0.7878

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),Syrupy stout with a feel that completely coats your mouth and never surrenders.

The mosaic shines and mango/galaxy juice pours into the nostrils. Its stupid good, for some reason I keep thinking nectarine/peachy juice - one of my favorite noses. Taste is on point tons of straight juice, less danky and more resin but still smooth as hell. Mouthfeel is a thinner than most of their other big abv imperial ipas.. wouldn't describe this as pillowy but more hop forward and in your face. Still an awesome beer.",0.6473687039189899,4.5,0.7876

Space Trace,"Poured into a BL FO glass. Nose is caramel, toffee, vanilla, chocolate fudge, and coconut of course. All of these flavors coat the palate as well.

Black Tuesday,2014 vintage into a Bruery tulip. Pours black as night with a very thiiiiiin mocha head Smell is intense bourbon and chocolate with coffee behind it all. Turns more to chocolate as it warms. There is a flavor explosion in my mother f-in mouth. Like someone melted a chocolate bar into a good bourbon and mixed in a bit of coffee. A bit hot but not at all like drinking a 40 proof spirit Mouthfeel: see above Overall a once in a life time beverage experience that you should seek out and make happen.

There’s a light spicy rye sweetness from the malts and molasses. There is are very faint secondary flavors of vanilla and oak on the finish.  M:Full bodied with moderately light carbonation. The beer is a bit viscous and coats the tongue. Slightly boozy, but not definitely not hot.   O: Very smooth; for such a full bodied beer the beer has lot of complexity and depth, without finishing hot. Quite tasty!

Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Bottle from 2015  A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer topped by a dense and rocky finger of light tan head which fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing S: Smells of chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, oak, vanilla and caramel. T: Taste is fairly chocolatey up front with some coffee mixed in, some nice smoke and charred wood with some oak, caramel and vanilla and some burnt sugar. On the swallow there's more oak, roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, and slight smoke. M: This beer is fairly full in body with a slightly creamy feel on the palate. Carbonation is good for the style and slightly effervescent while the beer has a drying finish. O: Overall this is a really nice beer. It has some great flavors and complexity while also striking a great balance between all the different flavors. Nothing really stands out too tall over the other flavors.

Interesting lace as it covers the gambit of possibilities -- streaks, rings, and spots.   Prickly pine hop aroma.   While the biting hop is the strongest flavor, there's an interesting dry pale malt start. The body is very thin and the extra effervescence contributes to the watery sensation.

Black Tuesday,"2016 Vintage, poured from the bottle into a taster. Excellent mix of chocolate, dark fruit and barrel. Definitely boozy (as expected at 20% ABV) but was hoping it would be complemented by a more full-bodied feel.",0.6306930415344222,4.5,0.7845
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"This had a thin, dark brown ring of head at the top of the beer. There was absolutely no carbonation visible and it was like looking at the surface of a still, dark lake. It was black, black, black in color. Even the white bits was black. The nose was hugely sweet and malty with notes of chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon. The mouthfeel was incredibly thick, like pudding. It was incredibly viscous and could probably stand in as heavy-weight motor oil during the summer, in a pinch. There was also an intense heat on the tongue and I simply could not get past the combined heat and bourbon flavor. The finish continued with a lingering heat.",0.6654227261500921,4.0,0.7845

Poured from the 16 oz. can into a Tree House stemmed tulip.  a; Opaque gold with a finger thick white head which receded to thin head and spotty lacing.  s: Intense citrus/pine resin.  t; Follows the nose with some dankness, moderate hop bitterness and curiously strong initial throat burn for an 8% ABV brew. Later grapefruit notes become prominent.  m; Medium, good body and carbonation tingle.  o; A powerful-tasting DIPA which nonetheless remains light enough to be fairly easy drinking.",0.6526637261978507,4.25,0.7845
Beatification,"Look: Brilliant murky golden color.  Aroma: Sour Vinegar, earthy, lemony.  Taste: Pleasantly sour, not ripping the enamel off my teeth. Straw and fruity flavors.

Todd The Axe Man,this beer since hazy Amber gold in the glass. It hosts befool 2 inches of light beige head with a standard pour. The flavor is very unique even for an IPA. That is really saying something in today's world where everything starts to blend together. You get both juicy mango and Mandren orange in the flavor. This is a super IPA it's well worth the score.,0.6428276611467625,4.5,0.7845

Caffè Americano,"Growler into pint glass. Pours a dark dark brown with a minimal darak tan head. Initial impression is expresso, chocolate, booze, vanilla, maybe a touch of molasses, and roasted malts. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth; carbonation is minimal. Finish is oily-smooth and yet conveys a warning note of the substantial ABV.  Cigar City makes some good stuff. Their stouts have, in my experience, been consistently excellent.

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Served in a Weihenstephan lager glass. Thin, persistent head. Golden straw color.   Nose of wheat, banana, and mild clove  Taste follows, with a fantastic balance of the standard wheat beer flavors. Wheaty, but also containing smooth fruit presences.  Mouth is very refreshing.  A brewery does not operate a millennium without doing something right, and Weihenstephaner has produced platonic ideal of a wheat beer in this one.",0.7129623996035634,4.25,0.7845

Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,"Pitch black, smells like a bourbon barrel soaked fudge brownie. The deepest boldest barrel age character from Annie Jackie beer ever.

Beatification,"A - Pours a hazy golden-yellow color with a finger of frothy white head atop. The head fades down at a normal pace leaving behind some nice lacing.  S - Aroma is full of barnyard funk with sour peach and pear and other light fruits. There is also some lemon peel and other citrus flavors with some oak.  T - Starts off with lots of sourness and funk with some pear and other tart light fruits and lots of farmhouse flavors. Through the middle, some more funky flavors comes through with some Brett and other wild yeast flavors and some oak. The finish is a mix of funky wild yeast flavors with lots of farmhouse flavors, strong sourness, oak, and some lemon peel.  M - Medium bodied with moderate-plus carbonation. Feels smooth with a sour and funky finish.  D - Very drinkable. The sourness and funky flavors are so strong, but at the same time the beer feels very balanced. I really like the wild yeast flavors.",0.6900547628820958,5.0,0.7845

Enjoy By IPA,Nice head with constant bubbles rising. The smell is citrusy with definite pine and noticeable alcohol...but the overall impression is freshness.

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"A very hazy yellow / light gold pour with a white three finger head. Banana, Belgian yeast and spices on the nose - definitely a bit of clove.

Exemplary wheat beer.",0.631758500348043,4.5,0.7841
Madagascar,"I can still smell it now...super rich vanilla flavors (I'd be really disappointed if there weren't), but they lingered longer than probably any other beer I've ever had. A tiny bit thin, but that's a minor complaint. And the barrel was pretty subdued, making this extremely easy to drink for being almost 10%.",0.6606105765908926,4.75,0.7841
Society & Solitude #4,"This beer comes to me in a small snifter, a fact which I assume destroys a bit of the fluffy factor in the head. Pretty translucent golden orange color. Big aromas of tropical fruit, melon, tangerine. Its a tropical bonanza. Super fruity! Melon, tangerine, citrus, and waves of bitterness crash over my palate. Dry and medium bodied. I love these hop forward X2IPAs that aren't sticky or cloying. Sometimes I find X2IPAs can lean to far towards barleywine or strong ale. This one rocks.",0.6816814361957826,5.0,0.784

Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"A: Poured from the can into a Duvel tulip. Body is hazy ambery-honey in color with a small off-white head on top.  S: Big nose jumps out of the glass - tropical fruity pineapple, citrus peel, lime juice and an earthiness that at times reminds me of green onions.  T: Juicy. Bitterness coats the roof of the mouth after each sip. Lime juice and pineapples and grapefruit juice are all noted, as is a more tannic, woodsy bitterness.   M: This one is so juicy that it's nearly pulpy. Hard to measure its heft - call it medium to full in body, carbonation is not really noted, but it's there as a fine prickly type of carbonation.   O: Very good. I feel the hops profile could be better, or better suited to my palate, but YMMV.",0.6700796354529959,4.25,0.784
Scaled Up,"Pours orange, unfiltered and hazy with a two finger head. Smells of spicy hops and citrus. Flavor is sweet and bitter, hoppy and smooth. Quite smooth. Spiciness and hoppiness stand out the most here. Citrus still present, but dominated by the rest of the flavors. Alcohol is well hidden. Overall, really nice - but their more citrus-forward IPA's I personally prefer.",0.7010334565377124,4.25,0.7839
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Had this on tap at DLD 09.   Pitch black, motor oil, no highlights, and a thin but fluffy dark tan head that holds for a little bit and leaves some lacing that coats the side of the glass. Aroma is quite impressive, dark fruits abounding, molasses, coffee but not too much coffee, chocolate, bread and alcohol. Oakiness and vanilla, perhaps some extra heat as compared to the regular version.  It is a very thick, oily beer as expected, complex, with coffee, bittersweet chocolate, sweet caramel, molasses, fruits, vanilla but some noticeable heat, brandy like, which does not blend perfectly.  This is an incredible beer, but IMHO, one step down from regular DL. The oak aging did not match perfectly. Still a fantastic beer.",0.6715938975023735,4.5,0.7836
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Pours a jet black with a thin deep brown foam head. Nose is of wet coffee grounds, molasses and burnt malt. Taste is extreamly coffee forward. Dark roast black, no cream no sugar. Nice sweet bourbon kick that cuts through the coffee. Wood, toasted dark malts, light vanilla and caramel present. A little thin on body, watered down. Still tho a very good stout. If you like your coffee dark. You'll dig this.",0.616774199228436,4.5,0.7828
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Big, dark, and delicious - this stands on the shoulders of the regular DL (which I have always found to be a bit of a letdown).

Appearance- a hazy gold with an intense storm of carbonation bubbles that builds and sustains a thick, fluffy pillow of white head. Lacing is foamy and sticky! Beautiful in the tulip! Smell - mouth watering mango, pineapple and juicy fruit gum! Taste - wonderful assortment of tropical and stone fruit with the flavorful juicy fruit gum blended in nicely with a tinge of alcohol! Feel - a rush of fruity flavors, appropriately aggressive bitterness, with just the right touch of booze! Overall - its reputation precedes it, great beer; pricey, but you get what you pay for!",0.6803303975602552,4.5,0.7825
Nelson,"Amazing beer, my all time favorite.   So cloudy and sweet, like citrus dew drops landing on your tongue after a tropical rainstorm. Life changing.   Near, if not perfect beer. Near, rather than perfect due to inconsistency and availability. Try it at the brewery a few times and you’ll see what I mean about consistency.

Sang Noir,"Pours dark grape colored with minimal head. Smells of cherry juice, sour and some funk. Taste follows the nose, but sweet, fruity, dry, plenty of a sour pucker. Not really getting much of the whiskey at all. Still, really enjoyable sour. Would drink it again, but man this might be the most expensive beer I've ever bought.

Haze,"L: Hazy Amber. Lacing is absolutely gorgeous S: Orange, peach smell with slight dank/earthy notes.  T: It has that burst of juicy fruit goodness on the tongue, as if you were to bite into a pineapple or peach. It's almost acidic initially. Like sharp juice bomb. It's followed by a balanced bitter finish. Bit piny and like rinds from fruits F: It's silky smooth. Medium-full mouth feel for an IPA. Reminds me of Central Water Cassian Sunset mouth feel. Silky.

Sang Noir,"Red brown and pink pour. Thin off white head. Aroma was dark cherry, red wine, less bourbon than a comparable beer of theirs, vlad the impaler.  Taste leans more towards their fruitier beers. More sour and fruit than bourbon and oak. Its still there, its a complex beer even though Cascade's sours have all had that similar lacto clean sour profile. This is a real good beer and one of the best in the Cascade profile, if you liked vlad but want it less boozy and more fruity and sour, this is your jam.",0.6386232501195328,4.5,0.775
Flora,"Backlog from Quintessence 2018  Pours a clouded lighter yellow with almost no head at all.  Smells of faint grass, orange zest, moldy wood and a slighty acidic sourness.  Has a very refreshing, lighter mouthfeel, balanced by a vivid, sparkling carbonation.  Tastes of sour lemons, mellowing oak and a lighter funkiness from first glance, unreveling a very prominent sourness. Among old leather and more oak the funkiness gets pushed back a little by stale, sweeter malts, adding to the complexity of the tartness in this. Finishes calmer, with almost nothing prevailing but a long going sourness, producing a stonger acetic nuance.  Quite nice for what it is, with its complexity not being in the same ballpark as any of the available Belgian beer‘s at the event of comparable style.",0.6982633276077373,3.5,0.7739

Poured into a a DFH wheat beer glass, 2 fingers of foam, opaque rusted gold color, good lacing. Slight carbo. Almost to drinkable. What else can I say?",0.5973386580773778,4.75,0.7717
Swish,"Opaque solid yellow with a moderate foamy white head leaving a little spotty lace.  Smell is pretty dank cannabis, almost to a rubbery plastic level, with pine resin, white pepper, creamy oats, pear, green mango, and guava.  Taste is grassy earthy weed, slightly spicy pine, creamy oats, grapefruit, mango, and pineapple. Swish is not quite as fruity as I expected, as some of their other IPAs really explode with tropical and Asian fruits. I'm surprised due to the status of this one compared to Reciprocal, Substance and Diavoletto. I guess, though, this makes this a more classic, yet explosive fresh, IPA than some of their other brews, which in a way explains its appeal.  Bittersweet, soft, thick to almost chewy, finishing semi-dry.",0.6732202748164255,4.25,0.7717
Black Tuesday,I've had this more times than I can count and it's consistently the best BA imperial stout out there. You'd be hard pressed to find a beer that hides the 18%-19% better than Black Tuesday.,0.5394285687457625,5.0,0.7717
Haze,Great Beer. Dangerous. Ive never had a beer that was so drinkable at 8.2 % I finished this beer in a heartbeat. Felt more like a session IPA. In a good way.,0.5668931575416641,4.75,0.7713
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Just to get some chatter going on this, the wine barrel comes out incredibly complimentary and softens the mouthfeel. Base Dorothy prevails but with a more delicate rounded presence and then a bright mango wine oak complexity evolves. Greatly exceeded my expectations of what barrel time could do to Dorothy.",0.6852003391813749,4.5,0.7708
Haze,"woahhh this one had way more dankness than any of the other TH beers ive tried! up front there is some juicy orange and a hint of stone fruits, definitely getting that peppery spice and some bitterness reminiscent of grapefruit peel and pine needles on the finish ... everything is pretty mellow and blends together except this massive dankness throughout. mouthfeel is on point. overall very enjoyable and quite different than most TH to my taste.",0.6864426795084153,4.5,0.7707
Caffè Americano,"22oz bottle, no apparent freshness date. 3,000th beer! Very dark brown body capped with a foamy brown head. Coffee, vanilla, and chocolate aroma with some roast and earthy hops in the background; booze is present. Intense flavors dance on the palate: cocoa, coffee, vanilla, caramel, roasted, peppery booze, earthy hops. Thick and creamy body, lower carbonation, alcohol is warming. Perfect beer for a milestone! This was fantastic!",0.6513518196700689,4.5,0.7701
Oude Geuze Vintage,375ml bottle consumed at the Bruges Beertje on 4/23/10.  From Notes....  Appearance: Pours a slightly hazed orange to almost red with a 1 finger white crown that displays moderate retention and lace.  Smell: Moderate urine soaked hay note.  Taste: Same as nose but a little more straight forward.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with good carbonation.  Drinkability: Makes you want more with each sip due to the slighty dryness.,0.6371881241555719,4.5,0.7699
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Outstanding Hefe. Straw collected. Mid carbonation. Light banana smell. Faint fruit. Mild spiced after taste, balanced though. Everything worked together very very well.",0.6798039629258211,4.25,0.7698
Green,"Appearance - Poured from a growler, a very light but hazy straw color. Perfect juicy color.  Smell - Powerful pineapple and hop aroma. Funky, but in a good way.  Taste - Funky pineapple with a hint of bubblegum. Just enough bitterness to match the sweet juicy flavor.   Feel - Smooth texture with a bitterness that hangs on to the back of your tongue.   Overall - A juice bomb with a smooth finish that leaves you wanting more. This is everything a hop head can desire out of a juicy NE style IPA",0.6762444752156131,4.75,0.7698
Enjoy By IPA,"For freshness sakes, not much out there on the shelves will be as fresh as this exquisite citrus and floral double IPA. Defying the laws of retail beer distribution, the Stone Brewing Company delivers this release with a label displaying an enjoy by date not far from when some lowly clerkboy stocked the beer. Now, I'm not sure why anyone would buy a case of 4 6-packs and not be able to drink all of it in one night but for such plebians it is probably recommended you stick to more layperson varieties such as Coronas which, from personal experience, can be drunk a good five years from purchase date (a single bottle half-drunk was found behind my fridge after cleaning out my condo and still tasted fine). However, if you're into a fresh boozy beer with a flavor of manufacturing plant still in the bottle you have the King right here.",0.6062171180634343,4.0,0.7697

The beer has a slightly musty smell as well with a little bit of pepper.  T: Follows the nose exceptionally well with lots of peach and honeydew with an earthy dank spicy finish almost makes you think it might have rye in it. Slight sweetness and very little bitterness almost no malts to speak of.   M: Creamy but not very heavy beer it is very smooth and alcohol is almost non existent.  O: Another absolutely dynamite IPA from Trillium. This beer is one you do not ever want to pass up. Its juicy and dank and earthy all in one very dynamic layered DIPA that the flavors really pop on.",0.6647103792119274,4.75,0.7691
Beatification,"l bottle poured into a Russian River Belgian stemmed glass  A: Pours a hazy orange with no head, not seeing much carbonation, no lacing, no head retention, looks like hazy orange juice.   A: Sour vinegar, hints of lemon zest, tart, oak tannins, no alcohol on the nose, smells pretty solid.  T: Punch of vinegar sour and tartness up front, hint of lemon peel zest, oak from the barrel, finish is dry with more lemon and citrus notes reemerging, very balanced, ver drinkable.  M: Light bodied with a crisp dry finish, good amount of carbonation.  O: Very impressed, very balanced, not overly tart or sour, has a nice touch of lemon and citrus zest, some oak in the finish, a world class beer.",0.6700645325463029,4.5,0.7691
Sang Noir,"A: Pours a deep, dark red with a fingers worth of head that sticks around for a while  S: Lots of cherry and oak up front, with hints of the bourbon and vinous wine notes. Some lighter tart notes. Very lightly sweet as well, most likely from the vanilla notes from the bourbon barrels  T: Starts off with some moderate tart notes that are held in check by the firm oaky notes and sweet cherries. Some bourbon, vanilla, and grape notes pop up shortly after the tartness. Tannins and vinous notes show up next, followed by moderate alcoholic esters. Finishes with lingering tartness and oak notes  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation  O: An extremely complex and intricate beer that really touches on all aspects. Cherries, bourbon, vinous wine notes, and oak really all stand out and show off in their own ways. This is a beer you need to check out, even with the price tag, especially if you're into sours",0.6684699868369045,4.5,0.7687
Scaled Up,"Pounder Can > Snifter  A - Hazy orange gold with a finger of thin fizzy white head, no lacing.

T - Big bold hop profile here, earthy and spicy hop resin, big citrus bite with some juicy tropical note in the background, very light malt base, big bitterness that isnt over the top.

Swish,"Been a couple years since I last tried Swish, it was too astringent then, but it tastes damn close to perfect now. Starting from the back, there's a balanced citrus bitter finish. Moderate dankness and a hint of savory vegetable with the juicy fruit punch. The aroma is more floral, but still backed by big fruity hops. Lots and lots of delicious, well balanced hops.",0.7155942607700367,4.5,0.7684
Second Fiddle,Overall a great west coast meets east coast. Mostly translucent with the slightest haze. Clean and crisp. Tinge of fruit but mostly piney. This tasted like a slightly toned down version of Maine Dinner to me.,0.6513744840523474,4.75,0.7684
Space Trace,"Appearance: Pours ebony colored with a tan head that quickly fades; minimal lacing but you do get some coconut floaties  Smell: Chocolate, coconut oak and Bourbon  Taste: Huge flavors with the chocolate and coconut bursting; Bourbon barrel elements build, through the middle, slong with a rich oak and nutty flavor  Mouthfeel: Full bodied and creamy; low to moderate carbonation  Overall: Only the second beer I have tried from Bottle Logic; this one makes me want to seek out Fundamental Observation",0.6868221417494087,4.25,0.7684
Madagascar,Pours black from the bottle. Has a lot of vanilla in the nose but it seems to be one dimensional lacking barrel characteristics. The body is again full of vanilla with very subtle bourbon and oak. A bit unbalanced in my opinion. The feel is great though with a light silky mouth feel. Underwhelmed from the hype.,0.6831906775989971,4.0,0.7684
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Pours a clear, red/pink color. 1/4 inch head of a pink color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of strong raspberries, tart yeast, slight dark citrus, sour notes, and slight earthiness. Fits the style of a Lambic - Fruit. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with a low carbonation level. There is also a noticeable bitterness. Tastes of raspberries, tartness, pungent sour flavors, and also a strong tang. I had a hard time discerning what ingredients caused the basic flavors I tasted, but nonetheless it was an amazing brew.",0.7068112060945162,4.0,0.7684
Sip Of Sunshine,"Thanks to Ian (and Will by proxy) for the trade. Pours a light amber with slightly less haziness than other top NEDIPA's. Nose is juicy citrus fruits but not too strong. Taste - man oh man. Outstanding. Not a hint of the high abv. Nice bitterness on the front end and elements of papaya, citrus rind, peach follows. Smooth finish. Mouthfeel not as silky smooth as Treehouse or Trillium, but I think I prefer it that way in the summer. Refreshing. In my opinion, this is a top ten DIPA, right up there with HT and Julius. Will be making the run to Vt.",0.6855755138338028,4.75,0.7682
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"I had a few of these at the Dark Lord event on Saturday. Pretty fantastic beer - very sweet and heavy on the bourbon. In general, I believe that 3-Floyds is over-hyped because of their awesome marketing and limited production/distribution, but I think this one has earned it's grade.",0.5598950424537134,4.75,0.7681

Green,"A nice departure from the overly juicy beers one expects from TH. It is more complex and bitter than most of their offerings, save Sap, and it is delicious because of that.",0.6829438279090774,4.75,0.7675

Black Tuesday,"2013 bottle (quick notes)  Appearance - Black, with a ruby hue around edges. Little to no head. There is no lacing, rather legs, like wine. It looks intimidating almost.   Aroma - Raisin, bourbon (vanilla and burnt oak), prunes, and a touch of chocolate.   Taste - Chocolate, anise, raisin, prune, vanilla, oak, bourbon. The flavors all are there separately, and distinguishable.   Mouthfeel - Burn! Sweet, smooth burn!  Overall - This guy's HUGE! It's complex as hell, but intriguing all the way through. This was fresh as of a month or so. I think it needs at least a full year or two to mellow and mature.",0.6663786448222825,4.75,0.7664
Oude Geuze Vintage,"This was the 2003 vintage, I did a side by side tonight with a 2010 modern drie fonteinen geuze.  It looks basically exactly the same as the modern one, actually the vintage has a better head though.  The taste & smell of the new one are both what I would describe as 'sharper', more apple tartness, the vintage has more of a sugary oaky smell profile with some subtle apple tartness.  The mouthfeel on the vintage is amazing, it makes the modern one seem like water. Its got a long lingering tartness. So funky, lots of barrel, just covers the mouth, greatness.  Overall, they are both good beers, glad I got to do a side by side, its not 'radically' different than the modern, so don't expect that, but there is a notable difference.",0.6807148820014104,4.5,0.7661
Dragonsaddle,"This. Beer. Kills. So clean. Hop presence is undeniable in such a big boy. Tangy, juicy, drinks like a 8/9% iipa, but with more punch. This shit just rules. As far as triple ipa's go, of which I've only had a few (all green everything, hi-res, triple simtra) it wins. Nothing else to say bc triple ipa's are a limited category and I haven't had PTY, so have nothing that conquers to compare it to. I just think it's awesome though. Get it if you can. It won't disappoint",0.5429604970014342,4.5,0.7659
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2007 bottle. Clear bright red, medium head. Nose is tightly woven brett, fresh raspberries. Very juicy as with most Cantillon fruit lambics. Mouth is very tight, refined, juicy raspberries, acidity, and barnyard brett. Acidity is mostly on the front end and not on the finish. The high acidity makes this much less attractive than the Lou Pepe Kriek from the same year. I'm thinking it's just really difficult to make a raspberry lambic or raspberry sour without it being acidic over a couple years.",0.6700427445371391,4.0,0.7659
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),Solid stout here. Nice head and lace. The base beer is good enough. I don't get a great deal of smooth barrel here. Has a little bite.

Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,Pours black with small brown head. Smells of typical BA stout. Tastes like a little bigger Dark Apparition...don't really know what else to say other than I'm glad they scammed the public into thinking this was even remotely close to DERIVATION. Bummed I traded a good beer for this :-/,0.5502964388212002,3.5,0.765
Sang Noir,"2013  Pour dark brown, darker then expected, with a thick kahiki head. Aromas sweet red, rich black and sour tart cherries in the nose. Mild caramel oak and bourbon aroma in the nose.

Haze,Hazy as advertised. Thin dissipating head. Pine and mango on the nose. Overripe mango and waves of bitter resin collide here and settle into a strong pithy afterglow. Palate buster for sure. Awesome Tree House offering.,0.6507840677398419,4.75,0.765
Society & Solitude #4,"Solid double IPA. A bit bitter on the aftertaste for my own personal liking, but the taste is unique given the hop mix and profile. Overall beautiful color.",0.6902061982331225,4.25,0.765
Juicy,"Served to me and split at hill farmstead brewery, batch two.  Pours a clear Amber body with a small white head that reduces slowly to leave some retention and spotty lacing.  Aromas are funky and oaky, wet oak, musty basement, white wine, tart citrus, grapefruit zest.

Sure Bet,"22oz  L- Pours a deep, opaque orange.  S- Like an over ripe orange punch to the face.  T- As expected. Big time citrus. Orange, grapefruit. Big bitter hops up front and throughout. Decent malt backbone though makes it bearable. Still a bit of a sipper.  F- Moderate carb. Noticeable alcohol, combined with the massive hops, make it somewhat difficult getting through the bottle.

Black Tuesday,Probably the best beer I've ever had. Drank the 2013 vintage in August 2015 around a bonfire...poured black as night and smelled incredibly complex. Can't imagine how they make a 19% ABV beer this drinkable but the Bruery succeeded!,0.5784374320930643,5.0,0.7644

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Not Shure why some ratings are low. This bottle was from a trade as an extra and stayed in the stash for a while so it has been aged. Definitely not the""hot mess"" I have seen some reviewers describe.  Look dark and minimal head  Smell cinnamon, chocolate, barrel, pepper.  Taste if you don't like hot peppers you will not like this. Spicy with chocolate, cinnamon, hot peppers and a touch of caramel.  Feel nice medium thick  Overall I would definitely do this again. Great BA stout with some spice. Very close to BA Bomb.",0.6191439797983035,4.5,0.7643
Green,"Pours a uniformly very cloudy straw/orange colour with a medium tall head which fades fairly quickly down to just a light covering which remains while drinking. Some light lacing remains in thin sheets. Aroma upon opening is of grapefruit and other juicy citrus (orange, passionfruit). Taste is very juice forward - grapefruit, orange, pineapple, perhaps others, with the addition of a light grassiness before fading into a sweet juicy mild bitterness which lingers after each sip. Mouthfeel is smooth and fairly full with a light tingling from carbonation. This is my first beer from Tree House & it is very nice. As GTAer, it immediately reminds me of Bellwoods IPAs with their classic juice-like qualities. I was able to trade for this with Steve - thanks Steve - some day during my annual drives out East I will make it to Tree House!",0.6855606566933486,4.5,0.7639

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Draught, Dark Lord Day 2008. Original Dark Lord is a 5.0 beer for me, a 1 year barrel aged version just takes it to another level.

One of the best beverages I've consumed.",0.6072857413899949,5.0,0.7579

Haze,"Bought a 750 ML growler on Thursday 9/29. Appearance includes a very murky yellow orange with a thick, bubbly head with thick lacing on the sides. Aromas are very apparent with grapefruit, tangerine, and orangepeel smells. Taste follows the nose with an incredibly fruity (citrus mostly) flavor, including a sharp orange aftertaste. The mouthfeel really helps to bring out the flavors by making this beer have a medium carbonation while being very refreshing. Overall, this was a fantastic beer, especially with its aromas.",0.6907488668775779,4.5,0.7574

Blanc De Blancs,"A wonderful aroma on this one of big lemony tart qualities, almost a plastic funk.   The flavor however is slightly overwhelming of lemony tart, which has been a problem Fuzzy as well. Despite that, a good complexity of tart with some yogurt tart qualities as well. White grapes up front on the finish.   Very surprised that the ABV is so darn high for what it drinks like. However, generally covered by too much tart qualities and I much preferred JK's Blanc du Bois in a side by side.",0.6856099469788617,4.0,0.757
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Jet black with minimal head and a shiny oily luster. The nose and taste is big coffee upfront and settles into more of a Maple and Bourbon focus as it warms, however all three of the Coffee, Maple, and Bourbon remain throughout and interact well as it warms. The mouthfeel is an absolute 5 from the chilly beginning though the warm finish, with smooth sticky oil-like viscosity. Easily meets the hype, never had better!",0.6755044620135621,5.0,0.7569
Green,"Wonderful NE style IPA pours a beautiful hazy gold color. The aroma on this thing jumped out of the glass, so much citrus and tropical flavors, mango, pineapple, a little less bitterness than Julius, but enough that it’s balanced. Mouthfeel is like a freakin pillow and the finish is crisp and juicy. This exceeded expectations.",0.7062895770826675,4.75,0.7569
Space Trace,"Pours dark black with quickly dissipating head. The aroma is bourbon, chocolate and oak. I'm not getting a ton of coconut, it's over powered by the chocolate. Huge chocolate flavors with a strong bourbon punch, the coconut is there, but it doesn't really come into play until the finish. The mouthfeel isn't as thick as I'd like and it's a bit over carbonated. Overall, it's very good, but I don't think it's worth what it pulls in a trade. Wait for bottle logics hype to die down before seeking this out.",0.6351935577728053,4.25,0.7569

Very GGGreennn,"Pours a completely opaque vibrant gold. The nose is full on pineapple and honeydew with a bubblegum garnish. The taste follows, but the honeydew is punched up to the 10th degree.

Sang Noir,"An 8 oz pour at the Cascade Barrel house on 8/19/2014. As close to perfect as possible. It starts brown with a copious head, producing a good amount of lace. Aroma: sour fruit and oak, very Flemish red. Nicely complex flavor: cherries, prunes, oak, bourbon. Dry with a light to medium light body and low carbonation. Lower acidity and more dried fruit than the usual Flanders red. A must have.",0.7034393301299439,4.5,0.7553

Nelson,"Very unique Rye IPA that is now one of my new favorites! Pours a hazy golden/orange into a pint glass with a decent head and slight lacing retention as you drink this West Coast brew. The smell of this brew reminds me a Belgian style beer on the nose, but as you take a sip you quickly realize it's anything but a Belgian. This IPA style brew is packed with Nelson hops and is really an interesting and unique style and flavor profile as it's different than any other IPA type of beer I've tasted. Rye and Nelson hops are used in brewing and dry hopping double time!",0.610256760029099,3.75,0.7544

Pours a cloudy orange/almost red, juice colour, medium off white head forms, quickly settles to a very thin ring around the glass, no real lacing, nice colour.  Smell is nice, big Cantillon sourness and funk, raspberries, wood, earthy, barnyard, vinegar, still a solid amount of fruity sweetness, lots of lemon and acidity, nice funkiness, smell is great.  Taste is badass, wickedly sour and tart, vinegar, oak/wood, barnyardy funk, lemons, some raspberry sweetness and a bit of fruit through the middle, earthy, wicked almost salty, but very acidic in the finish.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, feels a bit thicker than most Cantillon, but this one is wickedly tart. Great stuff.",0.6767114187834772,4.0,0.7543
Sang Noir,"A - Deep, dark, ruddy brown. Almost Rodenbach Grand Cru territory but not quite. Pink cream head.  S - Definite sweet bourbon on the nose.  T - Bourbon nips the palate. Bourbon, cherry and port are the main takeaways.  M - Dry. Letting the beer wash around the mouth provokes pucker.  O - I didn't particuarly like the flavours in this beer, but I did find it interesting so I gave it a higher overall score",0.6203798831395183,4.0,0.754
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Poured an opaque black color with a small, quickly diminishing, dark tan head that left sticky tan lacing on the glass. Aroma of bourbon, roasted malts, chocolate, smoke, nuts, and dried fruits. Taste of sweet chocolate, roasted malts, mocha, maple syrup. brown sugar, smoke, bourbon, with a fair amount of alcohol coming across. A Dark Lord mouthfeel should be a little more vicious, but either way, it's a pretty solid beer... I still prefer the cask of regular DL I had at the Maproom in 04.",0.6191133243549335,4.5,0.7538
Nelson,"Bottle into a snifter. Hazy golden in appearance with moderate translusence. Big ol' pillow head of white foam on top. Looks nice. Big aroma of hop resin, citrus, grapefruit, orange peel, lemon zest, and a touch of rye spice. The taste is very citrus and rye/malt forward. A very nice hop bitterness creeps in middleways and takes the wheel, leaving this beer to finish like a true West Coast IPA. The feel is very, very smooth and creamy, possibly the smoothest IPA I've ever had.   This is very good. I've passed this up on the shelf before because of the price, but it's worth it once in a while.",0.6585885355775061,4.5,0.7517
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"Pours black with a large, tan head that rapidly fades away into nothing. No lacing.  Oaky, milky, with extremely strong, harsh bourbon notes on the nose. Unlike other maple brews I've had, the maple is actually more apparent and nutty when fresh, as opposed to after aging at length where it fades here--in other dark brews featuring maple, it seems to take over with time.  The flavor of this beer is like a full glass of whiskey with a shot of light porter in it. Unfortunately, that's it. I detect no maple whatsoever. After having recently had Project PAM, I find that astounding, since Black Maple is described as actually having syrup added to the brew, but Project PAM is only aged in maple barrels without added syrup, and has far more maple to it. I think a lot of people either read maple on the label and feel obligated to say it's there after going through all the trouble it takes to get this, or they're subliminally duped into thinking it's there. It's not. Either way, once it fully warms after sitting for far too long, there are faint nutty notes in the background, but it's still aggressively dominated by bourbon. Again, when freshest, it is better, and a little more balanced, with a woodier flavor.  Not unlike drinking a strong cocktail or straight bourbon, boozy heat flows up through the nose, with a mild burn that rubs the back of the throat. The mouthfeel is a fizzy, tangy sting on the tongue, and the beer itself is actually quite thin for me. As it warms, at its freshest, it becomes slick and sticky.  I'm very disappointed in this beer considering the enormous reputation it has earned. When I have a beer, I don't want a cocktail, I want the beer to shine through first and foremost. There are far better barrel aged brews out there offering a more balanced take on the style.",0.6679270587929035,2.0,0.7517

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Had myself a glass of this at DLD 2007. Was really looking forward to it!  Pours a deep opaque black, no light escapes, thin tan head, some lace spots, very oily. Smell is powerful, sweet, lots of cherries, and chocolate, oaky vanilla, alcohol, and oranges. Taste is similar, strong oaky vanilla, caramel, chocolate, roasty goodness, more tangerine/orange and alcohol. Mouthfeel is full bodied with low carbonation.

Taste: The hops work very well with the rye to give it a unique rye and tropical flavor. In addition the flavors are highlighted by some citrus and grapefruit.   Feel: It has a moderate body with a moderately high bitterness. The bitterness is high enough to provide a good bite, without being overpowering.

S: The nose is full of tart unripe raspberries mixed with sweet raspberry preserves all blended with a crazy funky blast of sweaty socks.  T: Tastes like raspberry Warheads candy (malic and ascorbic acids mostly). I get almost no vinegar burn. The raspberry is almost overpowered by the sour, but it’s still sweet and flavorful, and the sweaty funk is there is full force. M: Ultra dry and chalky with very low carbonation and a medium body.

Flora,"This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a hazy burnt yellow to orange color with a one finger white foamy head that quickly dissipated leaving some light messy lacing sliding right on into the beer. The smell takes on a quick sour grape to bitter grapefruit and then a subtle grapefruit, semi-sweet grassy contour. Beautifully floral and then a lemony sweet to bitter aroma. The taste takes on the same aroma roaming into a florally bittersweet dry aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation runs fairly light allowing the sourness to hit as a good penetrator for the harshness. Overall, this isn't a saison but a really nice American Wild ale.",0.6972530910870988,4.0,0.7498

A touch of floral hops in here as well with a hint of residual earthy bitterness   M: medium mouthfeel with low carbonation. Not quite as fluffy as I would have imagined, but that’s ok - this is a Pale Ale  O: pretty decent offering. Sweet, but just enough bitterness to make this slightly refreshing, which a Pale Ale should be to me. Not mind-blowing, but something that isn’t offensive either",0.6532367429325213,4.0,0.7494

Coconut B-Bomb,"Dark brown with a tall dense tan foam that settles very slowly to a persistent blanket leaving random worms of lace.  Smell is nutty wet oak paired with some dark chocolate roasted malt and a splash of peppery bourbon. It easily smells like a whiskey dunked milk chocolate Almond Joy.  Toasted coconut and roasted malt collide to give a peanutty flavor with some toasty wafer. The barrel provides some rum-like heat but also enhances the peanut-like coconut with a mild woodiness. As it warms, luscious caramel comes out bringing this into samoa territory.  The slick, medium body has a mild carbonation before a tingly, slightly boozy and semi-dry swallow.  2017 bottle",0.6454536472669781,4.25,0.7469

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,Very big and very balanced. Quite hot.  I've now had 3 of these over the last week and everytime I just love it more. Never before have I been so enamored by roast in a stout. Typically I'm a sucker for the sweet dark fruit and am put off by bitter roast.  This beer is roasty centered through and through but never comes across as bitter. I liken it somewhat to ba ten fidy with less bourbon presence and more overall balance. The mouthfeel is just world class as well.  God I hope I can find more of these.,0.6619162596670766,4.75,0.743

Boozy finish with notes of port wine on then linger   M- medium-heavy body with low carbonation leads to a slightly foamy mouthfeel and a warming boozy finish   O- definitely a simpler, loaded with chocolate and vanilla at drinks like a fine port wine or sherry",0.6125721222726179,4.5,0.743

Peche 'n Brett,"Poured a very hazy light orange with thin white head.  Bit of brett funk on the nose and lots of peaches.

Sip Of Sunshine,"Look is a near hazy amber with off white head.   Smell is sticky hops, orange and maybe even some papya-ish going on.  Taste is grapefruit rind, orange and some other fruits I can't quite pick out.  Feel is hard to describe. It feels good.  Overall it's on the same level as Heady Topper. I suppose it would depend on my mood as to which was rated better. It's definately worth seeking out.",0.6312945899524688,4.75,0.743

Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Best part of this beer is the aroma. I get Lots of chocolate with some roasted coffee along with big bourbon notes including vanilla, toffee, and toasted coconut. Mouth feel is medium and carbonation is aggressive, but overly so. Most Jackie Os beers are too boozy for me so the taste doesn't quite follow the world class aroma.

T - Sweet, bourbon, dark cherry, coffee, dark chocolate and dark roasted malts.  M - Holy crap. Thickest beer I have ever put in my mouth. Like heavy whipping cream the color or the standard used motor oil. Chewy as hell.  D - Just a complete palate trashing beer. This is for sipping and only one (if you could get much of this anyway!).   Overall, amazing beer though I still prefer standard DL and Darkness better.",0.6280713380784115,4.0,0.7424

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"2017 release.  A: Pours essentially black with a cap of dense, espresso-like tan head. Very persistent ring of foam.  S: Rich dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, cinnamon stick, and walnuts (which I think is the source of a cardboard-like impression). Mild alcohol burn.  T: Leans more towards non-BA RIS with dark chocolate, ground cinnamon, light cola and roast, mild oak and vanilla, and a mild pepper and alcohol heat that comes through at the end. Light bourbon comes through as the beer reaches room temp. Medium-light sweetness ties together the flavors.  M: Medium-light body, a touch thin for the style, with medium-high carbonation.   O: Pretty tasty, bringing together a lot of disparate flavors. A fairly light barrel treatment and a slight cardboard aroma (though not taste) which dominates at colder temps.",0.6725490459179909,4.25,0.742
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"16oz. can served in a Spiegelau IPA glass. Canned 8/23/16 (DANGER ZONE) printed on the botton. Pours a hazy burnt orange with a loose, half inch, cream-colored head that settles into a soapy froth. Amazing nose! Guava, citrus and pith. Taste is more pithy and dank than tropical fruit with some resinous qualities that linger between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a prickly carbonation, light acidity and a residual burn at the finish. Another awesome IPA from the crew at Trillium. The nose is incredible!",0.6636060211233559,4.25,0.7418
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Poured from a capped 750ml bottle dated 3/9/16 into a Teku glass:  Trillium cannot go wrong with their double dry hopped beers.

Society & Solitude #4,"Poured from a 750 mL growler into an enlarged snifter. This was filled at the brewery a week ago today.  A: Pours a very hazy apricot and leaves a fluffy couple fingers of white head which take a while to fade, leaving some white atop the beer. (4.5)  S: Juicy citrus, tropical fruits, some floral hops, a touch of spruce, and some creamsicle. Full of delicious fruit flavors, no off flavors at all. (4.75)  T: Big grapefruit, pineapple, apricots, a bit of spruce, some grassy/earthy notes. Very drinkable, full of hoppy deliciousness. (4.75)  M: Medium, slightly creamy body, medium carb with some juiciness in the body. (4.5)  O: A really well done, aggressively hoppy (especially citrus and tropical) IPA that is very drinkable.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Note: This review is based on the '13 vintage.  L: Dark motor oil that clings to the glass. S: Tons of maple up front with a tiny bit of coffee. T: Balanced and maple forward.  F: Nice and thick. Coats your mouth and lingers. Just like Assassin, the mouth feel is perfect! O: I'm glad I was first able to try this beer shortly after it was released before it became impossible to acquire. It's excellent but nowhere near the amount of money or beer traded to acquire one.",0.5923841754505785,4.75,0.7398
Black Tuesday,"Pours out dark as night with a two finger, beige head with decent retension and little lacing.   Smell is dark malts, lots of chocolate, and a little tiny bit of booze that hard to notice.  Taste is tons of dark malts, tons of chocolate like no other beer I have tasted, definitely a little heat but nothing that I don't like as I love to drink bourbon clean so this is nothing.  Mouthfeel is huge. Really thick. Maybe the thickest beer I have ever had.   Overall this is a great beer that I have never had and definitely would love to drink again.",0.6095783163373785,4.5,0.7394

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2011 sticker - 2014 cork Poured a very nice burgundy color with minimal amount of head.  Nose was that typical Cantillion funk with a ton of fresh tart raspberries.  Flavor followed the nose.  Prickly, tart mouthfeel, but not mouth puckering.  Enjoyed the LPF a lot more than the LPK.

Coolship Red,"2014 Vintage, so has a little bit over a year on it A: I wish I could post a picture of this beer. It's red, hazy with a little head that dissipates quickly. Streams of tiny bubbles just streaming up the sides of the glass. S: Funky raspberry, basement, rotten hay, and oak. Everything you want out of a sour. T: Starts with a sweet raspberry, flowing into this sour bite, going into the end with a little more sweet raspberry and oaky dryness to clean the palate. M: It's moderate with some stingy carb that helps with the clean finish of this beer. O: A beer I've wanted to try so badly and I'm not disappointed at all. These beer is so well balanced. This is so reminiscent of LPF.",0.6481667774048006,4.75,0.7382
Darkstar November,"500ml bottle, 2016 release. Served in a snifter glass. Pours a dark oily black body, slight brownish hue, one finger thick mocha head, good retention. No lacing. Smells of deep dark chocolate, fudge, a bit of spice, sweet milk chocolate, brown sugar, touch of spice, oak, even a little bit of light smoke. Wonderful. Flavour follows; massive chocolate fudge, brown sugar, molasses, milk chocolate, fair bit of bourbon as well. So flavourful, a little bit boozy but the flavours seem to overcome that for me. Mouthfeel is a massive thick and full bodied beer, good carbonation, slick yet not sticky, almost perfect mouthfeel. Another great Bottle Logic stout, these guys are really killing it nowadays.",0.6505820409914314,4.5,0.7382
Juicy,"Served in a Sweetwater mini-snifter.  Memories of The PJs doesn't help my initial perception of this bottle... Anyway, this stuff pours a hazy amber-gold topped by a finger of cream foam. The nose comprises grapefruit peel, light mango, light leek, light-ish fruity Brett, light banana peel, and a twinge of buttery caramel. The taste holds notes of tart grapefruit zest, sour white grapes (a white wine varietal I can't pin down), light earthy greens, mandarin orange, and lemon zest. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, lightly sticky finish. Overall, a very nice beer, one that sees a keen marriage of base, extra hops, and barrel. Good times.",0.664213730743702,4.0,0.7379

Swish,"Murky, hazy, orange pineapple juice pour. Aroma and taste of pineapple, overripe guava, kiwi, ..tropical fruit mixed with acidic fruit. Doesn't have that sorbet, orange, banana, mango, non-acidic-fruit balance to smooth it out and soften it up. Mouthfeel is nice regardless with a pungent coating that ends with some green tea. Punchy hops sock you in the pie hole - imbalanced and aggressive. Looks/feels unstructured in appearance and taste. Would like more of a malt foundation with a stronger bitter finish to help mellow out the hops. As far as hop-forward IPAs go - this is it.",0.7044599612473409,4.0,0.7351
Sip Of Sunshine,"Brassy orange color with an even, refined murkiness in the glass. Very thin white head dissipates quickly to a spotty film and ring. Lacing is thick and blocky early on, sliding into wispiness on relatively short order.  Not much aroma beyond hints of wet cardboard. Mouthfeel is upfront velvety with a carbonated baking soda-like perkiness entering into the flavors. Immediate sweetness, honeyed citron and dried fruits at the onset. Apricot. Esters are noticed quickly, mainly banana and then some grapefruit. Gives way to brown and burnt sugars, leading into a mild bitterness akin to dark chocolate. Strong orange peel with a hint of nutmeg on the front of the finish lapsing back to a marshmallowy bittersweet and sodabread close that lingers on the sides and back of the tongue for a long while... ...Until the next sip starts the dreamy cycle over again.  An interesting brew full of contrasts.",0.6858261027495,4.25,0.7351

Todd The Axe Man,"Review from BeerAdvocate magazine issue #112 (MAY 2016)  Bold, Full, Bitter, Citrus Pours from the can with lovely suds and a mildly hazy appearance. Citrus rind, cattiness, cedar, black tea, ripe pears and hay in the nose. Todd The Axe Man offers ample bitterness and deep crispness with a bit of malt body. The initial balance is laid out on the palate knowing it will be somewhat decimated by a wave of hops. I love the use of the Golden Promise malt though, American IPAs need more than the usual American and/or Canadian 2-row. Citra and Mosaic, two damn tasty hops, also make themselves known. My palate surrenders to Surly, but it’s never a chore to take another sip. This one’s a real treat.

Oude Geuze Vintage,"Thanks to Mark for sharing, and to Dan for hosting :thumbup: Quick review from written notes, 2008 vintage.  Bright saturated golden orange, spotty lacing around the edges, visible carb trails rising in the glass. Foam subsided rapidly.  Mineral and sulfur traces in the nose, wet hay, lightly funky.  Sour grapefruit, lemon pith, bitter woody tannins towards the end. Clean and crisp, very smooth with a bone dry finish. Body is supple and full at the same time. Overall this was nice to try, it seems like a case of emperors new clothes, but it's a classic Drie Fonteinen gueuze all the same.  2004 vintage sampled at 3F, TDG 2019.",0.6889183723802013,4.25,0.7351

Overall: Mama's fresh cherry pie on the farm, taken in late summer over lunch in the cool shade of the barn, with the grassy aroma of a fresh hay cutting in the breeze.",0.6599126472784692,4.75,0.7351
Scaled Up,"Poured a murky orange color with a thin amount of head that dissipates quickly. Smell is dank fruit, I get peach and melon with a bit of pepper. The flavor adds citrus to the peach and melon with all that followed by some floral peppery bitter finish. This is a smooth Double IPA with a crisp finish. It's a little different than other Trillium IPA's I've had but just as good. I love the balance between ripe fruit and spicy bitterness.

Enjoy By IPA,"Bottled on 3/17/17. 22 oz. bottle poured into a be here.  An aggressive pour yielded three fingers of white foamy head that was reminiscent of a root beer float. The mostly clear, rich coppery golden pour left thick and gooey lacing whenever I tilted the glass. The nose was strong and somewhat pungent, predominantly grapefruit and pineapple with an underlying base malt aroma. The taste, again a little pungent and fruity with moderate hop bitterness. There was an ascending grapefruit  bitter sweetness (that I haven't experienced or noticed in other IPAs) that quickly faded into a bitter finish. I would call it medium bodied and smooth and I found the carbonation was just about right producing only a slight tongue bite at first. Well done! I am looking forward to the next release",0.6914592485868856,4.5,0.7345

Beatification,"Pouring from a 375 ml. bottle into a tall wine glass. Bottle dated 3/01/18. This beer pours out light straw/lemon in color. And forms a thick white crown. The smell is some fruit sweetness and tartness. Peaches, apples, pears. The taste is sharp and ripe fruit and a slight funk. Almost has a burning like tartness. I am just really not coming out impressed with these Russian Rivers I have tried. I wish I was but it's just not adding up to me. I've had better sours than this. I want more complexity, more flavor.

But it's a tad too heavy in texture and heavy in the aftertaste. Not in a sense of beiing unpleasant or anything like that, but on a sense of lacking certain quality of freshness of a wheat grain. I guess that's why it's available year round, and the old wheat definitely adds to an old starchy ending.",0.6403904347278089,4.75,0.7311

All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"Poured from a 16oz can into a Treehouse tulip glass.   Pours a deep black, inky body with a substantial frothy brown head that reduces to leave nice layered lacing.   Aromas are straight chocolate fudge and cocoa, Hershey's syrup, coffee. On the tongue it's decadent and rich but not overly filling or cloyingly sweet, very drinkable silky smooth body with milk chocolate and cocoa dominating flavor, and a coffee aftertaste.",0.6457610904366236,4.5,0.7311
Mastermind,"12oz can poured into a globe.  A: Golden-orange, the color of mango flesh. Deep haze. Fine-bubbled white head is persistent and holds at an inch in height. Webby lacing.  S: Freshly sliced mango and pineapple. Apricot. Tangerine. Leafy and dank. Doughy malt, lightly honeyed.   T: Fleshy mango and tangerine. Earthy and leafy hop flavors ride up and begin to steal the show. Spicy, peppery, and herbal. Apricot and tropical fruits assert themselves again. Green grass. Mild tartness in the background. Bitterness is firm and even. Doughy and toasty malt with a dab of raw honey. Earthy and herbal hop finish.  M: Hefty medium body. Very round and creamy. Very fine prickling carbonation adds bite. Astringencies are rather tame for the style, but there's some grittiness to it. Touch of warming alcohol.   O: Great stuff. Tame and drinkable for its size. Unfiltered and unfettered, raw, and bursting with tropical and leafy hop flavors. A quintessential 'New England' IPA, as I hear some calling this newer riff on the style. It's the sort of beer that's very en vogue with hopheads these days, and for good reason.",0.6854276533170389,4.25,0.7304

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2008 vintage, bottled in 2010  A: Super carbonated bottle with some leakage. Cork started slowly pushing out as soon as the cap was removed and could be pulled out with fingers rather than needing a corkscrew. Raised a significant head filling nearly half the glass before quickly receding. Beautiful, clear red liquid with lots of bubble activity.  S: Lots of funk and raspberry. A little jammy with a hint of parmesan cheese  T: Really sharply tart. Lots of fruit, wood, and acetic acid.  M: Highly carbonated, explodes with foam in your mouth. Long linger.  O: This beer could be great, but the over-carbonation in this bottle is really a problem, making it hard to serve and hard to taste until some extended, vigorous swirling gets most of the carbon dioxide out of solution. The smell is lovely and the taste is also very appealing once you can get to it, but the carbonation is just crazy.",0.6391907769970279,3.75,0.7292

S: Moderate aromas of bourbon are present in the nose along with hints of honey. T: The taste has lots of flavors of vanilla from the bourbon barrel aging—once it stats to warm up the bourbon also becomes prominent as well. Notes of honey are present in the finish. M: It feels full-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation. O: This imperial stout is big and bold. It tastes strong, but does a good job at masking most of the alcohol from the taste.  Note: 2016 vintage  Serving type: bottle",0.6541297692411016,4.5,0.7284

Aroma: Mexican hot chocolate, light roast, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, cinnamon, chili and wood, with maybe even some light nuttiness.  Taste: Bourbon, roasted malt, chocolate, cocoa, cinnamon, chili, raisin, coconut, vanilla, almond and oak, while a touch herbal.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, moderate to full bodied with soft carbonation.

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Poured from 12oz bottle into glass. Back label is marked 'PKG 10/16/2018'. Black colored body, with only the thinnest of back lit dark brown edge. Aggressive pour results in bubbly, light tan head, which settles back to partial cap and ring. Leaves behind a minimal pattern of small lacing spots. Aroma of dark roasted malts, and big barrel notes (bourbon, oak and vanilla). Hints of chocolate and molasses. Taste of dark roasted malts, bourbon and oak, dark chocolate, licorice, and more caramel/toffee than molasses. Toward the end there is a burst of dark fruit such as plums and dates. Has a lovely and quite long lasting after taste that slowly fades away, and invites another sip. Medium plus mouth feel. Texture is thick and slightly coating. Good carbonation is shown by the rising bubbles which create a swirling pattern at the body surface. The first part of the beer flavor is rather sweet and includes chocolate, and then the more aromatic barrel alcohol rises up and swirls into the nostrils. The toffee/caramel and dark fruit then come forth. The after taste slides away with all components participating. The higher ABV% is well hidden from alcohol burn, but the whiskey barrel is a major contributor to the smell and flavor. Lots of dark chocolate in the follow up burbs.",0.651091534428426,4.5,0.7194

The barrel is noticeable, providing undertones of oak, bourbon, vanilla and a hint of coconut, incredible  T- this tastes like a liquid nutty fudge brownie. Opens with tons of dark chocolate, brownie batter, melted caramel, black strap molasses and mocha. Mid-palate brings out the barrel character, adding undertones of woody oak and just enough bourbon to pop through. The finish is an onslaught of more brownie batter, bourbon, fudge & oak and lingers for five minutes after finishing   M- thick and viscous body with moderate carbonation leads to the thickest mouthfeel I've experiences in a beer, it's creamy, velvety and silky at the same time. The alcohol is hidden well and provides just a hint of warmth at the finish  O- I'm a skeptic when it comes to hype, but this one lived up to it.

There is a touch of honey like sweetness on the nose. The tail end of the nose has a sweet grassy like aroma.   Taste follows that aroma and is bursting with mango, orange, a hint of pineapple, peach, nectarine - lots of fruit. A touch of sweetness from the honey balances out the bitterness, although there is a hint of bitter hops on the finish.  The feel really sets this beer apart. Medium carbonation, but so smooth and light for a DIPA. It drinks and feels more like a IPA. Very crisp.

Dark fruit with some vanilla and oak on the backend. Lots going on and really well balanced. Bourbon really complements the base stout rather than overpowering it.   Mouthfeel: low carbonation, viscous, some creaminess, but not a milkshake. Pretty clean finish.   Overall: this is a really good BA Stout. Had a BCBS last night and, while this isn’t quite to that standard, it’s absolutely worth pursuing.",0.6687385209124923,4.25,0.7162
Madagascar,"Nice vanilla and barrel notes here. But the body is so damn thin for what I was expecting. Definitely a great beer, but i'm not sure I'd put it into the world class vanilla stout category...",0.620393650811341,4.25,0.7158
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,Tan head that fades to nothing. Black in color.  Nice bourbon and oak flavors. Big vanilla and chocolate. Roasted malts. Some heat. Molasses. Tastes more like an imperial stout than a porter. No maple.  Full bodied. Very smooth and warming.,0.6307455945590076,4.5,0.7146
Madagascar,"Really great vanilla flavor, but the mouth feel was not where I wanted it to be. Compared to some of the other BA vanilla stouts it was thin, but it is also lower ABV so it was to be expected. Still delicious vanilla flavor",0.6527151807278463,4.25,0.7137
Black Tuesday,"Reviewed from notes: 2013 bottle poured into a FW Teku on 7/4/14. Happy birthday America!  A: Dark black with ruby highlight when held up to the light. Not as pitch black as I expected. Small tan head recedes to nothing after about 30 seconds, per usual for a BA beer with this high of an ABV.   S: HUGE milk chocolate, caramel, and boozy bourbon notes. Hints of dark fruits and a slight alcohol burn close things out. Just a massive nose, the usual BA stout characteristics turned up to 11.  T: Syrupy sweet caramel and vanilla upfront. Pleasantly boozy bourbon and toasted raw cacao notes from the malt followed by a note of raisins. Extremely complex, but bordering on too sweet. Surprisingly limited alcohol character.  M: Thick and syrupy with low carbonation. Ridiculously mouth coating viscosity only adds to the decadence.  O: A ridiculously flavorful BA stout. Unbelievably pungent in every sensory aspect, but somehow manages to stay relatively balanced. Every bottle is a treat.",0.6878344278774751,5.0,0.7134
Vicinity,"Bright cloudy orange with a moderate, white fluffy head.  Smell is corn, wheat, lemon, orange, white grape, sea salt, and a sweet sour zip of yellow mustard.  Taste is almost like a gose, with salty lemon and wheat. Overall this is a little tart. Wow this weird for an IPA that is labeled neither as a gose or a wheat.  This beer does not feel like 8.0%. It actually feels very light and drinkable, especially due to the gose like properties. The odd, off-style attributes of this beer make it a little unnerving at first, but it's actually quite tasty.",0.6329515980665837,4.0,0.7126
Sip Of Sunshine,Pounder canned 8/22/16.  Poured from the can this isn't the best looking brew. Fairly hazy and opaque with plenty of white particles floating around. Aroma is largely pine and citrus driven. Can definitely get a sense of the abv here as it doesn't go unnoticed. That being said it is not overbearing. There is a raw hop character in the aroma as well. Finish is full of pineapple and passion fruit. A really tasty DIPA from VT and a solid brewer. It is worth noting that I scored a couple 4-packs of this and it is incredible how quickly the flavor drops off with age.,0.6980510289823578,4.25,0.7124

Sip Of Sunshine,"I get why this was groundbreaking stuff several years ago, but it just doesn't hold up to the best NE style IPAs now. Too bitter and mouthfeel is lacking.

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"I had this on tap at DLD.  Black as sin with tan rays of hope coating the sides of the cup. Thick, oily, and sweet smelled like dark fruits and bourbon-ey. The taste was definitely chocolate-y (like a cupcake almost) and roasty with hints of coffee.  It was a cold day so this beer was a great warmer. The oak aging was not as prominent, but still served as one piece of the complex flavor-tasting puzzle.",0.6316637137699749,4.5,0.7113
Second Fiddle,"Opens with a massive froth that settles into an extremely cloudy amber body. Upon the initial pour, their is a substantial mango nose. There is little lacing once settled; the head is flimsy and loose. Take a slow sip; there is a blanket of lemongrass, pineapple and pepper overwhelming the palate. Maybe, a little sweetness in here? No bitterness either. This is a wonderful DIPA from an excellent brewery. (See My Review.) That said, this one is not for the novice.",0.663404422838954,4.5,0.7102

Blanc De Blancs,"Acts exactly like champagne. Foams up immediately, recedes quickly, bubbles rising from nucleation sites on the bottom of the glass. Crazy musty aromas, with a Moscato-like sweetness. Between the musty funk and sweet white wine aromas, the jaw-aching tartness from the first sip is a bit of a shock.

Appearance: Clear yellow with lots of head Nose: lots of pine, honey, candied sugars Taste: grapefruit, pine, lemon, lemon drop candy, white grape. Finish has a little bitterness, tartness. Feel: Light to medium and bready This is a lemony, champagne light IPA. Interesting beer  Updated review: Drank a day after canned (8/8 release) had to bump the taste up after that.

Chocolate Rain,"Beautiful brown ale poured into a Firestone taster. The smell is intoxicating. Lots of dark chocolate. Lots of booze. Loads of oak. This is a whiskey lovers desert. The taste is like a whiskey white russian. Very amazing chocolate, whiskey, coffee flavors in there. The best stout I have ever tasted. Lots of boozy bite on the tongue and very warming, but very smooth for 18.5%. Bravo Bruery, bravo! Can't wait to age on of these bad boys. 2013 series.",0.5748291925409427,5.0,0.7082
Green,"L: Murky (hazy), pale orange with copious white foam. It is a beautiful beer to look at. S: Loads of citrus. Orange and tangerine. T: Citrus punch with a dry finish. The hop resins compliment the citrus flavours well. F: Sort of a rawness to this beer that feels like a peppery rye beer. Perhaps the alcohol (7.5%) burn? O: It's difficult to reconcile this beer with my drinking experience here in Ontario. There's not really a lot to compare it to. I guess the freshness (had on the day after it was canned) is part of the appeal, making for a raw beer. I wonder how it would taste after a while. Would it soften some of the mouthfeel? Could it be a smooth, creamy sipper?",0.6735325784785547,4.25,0.7072
Green,"Green draws long lines for its IPA rep. It's subtler than other IPA's, less hoppy than expected. Pours into the lightest haze of the Tree House beers I've had. Smell is crispy hop with fruity hints. Tastes less bitter than expected and more juicy, like a subtler version of the fruitier TH brews. The hop backbone is a bit more obvious though, with the hop-volume turned up a bit. Feel is thinner on the palette – so I have to chase the flavors a bit more as they dart between subtle orange to spruce gum. Like other TH offerings, it's smoother drinking than you'd expect. A terrific beer.",0.6837061711089512,4.5,0.707
Black Tuesday,"Holy crap, huge beer (2012 vintage). First time with the BT. Weren't sure what to expect when we cracked this, after a few whiffs and a couple of sips, cracked the benchmark by which I compare all BA Stouts to - BCBS. While the BCBS (2012) got the BT today in smoothness, drinkability, overall experience, the BT was damn good, albeit, HOT! I would go as far as to say, as big as it is today, it may have more potential than BCBS in the future. The BCBS is just so damn good right now. Glad we have a few bottles of the BT to age, look forward to revisiting in 12-18 months. We should have sat on this one longer, but glad we tried it.",0.4812528922395813,4.25,0.706

The bitterness of the hops is extremely well balanced and does not overwhelm the palate. No unpleasant aftertaste. Feel: Heavy carbonation. Full-bodied beer.

Swish,"Canned 4/7/17; drank 4/16/17 @ the Yarchives.   Opaque yellow/orange appearance.   A violent pour yielded a huge off-white head; strong, frothy tree-run lace.   Pineapple, orange citrus & watermelon jolly rancher notes in the nose.   Medium mouthfeel.   Grapefruit & pineapple flavors up front; watermelon jolly rancher notes on the finish. No booze heat.   Too much mosaic (the watermelon jolly rancher flavor) for me to embrace, but this is a well-made NE IPA. It's just not for me.",0.619970669540049,3.75,0.705
Beatification,"Batch #6 (I think) bottle from trade, dated 9/11/13. Pours to my tulip a light yellow golden color with a small fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Lots of bubbles coming up from the bottom. Aroma is nice tart lemon, yeast funk, some pleasant citrus-like sweetness, light vinegar (very light on that note), apricots, lots of lacto acidity. Flavor is a nicely balanced sweet and sour lemon, lots of lactic tartness, dry oak, dry dusty Geuze-like qualities yet a nice sweet citrus character to balance. Some wine like qualities with Sauvignon blanc type of acidity. Light bodied with high carbonation and a crisp finish. This is really nice, but I can’t ever see paying $18 for a small bottle myself. Differentiating sour beers is tough I guess. With that said no doubt I would drink this again. Yum.",0.7090154130894099,4.25,0.705
Scaled Up,"A moderately aggressive pour yields a slightly hazy golden orange brew with 2 fingers of rocky white head with good retention that leaves moderate lacing. Aroma is peach, pineapple, grapefruit, a bit of pale malt, and a whiff of alcohol. Taste follows the nose, fairly juicy upfrobt. Dank with peach and pineapple upfront, more subdued mango and citrus, a touch of pale malt. A moderate bitterness; finishes fairly dry. Medium body and carbonation. It is probably 85% of the haze that I expect from Trillium but has all of the juiciness. It really seems that they have dailed in the new facility at Canton as this beer is excellent.",0.6925585115232098,4.5,0.705
Enjoy By IPA,"canned on 5/29/17-- Enjoy by 7/4/17.  Pours a very slightly cloudy medium amber color. 1 finger head that sticks around for a bit. Not a ton of lacing.  Aroma is great. Mangos, banana, pine, orange, lemon, wheat, peach, malts. Very fruity and creamy.   Taste is bitter grapefruit and smooth malts. Lots of citrus. Was expecting more fruit based on the nose but the bitterness dominates a bit.  Dry and bitter finish that makes you want to keep sipping.   Overall, a great DIPA. A bit too bitter for my taste but great nonetheless.",0.6924172685266434,4.5,0.705

Todd The Axe Man,"Wow the can artwork on this beer looks both interesting & frightening. On to the pour, It certainly looks the part of an IPA with an orange color. I was expecting more an east coast IPA that had a fair amount of malts to go along with bitter hoppiness that these beers tend to bring to the table. Well it does taste edgy & bold but the bitterness is a bit much for me to get into. Cheers! B-",0.6389447958808165,3.5,0.7043
Nelson,"Best by date of April 16th, 2016  Appearance - Pours a slightly hazy, pale golden yellow with a white, finger width head. Good retention, then dissipates to to a thin, broken layer of surface suds. Not much lace, save a few spots around the glass.  Smell - Hoppy with almost no malt in the aroma to speak of. Tropical notes of pineapple and mango stick out over the citrus and pine. Distant spice.   Taste - Mango is the predominant flavor here, while pineapple, citrus and pine follow up to add complimentary character. Maybe a touch of green banana? Rye spice kicks in near the finish, adding black pepper bite that rides out with moderate citrus pith bitterness.  Mouthfeel - On the plus side of medium with lightly bitey carbonation. Almost velvety texture on the swallow with a dry finish.  Overall - Pretty delicious hop profile, but the lack of balance is making it hard to finish this bottle. A bit of malt would go a long way to help break up the sharp, acidic hop attack that this beast displays. That I gave it the score I did is a testament to the amazing hop profile, but buyer beware that it is a double-edged sword.",0.6912006533207925,4.0,0.7034
Beatification,"A: Light golden, a bit hazy with a white foamy head that quickly fades to a ring.  S: Earthy, fruity nose, a touch of lemon and grass.  T: Tart lemon, orange, oak and white wine flavors, the overused barrels that they use really help to mellow out the tartness.  M: Medium bodied.  O: The mellowness of this beer makes it the most drinkable sour I've ever had. Is it the best? It's hard to say. They all taste somewhat similar within their respective styles to me. 95",0.683845715833653,4.5,0.7029
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"The beer comes in a hazy yellow orange color.

O: Yikes, I cracked a bottle tonight solo, and I can't stop drinking it. I'm glad the weather has cooled down some here otherwise I'd wouldn't be cracking this open until next fall.

Green,"Pours murky peach or golden wheat fields (SRM 3). The white creamy head reaches a half inch for about a minute before settling to a thin blanket. Fine lace coats a Spiegelau IIPA glass.  The aroma is dominated by hops. It is reminiscent of a pail of musty hop pellets. Light pine, mango, and dried oregano are also discernible.  This is quite bitter upon entry, and lingers all the way through a long finish. It tastes exactly as it smells with no progression or layers; it is uniform front to back. There is a mild sweetness.  The body is full and velvety smooth with modest carbonation. Sharp bitterness is subdued by the fullness of the body. Alcohol is present to the level expected. Green is very dry and becomes chalky with warmth.  I enjoyed this one on a summer afternoon amidst the calm and the company of a small, fluffy dog.

The nose on this beer is fantastic - peach cocktail. Taste is lightly tart with peaches and perhaps apricots. Mouthfeel is light and lively with an assertive acidity.

Chocolate Rain,"Pours black withi a still, oily look to it. Head foams up to a finger in height, but disappears quickly. Foam is khaki in color. Aroma is booze from the moment the wax-covered bottle cap is cracked open. In addition to heavy booze (via bourbon) is chocolate, vanilla bean, toffee, molasses, coffee and roasty, toasty malts. There is a hint of char at the finish. Flavor profile follows suit, with sugary notes of chocolate, vanilla bean, toffee, molasses, caramel and brown sugar mingling with lightly bitter notes of roasty, toasty malts, coffee and char. Booze and bourbon is present throughout, adding a substantial level of heat even after aging the bottle for a couple years. Alcohol turns the finish to dry, rinsing away the initial sweetness. Mouth feel is thick and full, but with a rather still texture. Overall, heavy, filling and with plenty of heat. It's a bottle worth sharing, but sparingly.

Citra presence makes it easy to drink.  O - Lack of carbonation and a bland nose are wiped away by delicious Citra hops.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"review of 2014 Gold wax KBBS. First I would like to say that I have had a good 4 ounce pour of 2013 kbbs on two separate occasions and this 2014 was shared with my friend with 6oz pours each.  A: 4.25/5 pours an almost solid black with quarter inch mocha head from a semi vigorous pour. head fades to nothing within a few seconds.   S: 4.5/5 maple forward with a strong coffee presence followed by slight alcohol and fudge. not nearly as sweet smelling as last year and lacking that beautiful maple syrup and chocolate bomb of last years batch.   T: 4/5 at first there is nice sweet maple but then the huge coffee astringency hits you and bitter coffee dominates the palate. The barrel and maple are there but are overshadowed by the coffee. though the huge coffee profile may subside over time, It seems that the bitter astringency will never fade as its a bitterness oily issue.   M: 4/5 not nearly as creamy and silky as last years or even lesser beers like Assassin. The finish from the coffee is almost slightly dry and the maple and barrels don't shine as they should.   O: 4.25/5 Overall this is a good beer that unfortunately happens to not be the beer that it was in 2013. 2013 was a life changing experience and almost didn't disappoint in anyways. I enjoyed drinking 2014 but was turned off by the unbalanced coffee presence and bitter astringency.",0.6248668606540937,5.0,0.6934
Haze,"My 1st Treehouse brew I was able to trade for. Canned 8/13/16 poured into Teku glass. Milkshake haze orange appearance brings an insane aroma of pineapple, mango orange when I popped open the can. Taste is mango, orange hoppy goodness with a very boozy finish I was not expecting (but enjoyed). Overall very crushable the alcohol burn on the finish is what pushed this to almost a 5 for me most juice bombs I have had are a little too sweet.

T- The dry light barnyard note has a slight watery taste before a full fruit flavor with a soft tartness come in to play. There is a light dark cherry note in the finish that takes on a slight jammy quality. The finish has notes of old wood and a light aspirin brett hint.

Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,2015 version. Very coffee forward beer. Some bitterness on back end. Some medium barrel aging comes through in taste and smell with mild alcohol notes. This became more prominent as beer warmed above 60 degrees. A stellar coffee beer. I prefer BCBCS though that's not really a knock against this brew.  Drank again. 2016 version with about 9 months age on it. Unimpressed this time. Coffee and stout flavors could both be stronger.

Scaled Up,"Poured from a growler filled today at the canton brewery into a tulip.   Haze bomb. Yellow with and almost brown core - slippery quick head dissipates quickly.   Smell is almost too hop forward - a bit more malt could reign in the extreme bouquet of dank, peach, and citrus. A little pine in there too.   Taste is fantastic. I mean, all flavors are intense and rather bitter for a trillium beer, just like the single version of scaled. Sweeter notes of peaches, orange, grapefruit, and spiciness hit the palette hard before bitter aspect of the hops come in with notes of grass, pine, and earthiness. Leaves a dank linger.   This is a light dipa, but the pure hoppy thickness of this beers makes it heavier than the abv would suggest.   This beer is so hoppy, I would have found it unimaginable only a few years ago.

A: Dark golden orange and hazy with a finger of mousse-like foam that rapidly recedes, leaving scattered lacing.   S: The aroma brings to mind mineral, wet leather, grass, and musty barnyard characteristics. The hops impart lemon, orange, white grape, and melon. A peppery spiciness pervades the olfactory, blending nicely with citrus zest. Tangerine is pronounced. There's a light woody quality.  T: Up front tartness segues into a pleasant midpalate pixie stix sweetness. This tantalizing sweet-tart sensation persists. Fruit abounds, reminiscent of orange, grapefruit, and lemon. Lightly peppery with leather, grass, earth, oak, and brackish notes. There's a low level of bitterness throughout. The finish is mildly tannic with lingering notes of leather, lemongrass, and tangerine.  M: Medium body with lower medium carbonation. The carbonation is interesting in that it was high initially but it seemed to quickly disappear. The mouthfeel is dry, sticky, and tannic.  Overall: The combination of New Zealand hops and Saison makes for a unique and refreshing beer. I wish this 375ml bottle would double in size.",0.6918065970771301,4.5,0.6783
Nelson,"This beer pours a very hazy goldenrod with a large, fluffy head. The aroma offers up strong lemon and lemongrass, caraway seed and some muted pineapple. The flavor is dry and savory, with the caraway and rye bread flavor playing a solid background role to the leading players of the lemony, lemon grass, lemon pepper- pretty much every lemon influenced spice - flavor, the muted, not to sweet tropical notes of pineapple, and a background hint of pine. The mouthfeel is fizzy and full. Overall this is a stellar beer. There was a lot of hype when these bottles came around, but this beer was worth it.",0.6717180152429933,4.75,0.6767
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Was a 2005 bottle  Look was a nice hazy typical geuze color.

Nectarine Premiere,"Incredible pour, super hazy absolutely no transparency. bright yellow and shiny, just beautiful. The nose on this thing is stupid, my mouth gleeks with anticipation, so much juicy fruit, Nectarines are pouring out, super ripe. The blind taste test I gave to some friends had them all guessing the stone fruits immediately. The taste is nothing short of amazing, this has to be one of my very favorite from de Garde and maybe one of my all time favorite Farmhouse Ales- it's been a long time since a beer blew my expectations but this is a special bottle. I've got 2 more of these bad boys and was thinking of trading them but I might not be able to after this.",0.5905414963629649,4.75,0.6754
Haze,"Pours a hazy, bright orange coloration with a small, fizzy head. Smells intensly of hoppy tropical and citrus aromas: passion fruit, guava, grapefruit and tangerine. Taste follows the nose, with a very hop-forward, juicy and slightly dank taste of tropical and citrus fruits: passion fruit, guava, grapefruit and tangerine. Almost no malt detectable at all. Pretty sweet and a little zesty, with a very light bitterness coming through in the aftertaste. V ery nice, smooth and creamy mouthfeel with medium carbonisation. This reminds me a LOT of Other Half Double Mosaic Daydream, without quite reaching its mouthfeel, but a slightly nicer balance and bitterness.",0.6929322942325415,4.5,0.6753
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"375 mL bottle. Black with a medium khaki head. Smell is rich coffee, fudge, and bourbon. Very nice. Taste is sharper coffee. Still pretty rich. Chocolate. Nutty malts. Bourbon and booze in the back. Rich and heavy. Medium carbonation. Very nice coffee flavor, but it has that nutty flavor that I don't love.",0.6536293983569955,3.75,0.6748
Chocolate Rain,"Reviewed on 10/1/17, from notes 2017 vintage L - Pours deep toffee color with a thin khaki head. S - The aroma is very similar to Black Tuesday. Lots of bourbon and ethanol. Also lots of dark fruits. I only get hints of chocolate, vanilla, and char. T - The flavors are typical bourbon notes; vanilla, oak, char, and hints of caramel. There are sweet chocolate undertones throughout. But there is a big ethanol bitter finish. F - Thin body, but a little sticky O - I'm a little disappointed. The overall experience is good, but doesn't knock my socks off. That ethanol finish was a killer. This is a relatively fresh bottle and it could just use some age.  Edit: opened a '15 bottle and it's way better than '17 fresh. The reduced ethanol flavors allow the chocolate flavor and aroma to really come out. Score adjusted up from my original 4.3 average.",0.6519661575681646,4.5,0.6746

Green,My first TH from friend. Outstanding hazy golden color with lacing poured in a pint glass as you drink. Pungent hop/citrus aroma follows with a mouthful with a smooth citrus taste that settles on the tongue and palette. Not bad but not to stand in line for. I'll have to try other varieties when I can.,0.6690266850817483,4.25,0.6731
Dragonsaddle,"Poured out as a nice looking orange color with a decent white head on top. The smell of the beer is heavily hopped, lots of pine and tropical fruit notes here. The taste of the beer is balanced really well with the big malt bill and even more hops to cut right through. The feel is smooth. Overall a very solid Triple IPA.",0.6764833917905734,4.5,0.6728
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Stark black with a surprisingly high rising dark mocha foam. With a slight hiss, it slowly settles down to a slick smooth surface with a thin ring. Dark sticky brown legs display after a swirl.  Smell is dark chocolate syrup, dark fruit, charred bourbon barrel, pulverized maple-glazed nuts, and, at the tail end, a slight sting.  Taste brings sweet black cherry skin with dark chocolate, a hint of marshmallow and cocoa dusted fig, as purple grape gummies arise in the swallow. The bourbon doesn’t seem to come through as much as I expected in flavor. Aside from a bit of char, it’s almost closer to Port when combined with the formidable clout of the Dark Lord and his bulbous cherries.  Thick, viscous, syrupy and gloppy with a barely there fine fizz and a slightly stinging heat, BADL finishes sticky and semi-dry. Well, what else did you expect?  2017 sparkly green wax vintage",0.6424071118582553,4.25,0.6728
Beer:Barrel:Time,"2018 on-site from SP Cellar. L: Dark - very black with some brown. Little head, you can see the thickness if you swirl the glass. S: Typical nose of a bourbon barrel aged beer, but more intense on the chocolate and vanilla, T: Chocolate roast up front, a little bit of booze from the bourbon (in just the right way), and then some pure barrel at the end that I really enjoyed. F: Thickest mouthfeel I think I've had on a beer, at least one with no flavors mixed in. O: Perfect no-adjunct stout. Doubt you could make it more smooth.",0.6271708866984265,5.0,0.6718

Chocolate Rain,Look is a deep black with a very minimal dark head. Though not as dark or as opaque as expected.  Smell is of chocolate and not much else taste is overpowering chocolate. To much chocolate and to sweet for me. I didn't get any other flavors or alcohol burn over the chocolate mouthfeel is fairly thick given the high abv overall I would not seek this out again. Simply too much chocolate for me. Like an alcoholic chocolate milk or something,0.6446744678368538,3.75,0.6705

Like just a small tan ring of medium bubbles, not impressive on first impression. Dark as night body. Chocolate, coffee, roast and walnut finish on the nose. Taste is where this shines! Dark chocolate, smooth bourbon and wood, mild cinnamon, dark fruits, vanilla. Building spice from the habanero but I'm not deterred.

Peche 'n Brett,This beer might be as good as it gets for me especially in terms of style. Logsdon makes an unreal saison. Their brett version is one of my top ten beers I've had and I love peaches. This beer delivered all of that. The color of the body almost had a peach skin note to it. The beer smells of fresh peaches. The taste is everything that is great about Seizoen Bretta but with beautful peach and floral notes. I can't recommend this enough and can't wait to get myself a bottle.,0.6136139155285932,5.0,0.6689
Sang Noir,"Comparing this 3 Floyd's Pear Bear this sour is much more balanced. Although there is no head, the beer aged in wine and bourbon barrels for two years with cherries is utterly amazing.

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2013 bottle. That was EXTREME, could feel the smell from the bottle and the off flavors here were kind of unpleasant in the first 15-20 minutes. The funk was so strong we couldnt have the first sip, and i'm not talking about horsey aromas but some kind of fishey/rotten food/mold and more. After waiting for the beer to get warmer the aromas morphed into something more fruity and the framboise finally came up. Very very sour on the palate, mid carbonation.

Mastermind,"Traded for this beer a while ago, as it had the date of 6/24/16 on the bottom of the can with ""C U @ SPAC"" written underneath that. Unlike many of the beers that I've had in my cellar that I'm finally getting around to, this didn't hold up that well and I'm sure it would be a zillion times better fresh. I still vowed to review everything that I'm going through and this certainly won't be an exception to that rule!  Not crazy about the pour to this as the liquid was golden, topped with plenty of fast settling head, and left behind enough rings of lacing as I worked my way through this. A bit of sediment could be seen in the liquid but it wasn't as much as I would have originally thought. Both the aroma and taste were a mess here - skunked Citra, weed, Caramel Malt, urine, and evergreen made me feel like I walked in on a Phish concert (and no, I don't listen to them). Just too much going on here and not in a good way, as this felt heavy and old on the palate with not enough carbonation to keep things light...  Plenty of booze here and this felt much more stronger than it was an actuality. Someday, I'll get a new can of this and give it another go.

The aroma is of pungent, fruity hop oils and white bread crust. Taste is of those elements, with very strong, and even harsh, hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is high medium, and Sip of Sunshine finishes mostly dry.   RJT",0.6809512219168793,4.75,0.659
Mastermind,"Can dated 08/19/16.  Pours hazy pale yellow with a half-inch off-white head that remains as a cap on top and leaves strands of lace. The smell is dominated by tropical fruit and citrus juice with just a hint of pine. The taste begins with bitter grapefruit and orange rind then, fades into pineapple and mango sweetness on the finish. Full texture with crisp carbonation. Very good.",0.6546085809795014,4.0,0.659
Green,Cloudy straw appearance with significant white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a mild citrus without any hoppyness. Taste is a very pleasant citrus with a hoppy accent.,0.6512379056567752,4.5,0.659
Oude Geuze Vintage,"375ml corked & caged bottle from 04/12/2005 poured into a small table glass at Delirium Cafe.  Pours a slightly hazy deep amber with a very small head that fades fast. Woah! This nose is crazy, funky tart and very old and musty smelling, like nothing else I've had.  Not for the faint of heart, this is a very hardcore sour. It tastes old and tart and it'll make your face pucker. There's a lot of that barnyard wet blanket funk to it. It's a super slow sipper but totally worth a try.",0.5928688129697512,3.5,0.6577
Society & Solitude #4,"On draft at Three Penny Taproom, $7.50 for 8 oz (?) pour. Appearance is a murky, yellow-orange, with a tall, thick, creamy head that coats the glass. Aroma is a medley of tropical fruits with a hint of herbal/spice hops, not super aromatic. Taste is delicious. Mango, pineapple, orange, a hint of spice, a soft, muted bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is about perfect. Overall, an incredible DIPA, a little pricey, but glad I had it.",0.6676877026128827,4.75,0.6577
Beatification,"Sparkling vibrant gold with a large, airy off-white foam disappearing into a shimmering, lightly bubbling surface.  Aroma is a mix of white wine and slightly spicy, funky aged cheese and hay with sharply sour notes of tangerine, white grape and toasty, drying white oak. There's a bit of bread far in the background.  Taste is sharply sour with a complex woodiness. White wine, green grape and toasted seed flavors mingle well with each other. A nice oaky swallow adds an odd, toasty bitterness that may be contributing a touch of wild greens.  An effervescent carbonation turns into an airy froth through a smooth, medium body with a tangy, semi-dry finish.  2017 vintage",0.7077999794035619,4.25,0.6573
Sure Bet,"White head. Lace. Golden orange color. Clear, not hazy.   The mango purée shows a lot. Floral and herbal. Orange citrus. Some resin and stickiness. Abv is hidden pretty well.  Not bad for an imperial, but I still prefer the haze.",0.614530092639526,4.25,0.657
Sure Bet,"Poured into whatever IPA glass I have available (I hope I can get a Pipeworks drinking device real soon btw)  L: Golden. A little hazy. Not much head as expected with the ingredients. Ready to drink quickly for sure!  S: Tropical fruit aka the mango of course. Just as advertised.  T: The smell leads into the taste perfectly. Honey hit, then mango, then citra hops...it is just enjoyable all the way through to be honest. Bitter hop finish and I want more!  F: It is almost like drinking a DIPA Mango Smoothie. An enjoyable one.  O: To put it simply, I want to drink this beer year round at various times and wish I could get it more often. Trying not to be a Pipeworks fanboy but this works just as advertised. Drink it if you like the idea of honey and a lot of mango taste dominating your DIPA but just remember that this is a 9.5% beer because it could really do some damage.",0.5749038499478664,4.75,0.6564

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"2018 Vintage  A - Very dark brown to black in color with very creamy lacing on top that's dense, sticky, and toffee colored. Sticks to the side of the glass like glue and has lots of legs.  S - Nose is intense and complex: Chocolate roast, some char, roasted cocoa, Bourbon, a slight hit of wood, and cream.  T - Robust flavor: Full of roasted cocoa and chocolate, vanilla, char, light smoke, oak, Bourbon, some cherry, and finishes with lingering Bourbon and charred cocoa.  M - Thick and chewy, some alcohol effervescence permeates through the sinuses and lip smacking sticky.  O - This is a ""fantabulous"" beer. Expensive, but worth the price of admission.",0.6284970783567146,4.5,0.6542

Initial impression is juicy citrus, caramel, tropical fruit, pineapple, and a slight pine-y hops bitterness. Very smooth, nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is quite hefty; carbonation is on the light side. Finish is sweet fading to a slight bitterness on the back of the tongue. Very, very well done.",0.6911520020322015,4.25,0.6542

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Bottled in 02. Thanks, mikey711.  Who needs fresh fruit when you have Lou Pepe Framboise? The raspberry character is so marked you can feel the drupelets on your tongue. Something in the acid has kept them in stasis.  It's sour enough to remind you of a vinaigrette. A funky, oaky vinaigrette. How many vitamins are still present in this liquid? Is it feasible to make this my primary source of dietary fiber? These are the questions I ask myself.  Upending the bottle, I expect to see whole raspberries in suspension. Nope, just yeast porridge. I drink it anyway.",0.6181794093893572,4.0,0.6531

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,A: Pours a thick foamy head. Color of a ripened apricot. Bubbles and light sediment floating around.  S: So yeasty and malty. Bananas and cloves are front and center as well.  T: Starts off with a mix of bananas and cloves and melds into a nice long bready finish.  O: Unbelievably creamy and smooth. Has to be the best beers of this style I've ever had.,0.6735105802219855,5.0,0.6524
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"2010 vintage and bottled in April, courtesy of thagr81us. Thanks for picking this up for me Calton.  This beer pours a red raspberry bright red in color with a slight white lacing around my snifter. The nose is incredibly sour, acidic, funky, earthy, and has some yeast to it. It's probably the most sour nose of an beer not named Cantillon. This one is pretty sour. It's so sour that you can't get much cherry, or perhaps I should say any traditional cherry or a cherry pie/cobbler. It's almost pure acid. It's also a little vinous. I like it, it just isn't overly complex. It can't be. It drinks lighter in body with moderate carbonation. This is a really nice Kriek and I've had it before. 2005s are insane right now but I feel this is in its awkward teenage stage, at just under two years old.",0.6590925846675112,4.0,0.6514
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"In review is a 2012 Vintage.  A - Pitch black pour with moderate toffee lacing, lots of legs on the sides of the glass, sticky lacing, little to no carbonation.  S - Roasted chocolate malt, a hint of charcoal on the nose, bourbon, and a little bit of oak. The overall nose is extremely mellow (probably because of the age of the bottle).  T - Lots of roasty cocoa from start to finish, oak woodiness, delicate bourbon that's not overpowering in any way at all - perfectly blended, some small hits of black licorice, and ends with a mellow lingering roasted cocoa with light char, bourbon, and some black licorice on the very back end. No heat whatsoever on the way down  M - Full bodied with a silky/velvety feel on the tongue, lip smacking sticky on the lips.  O - This 2012 bottle is spectacularly impressive.",0.6583094146346591,4.5,0.6502
Haze,Pours with a thick frothy head and has the appearance of orange-pineapple juice and tastes citrus like with a hint of pineapple in the nose. This is a fairly drinkable brew for 8.2% abv. One of my new favorites brewed on 03/05/2019,0.6313290582277985,4.75,0.6486
Aaron,"A-Black in the glass, clear amber brown when pouring, not much head or carbonation.  S-Lots of caramel, toffee, leather, maybe even a smoke like flavor? brown sugar along with oak and slight bourbon  T-The bourbon is not very present, instead, caramel, toffee, leathery flavors dominate. Brown sugar as well. Nicely balanced and rather smooth. The alcohol is hidded perfectly.  M-Medium bodied, not much carbonation and slightly thin.  O-Not a bourbon bomb at all, more of a balanced english barleywine. The flavors are not mind blowing, but the balance is so dialed in.",0.6783016085961198,4.75,0.6486

Schaerbeekse Kriek,"750ml bottle - Delirium cafe  I astutely noted that they actually gave us the wrong beer - the 25 Euro Schaerbeekse Kriek instead of the 13 Euro Oude Kriek. Jackpot.  The label was molded and eroding - the beer was deep garnet and as tart as advertised. This kriek uses tarter cherries than the Oude Kriek which was pretty transparent. I preferred the 7-year old Oude Kriek and its decadent finish, but this was a nice treat as well. Tart, notes of balsamic, enamel decaying bite.",0.5461613304968527,4.5,0.6486

Chocolate Rain,"Bottle. 2013. Shared at tasting and transcribed from notes.  Conspicuously light chocolate brown with an anaemic tan head that quickly dissipates to a collar.  Ripping vanilla, 70% dark chocolate, frangelico, liquorice, cocoa and steadily growing hazelnut presence. Big and brash.  Similar but booze and sweetness causes a loss of structure and focus. Mainly big, sugary barrel contributions of vanilla essence, coconut and Frangelico.  Not hugely thick or heavy, but marred by the distracting, hot booze presence.  Some delectable flavours but lack of drinkability is a big problem. Going to sit on my other bottle for a good few years.",0.6474182668512687,3.75,0.6486
Enjoy By IPA,"12oz bottled 9/24/17 poured into a teku glass at fridge temp 9.4% ABV. The beer pours bright light honey in color with a hint of orange. The head is off white, sticky and persistent. Lacing is prevalent. The aroma is pine, citrus and light honey. The taste is semisweet caramel, pine and citrus in classic west coast style. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and bitter & dry in the finish. Overall, still outstanding. This EB 10/31/17 is the first I've tried in years. The last few times I had it (2015), I was overwhelmed with onion aroma that I could not get over. This is back on point.",0.6639598390695034,4.25,0.6486

Has the flavors of tart green apples, lemons, yeast, grapes, oak, and pears.   Medium bodied with average carbonation. Has a tart green apple aftertaste, and is extremely drinkable. Finishes dry.

Wow, this is right up my alley. Tons of resin and spicy hops. Dankness and oniony hops. Yum. The tropical fruit comes through here and there though not as strong as in the nose.

But, mostly pineapple, tangerine and other exotic fruits really deliver on the flavor with the noticeable Galaxy hops. Creamy mouthfeel and very easy to drink.  Yet another phenomenal beer from Tree House. As far as IPAs overall, it's between this and Julius (which has a distinctly different taste and aroma).",0.6746321236292778,5.0,0.6474

Huge aroma at the crack of the can with floral tropical hops hinting at passion fruit, mango, and melon. Bold extra-juicy citrus and tropical notes from the Citra and Mosaic hops: passion fruit, lemon-lime, grapefruit and mango; light caramel malt adds some grainy sweetness. Medium body, quite resinous, ample carbonation, finishing bittersweet. Overall, really good juicy IPA made with two great hops!

Double Orange Starfish,"Received from @SomethingClever – thanks Dave! 16 oz can dated: Fight Milk 4/18/17, stored at 42 degrees. Served at 42 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Aroma – citrus and pine, weak. Head large (Maximum five cm, aggressive pour), off white, medium density froth, average retention, diminishing to an irregular one to four mm ring and a three-dimensional partial ring of tiny to small bubbles and a rocky large island. Lacing – very good. Complete rings of tiny to small bubbles with stalactites and an occasional column connecting rings. Body – light yellow, very hazy. Flavor – actually kind of weak. Slightly bitter and generically citrusy. No malt, no alcohol, no diacetyl. It does cause a slight burning around my cardiac sphincter. Palate – medium, watery, lively carbonation.  Not a bad beer, but hardly seems bitter enough to be a DIPA. The alcohol content throws it into DIPA territory and is so well hidden this seems like a session pale ale. Be careful – I can see a sixer of theis going down in record time.  Appearance 4.5, Aroma 3.5, Flavor 4, Palate 4.25, Overall 4.25.",0.6747019320450001,4.25,0.6441

Nose of nectarine ice cream, mango, candied pineapple, crushed grains, slight black pepper, guava and a distant onion. Taste follows the nose with lots of sweet tropicals. Higher bitterness than normal for a Trillium smoothie with some decent drying. Medium+ sweetness and a low rolling carbonation leading to a soft medium body. A wonderful brew but nothing to freak out about. Maybe I've had too many Trillium brews.",0.6473060271656391,4.25,0.6439
Green,"Hazy yellow in the glass. Smell is a pineapple bomb up front. Hop resin, orange, and generalized citrus character is present as well. Definitely juicy. Taste is sweet and citrusy up front with a dry bitter on the back end. Classic NE IPA but just a touch too bitter for my own taste (not overtly so however). Feel is kind of thick for the style as the haziness is an indication of the particulate floating around. Excellent beer overall that is a touch too bitter for my own tastes but most would not find anything objectionable about it. Treehouse for the win; again.",0.6760116026648801,4.5,0.6428
Coolship Red,"In many ways this is the beer I’ve been journeying towards since diving into craft beer. A beer that, had I encountered it a few years ago, I would’ve undoubtedly enjoyed it but not to this level of depth.   This beer is unreal.  Sunset-red with an eggshell-white head that fades quickly. Raspberry personified.   Aroma is raspberry purée, leather, green apple, lemon, tart berries, oak and musty attic. Just an incredible aroma that speaks to the complexity of the beer.   Taste is simultaneously tart and fresh fruit and aged woody and earthy ale. An incredible juxtaposition. Fruit-forward and jammy but restrained from the sour blend. Toasted malt in the background, leather in the mix.   Tart, fruity and dry. Wine-like tannins but restrained acidity. World class.",0.6902600208940777,4.75,0.6428

Leaves lacing.  The aroma is alive with citrus, fruity and spicy characters. Cantaloupe and tangerine. Light toasted bread under currant.  The body is medium to bold but there is an acidic fuzziness to it.  The taste is a hop heads delight with all that tangerine and cantaloupe juiciness mixing with a citrus cleanliness leading to ma juicy, yet crisp and bitter finish. Another topnotch offering from this Vermont brewery.",0.6798398145668918,4.5,0.6428
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"A: Coming to expect this in Trillium beers. Super super cloudy with an almost mango juice color and consistency. A thin off white head dies down quickly.  S: Bomb. A mango and pineapple juice bomb with some dank citrus hop notes lurking. Smells incredible.  T: The taste doesn't quite stack up for me. On the maltier side of IPAs, especially for Trillium. Still incredibly clean. Light bready malt, mango, grapefruit and just a touch of green onion. Finished with just a tinge of grapefruit pith and resin. Another tasty beer from them, but not one of my favorites.",0.6563567180446979,4.25,0.6405

So good! The feel is creamy with some carbonation. Smooth! The flavor is different than most beer styles, but I could see this flavor could become a craving. This brand is exact to the description of a German Hefe Weiss!",0.6378002032244581,5.0,0.6375

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Dark black, very thick, a little bit of tan head. Smells amazing - coffee and a little bit of maple jump out at you, along with chocolate and vanilla and other sweet smells. The taste is no letdown either, coffee is more up front, and maple is on the back end, with a lot of caramel / chocolate / dark fruit in the middle. Super thick mouthfeel with zero alcohol burn.  I was fully prepared to be disappointed by this beer - not that I expected it to be bad, but just that it might not blow me away. I was wrong. Probably the best beer I've ever had.",0.6247114617894979,5.0,0.6365

Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Black with a ruby tinge when held to the light. Topped with a finger of dark, rusty brown head.  Smells of molasses, chocolate, vanilla, hazelnuts, black liquorice , whipped cream and a light smoky quality.  Tastes of black liquorice, coffee, vanilla, hazelnuts, dark chocolate, and hints of scotch. There's a light sweetness to this one. The wood notes from the barrel age come through more as I sip it.  Thick and slightly oily body, with a moderate amount of foamy, dry carbonation. Quite smooth for the style.   This bottle is a 2015 vintage, bought at Whole Foods in Davis California. Drinking in Chiang Mai, Thailand, Nov 14th, 2016. Really complex, very noteworthy and smooth, really growing on me as I drink it.",0.6346738149323492,4.25,0.6361

Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,"375ml bottle, served in a Side Project stemmed glass. Pours a dark black body, oily, with a bit of hulky leg, one finger offwhite head, short retention, bits of lacing. Smell is chocolate fudge, bourbon, a bit of nuttiness, slight roast, earth, a bit of espresso. Flavour is an unholy mix of bourbon, chocolate fudge, slight vanillin, brownie batter, touch of almond and roast, mildly earthy finish. Mouthfeel is fuller bodied, slightly lower carbonation than would be expected. Overall, an excellent barrel-aged imperial stout that hides its 15% abv extremely well.

Peche 'n Brett,"I enjoyed this brew, just not quite as much as I expected. The brett is well done and not overpowering, but I found myself wanting more fresh peach out of it. It's there on the nose, but not enough for me in the taste. I had it on tap in Eugene, so I'm not sure when it was brewed, but I assume fairly recently. I doubt the peach has mellowed with age, I just think that's what Logsdon was going for. The alcohol is certainly well hidden. Perhaps I'll give it another shot and revised as warranted. For me, good but not great.",0.6062146080549894,4.0,0.6322

Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"Pours out pitch black.  Aroma is bourbon, vanilla, maple, oak and chocolate as well.  Taste starts with bourbon goes into more maple sweetness and vanilla, lots of fudge/chocolate notes and an oaky dry finish.   Medium bodied, decently dry finish and a bit of alcohol in the aroma and on the finish. Not super boozy though.  Great beer, but not as maple forward as expected and a bit too light in the body and mouthfeel as well.

Second Fiddle,"From a 16oz can from 9/18  Big thick, soapy head that lasts forever on top of a predominately clear orange gold beer.   It smells and tastes really juicy with a ton of tangerine and some melon along with piney, bitter, resinous hops. It’s actually pretty bitter overall so the strong juicy flavor gives it a nice balance. It is a little bit toward the boozy and hefty end of the spectrum, but not heavy or syrupy in any way.   This is a really nice, and fairly unique tasting beer that strikes me as an Imperial Jai Alai. I haven’t come across that before",0.6764225744589363,4.25,0.6297

Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Very hazy, the color of lemon juice with a slight pink tinge. Decent head that dissipates rather quickly.  Super aromatic with a tropical melon bomb! Perhaps honeydew, or cantaloupe, with lots of lime and notes of white peach.  Taste very similar to the nose, with a little more bitter grapefruit, and even some more herbal, grassy flavours.  Very smooth, lightly carbed, with a an overall sweet taste. A little dryness from the bitter grapefruit, but it's pretty light. Dry sticky finish.",0.6765745315814198,4.25,0.6282

Nelson,"Pours a hazy peach with a two finger white head. Aroma is big citrus, grapefruit, tropical fruits, white wine/white wine grapes. Flavor follows with citrus, white wine, a zesty quality for lack of a better word, and a spicy bitterness from the hops and rye. Mouthfeel is medium and smooth, perfectly carbed for a rye ipa.

Beatification,"One of the last bottles shared at Hunahpu’s Day 2014, poured into souvenir taster. Hazy yellow with a white head that quickly disappears. No lacing to speak of. Aroma is basement must, citrus, especially lemon, tart sour grapes, vinegar, wood, and leather. Taste is a puckering sourness with citrus and vinegar notes, followed by some mellowing wood bitterness and earthy elements. A touch of citrus sweetness.

Black Tuesday,"This was nothing short of intense. Intensity in a bottle, in fact.  Pours… what do you think with a name like Black Tuesday? Doesn’t disappoint, either.   The aroma is just as big, bold, and overpowering. Monster stout plus dark Belgian ale plus barrel aging means there’s a lot to unpack: dark chocolate, coffee, raisins, figs, floral esters, vanilla, leather, and some booze all come to mind. Each sip unravels another element of the same. Lots of heat. Too much, in fact, to bring it together as it warms. At least for this reviewer I found the heat distracting when it should be inviting.

Beatification,"330mL bottle poured into taster - batch 5 - thanks rob  Pours a hazy golden straw yellow color with a bubbly white head. Retains for just a moment before dissolving into some cloudy film with a bit of lacing on the glass.   Punchy, intense tartness in the nose driven by an powerful lemony scent. Hints of citrus peel with funky wetness and hay. Light touch of oak with acid.   Zesty lemon and powerful sourness right off the bat. Citrus peel with funky tones and decent acidity. Puckering sourness continues throughout the profile, drying up on the tongue with some yeasty hints. Finishes with lemon and tartness.   Lighter medium body, slightly higher carbonation, dry, bubbly and extremely lingering on the tongue. If you're looking for an intensely sour beer that packs a punch you won't soon forget, this is the one.

Flavor completely lacks malt character. Hops are citrusy (lemon, orange, and a little lime) but not strong at all, kinda spritzy and thin. Mouth feel is too close to seltzer...refreshing but too thin for a DIPA. Overall it drinks like a session IPA. For a DIPA I want some thing that doesn't taste like its 4.5% and it needs some malt character. Not a bad beer, just not good for the DIPA style.",0.6789880452953747,3.0,0.6203
Double Orange Starfish,"My nephew brought this up after a visit to VA - what an awesome surprise as its my fave brewery.  Pours an densely opaque bright orange gold color with a tint of brown, like orange-pineapple juice, with a 1 1/2 finger silky bone-white head. laces nicely as the head dissolves.  Aroma is pungent with notes of orange and mango. A bit peppery with a dank green hops whiff to it.  Taste follows the smell with the orange flavor up front. There's an interesting tartness that blends with an alcohol burn that starts off low but takes over in the middle, lingering to the finish. This tartness counteracts the more fragile tropical sweet notes - a bit unfortunate but then there may not be enough sweet to begin with. Malt seems to be fairly low and bitterness is somewhat weak.  Feel is very soft. Not too sticky on the lips. It is seltzery up front as well.  This is not my favorite Aslin beer. They got the look and feel perfect IMO but I think the tartness is overpowering the subtleties of the hop flavor. That said I would have this over most beers out there. I'm a sucker for thick NEIPAs and they really have mastered the art form.",0.6763473626516204,4.25,0.62

Society & Solitude #4,From growler (under 2 weeks). Bright yellow-orange completely opaque/hazy appearance with a good bit of frothy foam and carbonation upon aggressive pour. Very citrus and tropical aromaticity. Loads of citrus fruit flavors. Sweeter taste. Creamy mouthfeel and little bit of a different finish than your typical NE IPA (different from Tree House and Trillium). Hard to describe but it works well and balances the citrus fruitiness.,0.7127097184620597,4.5,0.6187
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Cantillon Lou Pepe - Framboise | 750 ml. | 5.0% ABV | 2006 vintage   Brewer: Brasserie Cantillon Style: Lambic - Fruit Glass: Oversized wine glass   Presentation: Cantillon's stately bottles of beer could easily be confused for wine. The label art is very nice.   Appearance:  Gurgling reddish-pink with a towering head of pink fizz. Carbonation blasts up the sides of the glass.  Aroma:  Tart and sour -- mostly raspberry and sour fruit. As it warms, the oak seeps through nicely.  Taste:  Like getting slapped silly with a sour stick whilst rolling in a tub of the tartest raspberries ever to ferment in an oak barrel. My God! My mouth puckered like no other into a horrible grimace, dragging the other features along with it into a crumpled ball of agony and anguish.  Mouthfeel:  It's hard to judge such a quaint thing when your face has puckered in on itself. Smooth and light-bodied probably. There may have been crisp and ample carbonation.  Harmony:  Cacophony's more like it.  Would I get it again?: I would cellar it for an additional four years, which would hopefully tame its wild side. I would get it again to run this foolhardy experiment.  Bottled: 2006 Served: June 24, 2010",0.6458523780604035,2.0,0.6168

Some nice balancing maltiness that lends a light sweetness. Finishes with lingering tropical hop notes and bitterness  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A bit on the drier side  O: Very hoppy and on the bitter side, yet balanced. Super drinkable DIPA that is unlike most of the newer NE-style IPAs that don't have much (if any/fairly low) bitterness.

Green,"Green pours murky and hazy, light straw yellow with a tight 1-finger head which lingers leaving good lacing. Smell is juicy tropical and citrus with sweet pineapple, mango and ripe tangerine. There is a creamsicle hint to Green with a an earthy mate and touch of pine. Taste is quite bitter up front, for a NE style IPA, but has pineapple, papaya, tangerine and orange rind. The creamsicile seems to fade giving way a to bubblegum characteristic, as this a smoothness settles over your tongue and palette.",0.6380866291825998,4.5,0.6128

The flavor is tart with orange and tangerine citrus. Some grapes appear in the middle along with a touch of tropical fruit. It finishes a little salty (? maybe it's just me). Once gone the tart flavor and tangerine citrus lingers on the palate.  This is an easy drinking beer with lots of aroma and flavor.

Scaled Up,"16oz can poured into a teku  A- pours a hazy pale yellow color with a thin foamy white head that reduces to a thin film floating on top  S- smells of peach skin, peach gummy rings, white wine, orange, cracked pepper  T- peach skin, white wine, citrus, herbal, finishes citrusy  M- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel and finish  O- several elements blend into this one, pretty tasty",0.6413731217425671,4.25,0.6124
Haze,"16oz can. Pours a hazy (shocking) burnt yellow with an inch of frothy head. Good amount of lacing. The aroma is orange, peach, papaya, pineapple and pink grapefruit. The taste is papaya, orange and pink grapefruit. Peach and papaya towards the end with some bread crusts. Medium body with low carbonation. Pretty noticeable alcohol presence. Creamy mouthfeel.",0.6243830137033723,4.25,0.6124
Sure Bet,Look is a hazy grapefruit/orange color with 1.5 fingers white head.  Aroma is dank mango and then dank mango and then a little more mango.  Taste follows nose. Dank mango with near zero alcohol perception. It's good.  Feel is creamy and smooth.  Overall for me this is Pipework' s best hoppy beer. It's dangerously good and dangerously smooth.,0.683334299228827,4.75,0.6124
Second Fiddle,"Canned 3-1-18  Look: Light honey color. Medium head, and lacing. Smell: Light GF, earthy, pine, changing to a bit more on the citrus spectrum as it warmed. Nice hop aroma...very nice.  Taste: GF, citrus, earthy.. light pine bite. MF: Light to medium. Low carbonation, moderately bitter .. not overly.   O: What a bright, wonderful aroma.. yet, the taste was a bit disjointed. There was a bit of long lasting bitterness that hung on too long. A good beer, but the overall flavor was not on-point for me.",0.7105218509487997,4.0,0.6118
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"750ml corked and capped, split with my wife. Sticker on the bottle states 2005, bottled on 2007.  Pours a muddy red brown with a pinkish hue. A bit of head builds on the pour and instant disappears to a placid top.  This is certainly one of the more acidic lambics though I don't really expect anything less from Cantillon. This one is full of woody barrel which adds a really nice dimension to the tart raspberries, lemon pucker and a hint of grapes. Some nice funk that plays with your stomach later, not a ton of carbonation but ample, a real sipper. I rate it a little less drinkable simply due to the acidic nature.",0.6453605975860447,3.5,0.6115
Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Bottle pour at the pre-FWIBF bottle share held at the Adelaide Inn in Paso Robles, CA.  Pours a murky yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, fruit, white wine, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with sour grain, fruit, and white wine flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is tasty and refreshing.",0.6602338477114855,4.25,0.6115
Nelson,"Really good IPA. Not sure if I would describe it as a world beater, but I would definitely buy again. It's a little more bitter then I prefer, but I assume that must be th characteristics of the Nelson Sauvin hops. Has a definitely tropical, grapefruit taste going for it.",0.5936338130159953,4.25,0.6115

Beatification,"Poured from a 375ml bottle into a tulip glass. Batch #6  A- Pours a deep chardonnay golden yellow color. Has a very high wine like clarity. Small fizzy head that dissipated quickly.   S- Lots of sour apple, some vinegar, some light vanilla, good amount of oak. some white wine character in there.   T- Similar to aroma but amplified to an insane degree. Lots of tart lemon, sour apple, and vinegar. Finishes with a dry yeasty note. Has that old barn cellar thing that sours usually have.   M- Medium-light the flavor makes this a sipper.   O- This is one of the most sour beers I've had and if you're looking for something that delivers in the pucker department seek this one out. It is also somewhat too sour for me in my tastes. It's missing a bit of the subtlety that I got from Supplication. Still an amazing beer and if you want to test the limits of sour seek it out.",0.6663483090977195,4.25,0.61

Sip Of Sunshine,"Got this can from Zid. Thanks Chris!!  Pours a hazy orange gold with over a finger of foam. Plenty of sticky lacing.   Lots of tropical fruit in the nose, hop oiliness that thrills me. Lupulin always works for me. Ever since my first St Lupulin from Odell.   Tropical fruit with orange zest taste and mild cracker malt that adds some balance. Hoppy but with a low level of bitterness. Smooth as silk mouthfeel and taste as the alcohol never comes into play.   This is special and deserving of any praise given to it.",0.6501586348664228,4.75,0.6098
Haze,"Can to chalice. Thick head with lots of retention, lace on glass. Hazy orange color. Combination of tropical fruit and earthy dankness in the nose.

Juicy,"A - Hazy golden with light brown accents to it. Small white head   S - Grapes, light citrus from the mimosa, light oak, blue cheese funk as well for this.   T - You get a lot of Mimosa up front with the citrus coming through. There is also a lot of funk that leaves a strong blue chesse funk. The finish is tart and has some of the oak and funk that linger on  M - Thick body with a light creaminess to it. Finish is slightly dry  O - Call this a poor man's Mimosa. It is a really good sour that gets a ton of flavors from the Mimosa barrels which gives it a lot citrus to go with its tartness and blue cheese funk",0.6484448580369342,4.25,0.6083
Swish,Straw appearance that is very cloudy with significant white head that disipates slowly. Aroma is a hoppy with some citrus. Taste is a hoppy dominated citrus that would be better with a little less hoppyness.,0.6531329905068304,4.25,0.6077
Thicket,"poured from a 375mL bottle into a wine glass. pours a beautiful dark red with pinkish white head. smells of blackberry jam with some acidic funk. taste is similar with the jamminess taking the forefront. this is some tart cider! sour and acidic. feel is appropriate for the style. not overly bubbly. definitely on the thicker side of things. overall, damn sour but one of my favorites of the SP 375s.",0.6407949375507819,4.5,0.6076
Enjoy By IPA,Great beer! I was looking forward to this for a while I have the Black IPA as well I will review soon. This beer has all of the citrus taste and smell with a tad bit of caramel and a big grapefruit note. I don't believe anyone will be disappointed.

Haze,"My 500th Beer!   Look: Pours a golden peachy haze; white head. Tiny bit of lacing. Aroma: A blend of orange, peach, papaya and pineapple. Taste: It's complex - definitely need to have a precise palate for this one. Tropical and Stone fruits and some interesting yeast. Feel: Highly carbonated, soft and heavy. Overall: I know from tasting this beer how good it is - but I can't figure out exactly why. It's the kind of beer that makes me realize I need to get a beer tasting certification to know what's really going on.",0.6941627439396423,4.5,0.6049
Todd The Axe Man,"Drank this out of a English pub pint. Its a hazy yellow with soft white foam. The citrus hop smell is so intense I could smell it during pouring, a lot of hops went into this beer.

No evidence of roasty malt beyond the aroms, and none of coffee, the chocolate seems to just about totally dominate, which is far from bad. Probably surpasses my favorite chocolate stout, Samuel Smith's.",0.6138750701628232,4.5,0.6046

Green,"From a 16oz can, dated 06/20/17... let it grow. Served in a tulip.  Pours a full-on murky, dull yellow grapefruit juice colour with two fingers of super-soft, ivory-coloured suds. Slowly settles to a thick, foamy cap and a thick curtain of bubbly, webby lacing.  Smells weedy, oily, herbaceous and dank.   Tastes like bhang water and lemonade, all greasy and sexy. Herbal tea, pine needles, grapefruit peels and spunked-on blue jeans. Resinous, earthy, oily and dank with a long, lingering, dry, piney and pithy bitterness.  Feel is smooth and creamy, medium-hefty bodied, very well carbonated and drying.  I'm not sure why I haven't rated this before, I've had it several times, but I don't remember it being this utterly masterful in the past. Maybe the least Tree House-like of all the regular line up so hard to say 'better than this' or 'not as good as that' but, sweet merciful Dionysus, it left me with hop oils leaking out the corners of my eyes and a slight erection.",0.6524993674126782,4.5,0.6003
Oude Geuze Vintage,"677th Review on BA Bottle to Flute 330ML Red Label 2004  App- A soft yellowish orange with a one finger head even for a soft and small pour. Little bit of bubbles and lace.  Smell- After having more of the style I have come to appreciate it a whole hell of a lot more. Funky, musty, damp and yeasty.  Taste- This bottle was like gold in a glass. It was a bit dry, a bit tart, a bit funk but all good. Balanced between damp and sour and tingly.  Mouth- Still high carbed after all these years and a bit medium bodied.  Drink- I couldve drank a whole lot more. I can't imagine what trade value is for an 04, but I sure as shit want to find out.",0.622572964700018,4.5,0.5998

Sip Of Sunshine,"Orange, light amber color. Cloudy. Spotty lace from a moderate head.   Raw hop nose. Citrusy and spicy with a touch of orange zest.   The malt base is weak given the extraordinarily strong bitter hop. It makes one of the longest aftertastes I've ever experienced. Think of it as similar to sucking a hop pellet. Decent body and carbonation. Hop lovers will rejoice at this extreme version of an IPA.",0.6658853309348213,4.0,0.5994

Peche 'n Brett,L: Had on tap at Chuck's Hop Shop. Body is a cloudy golden yellow with a thin ring around the glass.   S: Fresh peach and citrus dominate the nose. Some funk in the background.  T: Quite citrusy for being made with peach. Starts with bright tart orange and lemon which transitions to a dry peach vineous nature at the end. It reminds me of champagne or a white wine. There is some mild funky straw in the background.  F: Light bodied with high carbonation. Once again I am reminded of champagne.,0.649802465424063,4.75,0.595
Society & Solitude #4,"Tasted on tap at Prohibition Pig. Bright and hazy. The aroma is mainly dank citra with earthy, floral, pungent undertones from the galaxy.

Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,A pounder can into a tumbler appears slightly darker than what a watered down version of jello vanilla pudding would look like if you poured it into a glass. It boasts a white cap that fades quick leaving a full curtain of lace.  The aroma is citrus fruits almost minty with pulpy and pithy fruit accent like oranges/grapefruit. It smells delicious.  The taste carries a lot of that minty hop feel with a hint of pine resinous cling lasting long into the aftertaste.  This is medium in body with modest carbonation. Its decent but possibly a dated can because it lacks any real hop punch to the nose especially for being double dry hopped.,0.6669904001710307,3.75,0.5927

Enjoy By IPA,"The beer poured a lovely shade of golden, with one a crystal clear body. The head was a little small, barely measuring at one finger thick. The aroma was very dank, smelling of grapefruit and pine resin. The taste was superlative. I was blown away by the assault of the dank piney and citric hops strong enough to strip teeth enamel. The hops were backed by simple pale malts that provided just a touch of sweetness. This was a sticky hop bomb, and coated my tongue, and throat going down, providing a long lingering hop aftertaste. The alcohol was well hidden, making this very drinkable despite the near double digit ABV. This is an essential beer if you are a hophead. I thought I had already reviewed it before now, but I was wrong about that. You can bet this is going to be a go to purchase for me from now on.  04.20.2016 edition, enjoyed on 04.09.2016",0.6469814904192823,5.0,0.5927

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Got to drink this at the second Firestone Walker invitational I believe. And then again in bottle at a March Madness event brought courtesy of leftpaw I believe.   Pours a used motor oil like color and consistency.

Taste is pretty nice, plenty of chocolate, sugar, brown sugar, molasses, roasted coffee notes from the malt. Mouth feel has an appropriately lower carbonation and hides the abv quite well. There is a substantial amount of bitterness here. Its significantly better than the base version by itself. Tends to have more of a boozy quality than it does a bourbon taste. Really good stuff, but with so many bourbon barrel stouts out there, I have no idea why people pay/trade so high for it.",0.6438545600940913,4.25,0.5917
Chocolate Rain,"A - Black. No head no lace. Nada.  S - Soy sauce, booze, hoppy , very very HOT.  T - Backed goods, sweet malts, soy sauce and a little hoppy bite.

Lou Pepe - Framboise,2009 Vintage  A: The body is ruby pink with a light pink lacy head.  S: Sweaty estery aroma with sour raspberries.  T: Light fruity flavors of raspberries and strawberries. There is a pleasent tart and sour apple running through the entire flavor of this beer.  M: A little light but that was expected for this style of beer. Very high carbonation.  O: Amazing beer. Worth getting.,0.6460261292679554,4.5,0.5911
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is okay. Aroma is bourbon, char, and oak out right, but is quickly followed by roasty, toasty malts. Caramel, molasses, and toffee add a little sugary complexity and depth, with herbal and resiny hops rounding out the aroma. Flavor profile is deep, dark and balanced, hitting notes of bourbon, char, oak, toffee, caramel, chocolate and molasses with roasty and toasty malts underneath it all. Resiny and herbal hops add a little zest underneath the sugary and malt notes. Balance is solid, with bourbon adding complexity, but not heat. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a smooth, creamy texture. Overall, an incredible barrel aged stout that focuses on balance and simplicity. It doesn't taste like it has over 13.3% alcohol in it, instead it comes off smooth and easily drinkable.  Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle.",0.6982186120773554,4.5,0.5907
Scaled Up,"Look: Slightly hazy, soft orange-gold in color.   Aroma: Pine, faint melon.   Taste: sugary melon, lots of pine, some earthy tones and residual sugar. There's definitely some herbal notes going on that I wish weren't there, not that they're terrible.   Mouthfeel is fine, low carb but not deficient.   Overall - For Trillium this is just OK. But ignoring that it's Trillium, this is a fairly solid DIPA. However, but the value isn't great once I realized what I paid for it. It's roughly the same quality to me as a fresh can of Larry, but much, much more expensive so I'd likely never buy it again. When I get the chance to occasionally splurge and spend my hard earned money on Trillium, I expect much more given what I know they can do, so this left me disappointed overall even though the beer is solid.",0.6653461090657558,3.75,0.5907

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Thanks to joey and random guy in line for tastings of this. Black as night, no head. Aroma was heavy on the molasses and bourbon. Huge bourbon intro with chocolate, molasses, and alcohol. Finishes very boozy, syrupy. A bit over the top for me, not very drinkable. I had a 4 oz glass and it was a bit too much.

Haze,"Poured into a snifter. A turbid golden-yellow color with a frothy white head. The foam slowly settled into a nice firm cap.

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Poured at Pulling Nails b4 release. Pours black, with bourbon notes on the nose.

Sip Of Sunshine,"This is significantly overrated in my opinion. It smells nice and all but is not as pleasurable to drink as similar beers this highly ranked. The first sip is nice but flavors get muddled and it can't decide if it's going to end crisp or fruity hazy lingering and that holds it back.  There a lot of better things on the market these days especially at this premium price point.  If you look closely, lawson's is brewed by Two Roads, and that makes sense as it did feel like a variation of their Two Juicy or Road to Ruin.

Floral and tropical fruit aromas. Taste mirrors this, moderate amount of hops for the style, there are certainly more aggressively hopped IPAs. A delayed malt character presents itself to balance out the finish. Thick, lacy mouthfeel, can feel and taste this beer for about 20 minutes after finishing it.",0.6971408099687031,4.25,0.5734
Caffè Americano,Pumped to find this for 6 bucks at a giant eagle on the way to a concert. Color on fleek deep dark toxic black thick and viscous with a 1/2 inch of froth. Smell is pretty good black roast coffee deep espresso and can't really pick anything else. Taste is a tough but as it warms mocha and coffee become more refined. Body is heavy of course and abv is a bit harsh.

I'm one of the craft beer fanboys that do take my ostrich head out of the ground to develop a sense for styles that are not IPAs or ""citrusy juicy bomb beers"". My bad. If you're not annoyed already please read on.  This reminds me of a Samuel Smith Organic Chocolate stout. No hint of coffee or espresso or single origin coffee on this rascal. It's a hunk of milk chocolate goodness. From start to finish it's an onslaught of chocolate overload. And that's a good thing. The mouthfeel for a sub 7pct chocolate stout is on point.

Haze,"Canned 10/30/18 ""NO TV AND NO BEER MAKE HOMER GO HAZY""  Picked up a few cans at the brewery in early November. This one is definitely more bitter than expected, though it's still wayyyy below your average DIPA bitterness. Heavy on the grapefruit and melon, it's juicy yet pungent. Absurdly drinkable. TH beers become more discernibly different when you go back to back in the same style category. Today, for my second go-around with my haul from my first visit to the brewery (picked up 2 cans of each style I hadn't tried, which equaled 12 cans total...suck it beer nerds with their dolly stacked with cases), I was lucky enough to drink a Curiosity 54 followed by Treat which was then followed by Haze.

Space Trace,"On tap at the Bottle Logic tasting room on 10/24/16.  I'll preface my review by stating that I do not like coconut.

Green,"A: The beer is cloudy light yellow in color. It poured with a finger high white head that gradually died down, leaving a short head covering the surface and lacing around the edges of the glass. S: Moderate aromas of grapefruit and tangerine citrus are present in the nose. The grapefruit dissipates as the beer warms up and becomes replaced with hints of limes and mangos. T: The taste has flavors of orange citrus along with hints of mangos and pineapples. There is a moderate amount of bitterness. M: It feels medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation. A light amount of crispness becomes perceptible once the beer begins to warm up. O: This beer packs in as much hop aromas and flavors you would expect from a hoppy Imperial IPA but isn't too heavy on the palate and has an easier drinkability that closer resembles that of an IPA. No alcohol is perceptible. I found it interesting how both the aromas and flavors changed around as the beer warmed up.  Note: Canned on 5/1/18  Serving type: can",0.6864767911104831,4.75,0.5525
Sure Bet,"Reviewed from notes.  Looks like straight up puree. Very hazy. If you don't like pulp in your orange juice then this isn't for you.  Smell has a huge dose of mango, mixed in with very present alcohol. Peppery spice there too.  Taste has an extremely astringent, bitter, pithy taste. Tropical fruit is masked by some alcohol. The bitterness masks almost all other flavors. The more sips I have the better it gets, but not that much. The fruit aroma tends to take over and the beer settles down a bit.  Feel is odd. The puree floats over your tongue and you can almost feel the little bits of mango.  Overall a decent beer. The astringent flavor will prevent me from seeking this one out though. I have found the same thing to be true with all of the Pipeworks IPAs I try. They all seem to have this astringent taste to me. I wonder if it is just the yeast that they use.",0.6730787070628351,3.5,0.5515
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"This is truly an amazingly crafted beer. Made by the oldest brewery in the world that dates back to 1040 in Bavaria. This is an outstanding piece of craftsmanship and a damn good hefewiesen/hefeweissbeir. It pours cloudy with a nice/decent head. Its colour is a hazy sun color. The smell is of wheat, orange, and lemon. The taste is grains,sweet but not overpowered citrus, and almost a hint of nut and overtones of banana.

Aroma is like sticking your nose into a bag of pelletized hops that have been open awhile. Herbal, citrusy and with a hefty cheese-like stank to it.  Taste is like lemony drop candy with a cereal-like grain freshness/sweetness to the finish. Some of that cheese-like hop flavor is present before finishing with lemon pledge cleaner.  Medium in body with modest carbonation. Not a bad brew.",0.6487672995104827,3.75,0.5499
Coconut B-Bomb,"2018 release. A month or two old.   A: Pours an impenetrably dark brown with a cap of dark brown head that dissipates quickly to thick ring. Decent retention for the minimal head that’s there, and no lacing.  S: Dry cocoa powder, sweet toasted coconut, medium-light bourbon with a bit of alcohol burn, a touch of vanilla bean, and a hint of dried cherry.   T: Cocoa powder, loads of rounded bourbon, a bit of ethanol, vanilla, and a good amount of toasted coconut. Medium-light sweetness hits the spot. Not super complex.  M: Medium-full body with medium, sharp carbonation. Smooth, moderate alcohol warmth.   O: The coconut aspect is great, but it mostly masks the fruit/leather/toffee flavors of the base beer.",0.6691674595308739,4.25,0.549
Swish,"Picked up a the BBHQ on 12/4 (with about 200 others in line). The beer had been recommended to me and did not disappoint. The coloration is light orange and magnificent and the taste is both tremendous and unique. Extremely smooth and no trace of the 8%. Hops and a hint of fruit flavor that strikes me a grapefruit. I'd doesn't taste like HT or SOS but I'd put it right up there with them, if not above. Everyone I've shared a can with has been blown away.

M: Thin body for a big Imperial Stout, low carbonation, and whatever superlative you'd care to apply to the alcohol presence.  O: First of all, this was good. There's an awful lot of barrel character and booze, to the point that even if the ABV wasn't so high, I wouldn't want to drink it all the time. My biggest complaint was the body. Perhaps I'm spoiled by the amazing mouthfeel of Cigar City's stouts, but this really fell short in that department. Very good, but not quite great.",0.6362225136649972,4.25,0.528

The nose is complex cherry, and the taste follows, with black and red cherry, plum, grape, balsamic vinegar, and light caramel. The taste is pretty sour (7+/10), especially when chilled, but it opens up as it warms. Big cherry flavor. Subtle bourbon and vanilla.  The mouthfeel is slick but smooth. Borderline teeth-achingly sour until your palate adjusts, but reigned in by the barreling.  Overall, 9+/ 10. A wide range of cherry and dark fruit flavors, masked a bit initially by sour lemon that drops off and morphs as it approaches room temperature.

Todd The Axe Man,"Quick 12oz pour in a snifter, had on tap.  A: Bartender poured to the brim, so there was little to no head present. Decidedly orange in color with only a very mild haze.  S: Smells of citrus- mostly tangerine wedges and orange peel. Mango and apricot, soft earthy tones too. Toasty malt backbone.  T: Follows the nose. Mostly citrus notes of orange and tangerine, backed by mango and apricot. Soft earth and pine, moderate bitterness. Malt backbone of toast and biscuit provides a solid anchor. Dries into the finish.  M: Medium body, well textured with a slight heft. Prickling carbonation.  O: Reminds me somewhat of the prototypical NE IPAs, before the style developed into what it is now. It's a far cry from the haze bomb, no boil hop/all dry hop beers that have now come to define the style. It still has a West Coast sensibility about it. In fact, there are elements of it that remind me of the likes of Sculpin and Racer 5. It's a great beer, but I have to say I'm a bit surprised it's getting the amount of uber-geek hype that it is. The Insufferables here in the Northeast have long abandoned anything resembling west coast IPA and have even started to bash benchmarks like Lawson's for not being hazy and juicy enough.

Enjoy By IPA,pours light orange with one finger head. nose is nice orange and tangerine. medium carbonation. I get some orange rind mid to late pallate with nice bitter finish. juicy at the end of the sip making my cheeks pucker. nice beer with nothing overpowering. better than some but I wouldn't place it in the top tier of iipas.,0.6324780430869922,4.0,0.5101
Flora - Blueberry,"bottle shared on 8/26/14  One of the most beautiful beers I've poured. Overall, thought the beer could use some more carbonation and some more souring, but that's just me. The blueberry flavor was a homerun, but having this after BB Flanders left me wanting more acidity and funk to this beer.",0.5857661271392186,4.5,0.51
Darkstar November,"Bourbon was way too strong at this point. Let this big boy settle down before you drink it. at least a year. Big flavors with moderate carbonation.  I taste malt, caramel, a slight hint of vanilla and chocolate. Very sweet. I see the potential, but its just not right as of yet.",0.626175489210482,4.0,0.51
Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"One of the best maple beers I've had. Barrel and bourbon comes through very well, but the maple on the nose and the tongue is really the star of the show.",0.5226211521055383,4.5,0.51
Peche 'n Brett,"Pours murky orange with two finger head. Nose was amazing! Major notes of peach almost like peach ring candy. Taste was lacking hints of peach, lightly tart, majorly farmhouse style expected from Logsdon. Very drinkable but does not live up to the hype.",0.6363286709925975,4.0,0.5099
Todd The Axe Man,"Pours hazy, orange in color with 1/4 inch head. Taste is grapefruit, mango, and a touch of pine and orange. Bitter, medium-heavy bodied with moderate carbonation. One of the better Surly beers I have had. Really good IPA...Glad I picked up a four pack...Will get this again.",0.6394480197728478,4.25,0.5095
Madagascar,"Served in a tulip, I believe it was a 2015 bottle because I picked it up on a trade in Jan 2016. Distinct vanilla aroma as poured out of the bottle. Very sweet, molasses and/or prune flavor, w vanilla. Didn't taste much bourbon on the front end. For the price, I could drink this once a week forever.",0.5723323421344548,4.5,0.5095
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Reviewed courtesy of schen9303. 2006 vintage poured from a corked wine bottle into a Ithaca tulip.   A: Standard pour reveals a 1.5 finger creamy, powdery colored pastel pink head with moderate retention. Beer is a semi-cloudy red rose. No lacing whatsoever.   S: Woody skunk and sourness. Sour red fruit in the beginning is barely detectable.   T: First sip is sooo bitingly sour. Subsequent tastes reveal a woody, moldy skunk character along with sour raspberries. Flavor is very deep and overwhelming. This beer really doesn't finish in any way. The sour character lingers on and on and on making every other sip more intense than the last.   M: Medium bodied that borders on full. Mouth is slightly carbonated and very smooth. Finish is messy and lingers forever. I can't tell if this beer is thick from the body or from my mouth watering from the flavor.   D: Not drinkable in the traditional sense as the flavors here are again... overwhelming. However, enjoyable and quite complex. Every bit worth seeking out and sampling.",0.6865755126660259,4.0,0.5095
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Hazy yellow body with a half inch of white head. Aromas of canteloupe, assorted melons, grapefruit, tart citrus. The flavor is more of the same. Sweet and tart melon. Hop forward and juicy. Dank and resinous. Tasty!",0.6111401137660821,4.5,0.5093
Vicinity,"This is a decent double IPA from Trillium, but not the best. It has the look of all of their lightly hazy doubles, and it is a decent beer. The smell to me is like ocean water, but I can't tell if thats because there's oysters on the label or if its reality! It taste decent, its hoppy and tangy, maybe tangerine. Mouthfeel is pretty standard, fairly dry finish. Overall a decent double, but I would take uppercase over it anyway. not to mention a few other of their DDH streets.",0.6863798839019023,4.0,0.509
Green,"2 week old can. Hazy orange mud water. Looks cloudy and quite unappealing. Smells like dank and citrus. Taste follows. Some dominant citrus notes and a light bready backbone. Nothing exceptional. All hype...not a bad beer, but nothing like the stuff coming out of HF and Trillium taste-wise.",0.6525307892948,3.75,0.5069

Beer:Barrel:Time,"I honestly didn't love this beer as much as I had expected. While the appearance and mouthfeel were fantastic, I thought the beer itself tasted overly smokey. It was certainly a beer worth trying, but I'd never advise someone to chase it given what it fetches on the secondary market. Proceed with caution.",0.5874033692371428,4.5,0.505
Chocolate Rain,"L: opaque blackish brown with mocha lacing. S: vanilla, cacao nibs, roasted malts, fruity coffee. T: vanilla and cacao dominate, fruity and bright coffee; implied sweetness from the vanilla and cacao; vanilla and oaky bourbon finish. F: on the lighter side of heavy. Not syrupy or oily. Warm finish from the bourbon barrels and alcohol; not otherwise hot. Excellent! Big fan of vanilla and cacao blend.",0.6072757859754326,4.75,0.5042
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Bottled in 2010, April 28  Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy plum color with pink highlights; not much head to show for the effort but it does leave some dots on the glass  Smell: Cherries, lemons and oak, with lactic sour tones and barnyard funk  Taste: Puckeringly tart, right off the bat, with developing undertones of cherry, oak, grape, lemon that arrive in the middle; the barnyard funk is powerful and builds, after the swallow, producing a bone dry, tart, oaky finish  Mouthfeel: Light to medium body with low to moderate carbonation; puckery  Overall: No sweetness in this Kriek and not for the inexperienced; quite an extraordinary beer",0.6867791257625864,4.0,0.5023
Green,"In my very humble opinion, the best beer produced by this excellent facility. I have had many of the others, but here is perfection in a glass. Piney, resinous, tropical fruit.

Sip Of Sunshine,"As much as it looks and smells delicious, it never satisfies my expectations of pure taste.

Chocolate Rain,"2013 version poured into a snifter. A nearly opaque deep brown color. A thin and fleeting tan head formed on the pour, leaving behind some wispy laces. The nose was full of cocoa, vanilla, wood, coffee, and cherries. The taste did not disappoint: rich chocolate with fleeting whiskey, vanilla, cherry, and coffee notes. A full and creamy mouthfeel with a slight stickiness on the finish. Also a comfortable warming on the end. Mostly chocolate here - look forward to comparing newer bottles.",0.6314847024337993,4.25,0.4997
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"L: Golden honeycomb hues with a thin white head S: Lemons, hay, slight mineral component, and a balanced funk T: Even keeled citrus profile - grapefruit, lime, and lemon pith - complemented by a soft white wine note, oak, and that classic HF-style finish F: Effortlessly soft and crisp mouthfeel O: Another incredible saison from Hill Farmstead. Nicely complex profile with citrus, wine, oak, and a slight funk. Awesome.",0.7219311860829948,4.75,0.4997
Swish,"Canned a week and a half ago.   A: Pours an opaque light golden with two fingers of white pillowy head which slowly deflates leaving streaks of lacing. Good retention.  S: Green, grassy raw hops dominate the nose, though some of this burns off after a few minutes. Afterward, there’s a good dose of apricot and floral/grassy notes and a touch of grainy malt.   T: Light apricot and peach, and fairly strong floral notes, light graininess and wheat, finishing with a soft bitterness and mild sweetness on a longish finish.   M: Soft, creamy mouthfeel with medium body and medium carbonation.  O: Solid NE IPA, quite drinkable with some bitterness for balance. The hop character leans more towards floral and grassy, which isn’t quite my cup of tea for this style of beer.",0.7035805326439557,4.25,0.4997
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Served in a Gale Sayers shaker pint glass.  Popped this cork to celebrate my recent promotion. Here's hoping it was worth the considerable investment. It pours a cloudy tawny-rose topped by a few fingers of pink-tinted white foam. The nose comprises tart cherry, light cobweb, vanilla, light caramel (very akin to caramel corn), dank oak, lactic acid, lemon zest, and a twist of ruby red grapefruit. The taste brings in more of the same, though the lactic acid and sour citrus notes seem to cloud the cherries out a bit. A touch of white wine vinegar is tossed into the mix as well, just to liven things up a bit. It's surprising that the tartness isn't more powerful, especially considering the effect it had on the back of my teeth. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a dry, rather sticky finish. Overall, a very nice lambic, though it's hard to really enjoy it for an extended period of time (without experiencing some negative side effect of the sourness). Though I feel the cherries were talked-up a bit too much, I'd gladly take another glass, but I doubt I'd shell out the $35+ for it very often in the future.",0.6603659869494285,4.0,0.4971
Scaled Up,"Canned 02/07/17, so two weeks ago.  A: An opaque orange juice color with a bit of off white head that fizzles out to basically nothing. No lacing, no retention.   S: Ripe mango, creamy tangerine, candy lifesavers. Kind of a galaxy/mosaic thing going on.   T: Orange with a decent amount of citrus bite, a bit of tropical fruit (mango), finishing with soft bitterness and sweetness. There’s also some yeast-derived astringency/grittiness on the finish. Not quite as flavorful as I’ve come to expect from Trillium.  M: Medium-full body, creamy texture, with a sharp medium-light carbonation that cuts through the body. A bit of alcohol taste and warmth.  O: Better nose than taste, this is middle of the road for Trillium IPAs.",0.694055050111537,4.25,0.4956
Oude Geuze Vintage,"750 ml bottled in 2006.  A: Murky red/brownish color, very little carbonation.  S: Very funky. Musty smells, a bit of lemon.  T: Must, lemons, apples, wheat, oak. Tastes better than the smell.  M: Medium body, I would've like more carbonation though.  O: Great gueuze, I haven't tried many but this one was almost at the top of what I've tried (probably second only to Lente).",0.6191051025657116,4.5,0.494

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"On draft at Dark Lord Day 2010 - Pours jet black with a thin wispy, chocolate head. Aroma is complex- vanilla and bourbon dominate with mollasses, chocolate, and soy sauce. Taste is similar - mollasses, chocolate, bourbon, coffee, and alcohol, Mouthfeel is both oily and creamy. My favorite imperial stout.",0.5858230520012648,3.5,0.4939
Enjoy By IPA,"An easy pour from a 12-oz. can is all it takes for a finger of pure white froth with some large bubbles, long retention and sliding ridges of lace. Golden straw color, slightly hazy. The smell(as well as the taste) features citrus and piney hops with rich crackery malt and alcohol in the the background. The taste has added orange(and other citrus) peel plus unripe honeydew melon The taste at first is neutral on sweetness and moderately bitter,this builds to a dry finish with high bitterness that lingers a while. Medium-light body, + average carbonation. Boozy yet sort of smooth, full bitterness and some spice. I arrived a little late to the party(7/4/19) but its still a very drinkable DIPA.

Nelson,"This rye IPA is a pale gold, effervescent beer that straddles the no-man's-land between hazy and cloudy; a brief-lived, medium pebbly off-white head leaves good, somewhat complex bands of lacing. The nose is moderate in intensity: pineapple juice, pine, sweet florals and more subdued citrus notes with slight alcohol overtones and a hint of body odor. Up front, the palate presents as bitter pineapple, pine/floral soapiness and a nutty bittersweetness. By mid-palate, the citrus character shows a bit, as does the body odor from the nose; the bitterness builds to a medium-strong level, offset a bit by a modest bready malt presence (I don't really pick up any rye character). The finish is balanced and closes out with a decent carbonation bite, followed by the onset of a nice strong resinous hop bitterness that lingers quite awhile. Mouthfeel is big for the medium body, and the texture is slightly creamy and moderately peppery from the fizzy-yet-restrained carbonation. (22 oz bottle, 98 days before best-by)",0.7228570014306956,4.0,0.4939
Beatification,"Straw with a hint of haze, moderate to few large, fast rising bubbles, and a fast dissipating white foam.  Smells really funky, sour, lambic like with oak notes and dusty cellars. Reminds me of Cantillon brewery in Brussels. Some white wine, and yellow stone fruit.  Sour with no sweetness, macaroni, oak notes, sour yellow plums, lemon juice, gravel, and dusty cellar. A hint of dull bitterness as well.  Medium, sour, acidic body with moderate to low carbonation. Tart, dry finish.  I got this in Santa Rosa at Russian River's original brewhouse, and am drinking it in Redding, Feb 4th, 2018. Excellent brew!",0.6419703213641005,4.25,0.4937
Green,"Pours a hazy orange in color with a finger of white head, very reminiscent of orange juice. Aroma is very tropical with lots of pineapple, some citrus, and mango. The taste is straight juice and is heavy on the tropical fruits; mango, papaya, pineapple, tangerine, and peach. Medium-light body and moderate carbonation yield a pillowy mouthfeel. Overall a good beer and an excellent representation of a New England style IPA but I just wasn't feeling it.",0.6759980005422005,4.0,0.4931
Haze,"Hazy NE IPA golden color. Foamy head that quickly disappears. Juicy explosions at first pour. Smooth taste, little after taste, not too hoppy. Good mouth feel, some creaminess yet too much lingering feel. Overall great offering from TH, easy to drink everyday.",0.6630141205462703,4.5,0.4929

Coolship Red,"375 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Bottled March 20, 2014.  Appearance - Pours a hazy pink. Small white head. Settles quickly to nothing.  Smell - Awesome. Oak. Lemony acidity. Lots of acidic raspberry. Lightly funky.  Taste - Super oaky. Lemon sourness. Raspberry starts tame and gets extremely sour. Even gets a little acetic. Very intense.  Mouthfeel - Medium body. Intense sourness makes it less crisp. Well carbonated.   Overall - It's delicious, but I think it's too sour.",0.688193667917632,4.0,0.4902

Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"The beer pours a light straw colored yellow that's clouded with copious amounts of hazy particulates and topped by a thin, white head that fades without lacing. The nose is ripe with funk and notes of stone fruit + hay as it warms. It drinks with a taste that mirrors the nose - teeming with colonies of yeast and bacteria, rustic grain, tart white peach, a slight tannic bitterness, and a hint of cleansing booze in the finish. As predicted, this is a crushable saison that brings the funk without being unpleasant, and has gushing fruits and grain that linger on the palate slowly sucking my mouth dry of its saliva. This is a very impressive beer and there would be no doubt/hesitation about trying it again...and again.",0.6438138881629879,4.5,0.4848

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"The '09 was, in my opinion, a step down from the regular Dark Lord and two steps down from Vanilla Bean Dark Lord. This seem the least polished of the three. The nose was hotter, the mouthfeel had lost some of the rich creaminess in exchange for a bitter wood tannin, and just did not leave a great impression. Still a solid beer that most breweries would sell their soul to produce, but for the perfection that is expected with Three Floyds it was good, but not great.",0.6648744791207194,4.0,0.4772

Aroma is coffee, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, caramel and roast. Layers of different types of coffee.  Taste is layers and layers of espresso, dark roasted coffee, bourbon, dark/milk chocolate, vanilla and caramel. Bit of oak dryness and roasted malt notes too. Very complex with different notes being highlighted with each sip.  Body is lighter side of full and the mouthfeel is creamy. ABV is VERY well hidden and dangerously makes for a drinkable beer.

A brief glance at the label and you'll know (at 19.7%) this isn't something to take lightly. This beer doesn't have a color, it's strictly the absence of all light.   S-Huge alcohol up front, almost as if smelling a spirit. Bourbon is slightly there, but is overpowered by the alcohol content of the beer itself.   T-Husky up front. Lost of malt in here. Hard to pick out a dominant flavor. The bourbon/malt/alcohol is very complex.   F-Lots of alcohol means this one is a sipper.   O-Share with friends.",0.6110009921162459,4.5,0.4767

Scaled Up,"Poured from a 750ml bottle. Poured the hazy yellow orange color into my glass. The nose had lots of citrus fruit aromas orange seems to be the strongest. The taste is also of citrus with many other tropical fruits in the mix here mango, papaya with a slight hint of bitterness from the hops in the very back of your mouth. Another good DIPA from Trillium.",0.6224828620491945,4.5,0.4767

Chocolate Rain,"What a fantastic beer that I was able to try after Thanksgiving dinner. I have had Black Tuesday and although I can't say for sure since I didn't have them side by side, I think I like this one better. I think the addition of cacoa nibs and vanilla beans actually adds a nice element to the beer.

S - Verty sweet soft aroma with hints of milk chocolate, very pronounced.  T - Red wine flavours up front followed by some hot sweetness. The bourbon flavours are soft but present, the finish is boozy and sweet.   M - Thick full body. with minimal carbonation.  O - A massive Imperial Stout. everything about this says overload.

Plenty of cherry, lemon, strawberry seeds, wood, vinegar. There is a lot of acetobacter. Quite dry. Very well balanced and enjoyable. Long tart finish. A touch of astringency, very fine carbonation, maybe a little too much so it's kind of distracting. A good beer, but not quite as good as I was expecting.

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Sampled at DLD '10. Pours just as black and thick and oily as Dark Lord ever does. The aroma is massively boozy chocolate, dark fruits, and coffee just like regular Dark Lord but with a very oaky/woody overtone. It's not like the typical oak aroma from most bourbon barrel beers. It has sort of a green/fresh woody quality to it. The flavor is also again dominated by massive waves of chocolate, molasses, dark fruit, and coffee. Again though, like the aroma, the oak comes off as sort of harsh and green. The regular '10 Dark Lord seemed a bit smoother and more balanced.",0.6685703101988327,4.0,0.4516
Madagascar,"This beer was a let down. I went to the brewery in Missouri and was so excited for the ""copius"" amounts of Vanilla. The flavor did not come through. This beer should not be on the top 500 let alone 200",0.5020185121387668,3.75,0.4435
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),On tap at DLD for 9 bucks a snifter. Pretty steep.  Dark black liquid with no head. Anyone who rates a beer like this as a 5 in appearance is an idiot. The smell is potent booze. If you close your eyes you might think you're smelling a glass of bourbon. Not a plus for a beer. The bourbon should complement but not dominate. The flavor is all booze and caramel. It's almost like the beer itself is completely gone. They could have just barrel aged miller light and with this level of alcohol it would taste the same. Not worth the wait or the price.,0.5978907838036616,2.5,0.4416

Effervescence spews wildly from the bottom with each sip or disturbance of the glass. There is a nice pillowy surface cap left behind. Aroma is wheat malt, banana, orange, yeast & coriander with lemon hints. Taste is bready wheat malt, banana & some clove to give a hint of bubblegum, dry, lightly biting bitter finish. Aftertaste is gelatinous, dry wheat & yeast. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with moderate-high carbonation, tongue clinging, soapy, chewy & very dry.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Had this on tap at the 12-15-18 release in Decorah. The aroma on this was amazing and was a step above the flavor.

Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"L - looks thin coming out of the bottle. Not seeing much head so I poured it a little harder and got fizzy cola bubbles. Actually erupted like a freshly poured glass of coke with hundreds of tiny bubbles screaming their way to the top. No, it didn't overflow, all this action was taking place over the width of maybe 5mm. Definite legs when swirling, but it just looks so thin. Too thin for this ABV!  S - woof. Bourbon city! Vanilla and whiskey. Hints of dark chocolate and maybe a tiny bit of pepper heat. Could just be the alcohol though!   T - not gonna lie, this is mostly whiskey. Not a whole lot of beer going on, nevermind maple! Dry rye sucks the moisture out of this beast as the barrel tangles with flavors of oak and burnt wheat. Very woodsy and I'm getting the faintest burnt molasses or brown sugar note. Is this the maple? Could it possibly be?   F - it's thin, but in the same way whiskey is thin. This is whiskey. Silky and smooth, but not a lot of body. I mean, it is a porter, not necessarily a stout so maybe I should be looking at it differently. But it's still 11% for chrissakes.   O - I like the flavor of whiskey so I like this beer. Not sure it's all its cracked up to be and it comes off as rather one dimensional.",0.6032306162060893,4.0,0.4325
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Can dated 03/08/17 - Purchased at the Canton location - Poured into an English pub glass  L - Pours a super hazy golden straw color, reminiscent of a mimosa. Little to no head on a mildly aggressive pour, delicate lacing that seems to fade off.  S - Mango, peach and bready malt up front. Slight lime/citrus makes its presence known but isn't a front runner.   T - Grapefruit, citrus zest, a hint of pine that I didn't catch in the nose, faint spice and a solid malt backbone. A little lingering bitterness / pine as you finish the pint.  F - Medium bodied, lightly carbonated.  O - Certainly close to the epitome of a NE IPA, not quite a juice bomb but seriously in the upper echelon of all IPAs... The only complaint I have about this beer is the price. I get it, you're Trillium, but the premiumization on the price of this beer is insane. I couldn't even get a full mixed case for less than $100. I've had equal or better brews for less money from other MA brewers.",0.6512081874745819,4.75,0.4325
Mastermind,"Light colored double IPA that looks almost like a pale ale. Great citrus/juicy flavors, but not your typical NE hop bomb that is so common among highly rated NE IPAs and DIPAs.

Double Orange Starfish,"Pours an opaque ripe-orange with a hint of light turning the edges an opaque white. Head is a finger in height (half pour from can) with good retention. Aroma is orange, grapefruit, resiny hops and biscuity, yeasty malts. Orange is jam like, but smooth and a little less residual sugar. Aroma has a little green bite to it at the finish along with a little alcohol when swirled. Flavor profile is orange, papaya, tangerine and raw grain, peanut and biscuity malts and yeast at the finish. Hop notes are solid, but not in the face, setting up a very controlled presence. Alcohol is absent from the flavor profile. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a smooth - almost still - consistency that opens up to a lightly silty grain at the finish. In other words, texture is akin to a lightly rindy orange juice. Overall, hops are solid and mingle well with the malts, although the hops steal the show. It's getting a little higher in ABV, but the alcohol still remains absent in the flavor profile despite making a brief appearance in the aroma.

Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,"On tap from the release and out of a bottle from the release, this beer is simply boozy liquid brownie.

This very slowly transitions into some grassy notes with low-moderate bitterness. Finishes with lingering citrus and grassy notes  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth  O: A super drinkable DIPA that verges on juice bomb, with just enough grassy and floral notes to keep it out of that realm. Definitely worth tracking down",0.6778042469612404,4.75,0.428

Sure Bet,"A: The beer is quite hazy yellow in color—too hazy to see if there is any visible carbonation. It poured with a quarter finger high white head that quickly settled down, leaving a narrow collar around the edge of the glass and some lacing down the sides. S: Moderate aromas of mangos are present in the nose along with notes of orange citrus. T: The taste follows the smell, having flavors of mangos and orange citrus along hints of candi sugar (somewhat like what you would expect in a Belgian tripel) There is a light to moderate amount of bitterness. There are hints of alcohol in the finish. M: It feels a bit more than medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation. O: I really enjoyed the combination of mango and oranges in the smell and taste of this IPA.

Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Bottled 2/18/2018 consumed 2/16/2019   Poured into a Hill Farmstead etched glass  L - pours a golden hay color with a 1.5 inch almost white head that dissapates into a nice lace. Not as crisp of color as I expect from some of HF ba saisons  S - lime rind hits the nose first followed by green apple. As it warms start to get a hay/barnyard aroma and the oak comes though nicely. Additionally the hop sent develops as it sits. With a deep breath can get hits of ethenol.  T - it has been some time since I have drank regular Dorothy, but remember it not being my favorite due to the bitterness. Initially get hop bitterness on the tip of the tounge. This is followed by a fantastic light barnyard funk. Finishes with citrus and citrus rind bitterness and the oak does start to come through the more I consume. Very slight acidity. I do get minerality.  F - absolutely plays on the tounge. Light, effervescent and does not coat the tounge at all.  O - for being the easiest of the ancestry series, I think I could try to get more bottles. It is very complex and unlike the non BA version I enjoy the bitterness immensely",0.6549694324873826,4.75,0.4252
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,I had high expectations but this beer really disappointed. There was a flavor that I still can't put my finger on but was definitely a little off.

Haze,"This is quite possibly the most vile, putrid, and over-hyped beer I have ever consumed. It smells of a sun-baked, two week overdue litter box and tastes like a combination of mango, papaya, and guava juice mixed with alley cat urine. I suspect the carefully selected hop mixture has a neurotoxic effect on the brain that forces formerly astute beer drinkers to stand in line for hours awaiting their Great Depression era rations of this sludge. Chemical engineering and marketing genius. Looks like beer. Feel is tough to judge because it is forcefully ejected from my mouth before I have much time to ponder the oral sensation of this prized brew.

Definite one-note aroma of piney hop, not much in the way of fruit. Taste is hops and softened with the rye and malt. This is a good solid West Coast IPA, but doesn't quite live up to the lofty score. Has the beer changed in ten years? That's possible.

Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,"A: Thick black pour with elusive mocha-brown highlights, and a head with minimal characteristics: formation, retention, lacing  S: Molasses, liquorice, bourbon-drenched dark fruit concentrations with a vinous touch: An aroma of depth given the array of milk chocolate, oaked nutty malts, cocoa powder, caramel swirl, burned char, leather, subdued coconut   T: Lots of minute workings to become deep-rooted in: the silky sharp chocolate, tricky layers of dark fruit, smoky tobacco, rich caramel, singed toffee, roasted walnuts, baked vanilla espresso, a touch of maple fudge  M: Moderately sticky and semi cloying with distant carbonation. It’s fairly roast-y and sweet with a delicate peppery kick  O: A well balanced and blended vintage that aged with poise spitting out more prunes, raisins, dates, and figs as it progressed with a bit of tannin spiced/peppery herbs, ashtray/charred wood, and hints of brownie stuffed graham crackers.

S: Heavy barnyard character, fairly rich Vienna-like toast and slightly sweet malt and light citrus hops. Mild Sauvignon Blanc-like wine and candied gooseberry which suggest Nelson hops.   T: Moderate citrus, fairly intense earth/dirt with light astringency, finishing with a bit of white wine, but also moderate bitterness and more earth. Slightly mouthwatering but no tartness per se. A little austere for my taste.   M: Medium-light body and carbonation with slight creaminess.   O: Beautiful nose, much of which seems to be the hops and/or wine barrel. The bitterness and aggressive brett combine to make this a bit too dry without sufficient presence for my taste.",0.7037930855754131,4.25,0.4056
Space Trace,"Poured from a 16oz bottle into a Bottle Logic snifter. Acquired in a trade.

On the tongue is rich coconut macaroon, bakers chocolate, vanilla, fudgy brownies, bourbon, but not too sweet at all. I almost feel like I can taste the coconut husk here.. the coconut is very authentic, not overly sweet at all. Lightly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is decadent and rich, fudgy.

Some building lactic tartness in the back. Leather, oak, cherry flesh, pits, and some tiny hints of cherry juice. So much tart aggression. Mild funkiness brings some grass and hay, but it's minimal.  Mouthfeel: Screamingly tart and dry. Smooth moderately light body with minimal carbonation. So tart.  Overall: One of the more tart beers I've encountered.

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Was excited to try this and the pour into the glass looked awesome with 1 finger tan head. Smell was bourbon and chocolate, good mouthfeel and weight to the beer. The barrel presence is really good, vanilla notes and deep bourbon. The problem is the finish. It's almost metallic, or a chalky astringency. I let the beer warm up some to see if it mellowed but still something left at the end that frankly ruins the beer. Some might think it drinks hot, but the finish isn't alcohol burn, it's something else. It's a shame because everything else leading up to that is fantastic.",0.6183904645833408,3.5,0.3919

Todd The Axe Man,"Thanks to greenkrusty for swiping one of these from leftpaw/nachos. Another one of those Mosaic and Citra beers. All the rage, for good reason.  Pours a hearty orange color with 1/2"" slightly off white head. Aroma is pungent in its Mosaic and the Citra rounds things out behind it. Easy to see why its rated high from the aroma, it pops with that tropical mango all over it.  Taste, bigger beer, plenty hoppy, bitter, dank. The alcohol is also noticeable here unfortunately. I feel like a lower abv by 1% might have pushed this one to a much better score, because its pretty much the only downside to the beer. The ibu seems high, but its still plenty manageable.",0.6635467940417127,4.0,0.3919

Oude Geuze Vintage,"2012 version, at Lambik-o-droom. Slightly hazy dark golden color with creamy beige head. Aroma starts with hay, dry meadow flowers, unripe stonefruits and some lemon. Taste starts tart upfront with unripe fruits, but also with a fruit pits, seeds and skin bitterness. Hay and farmhouse notes throughout, funky but not too extreme. Light to medium body, dry, light to medium carbonation. A really well rounded gueuze, sour but quite easy to drink, funky but not cloying.",0.6770826137648851,4.5,0.3877
Space Trace,"From bottle. Pours black with a light brown head. Noticed a lot of little white coconut floaters as well. The nose was coconut heavy but I picked up just as much cacao if not a tad more. Maybe a hint of caramel but other than that I couldn't discern any hints of bourbon barrel aging. Same goes for the taste. A really, really well-integrated cacao/coconut blend that was not overly sweet nor did it hit you over the head with COCONUT. Again, any effect the barrels had on the flavor are well disguised in the margins.

Nelson,"I'm hoping I just got a bad bottle. It looked gorgeous in the glass, smelled like I was in for an awesome hop bomb, and then I tasted it and it was nothing but burnt malt. No citrus, no hops.

Second Fiddle,"Malt Bomb.....and one of the most overrated beers I've ever come across. If you are expecting a NE style hoppy brew, you will be sadly disappoined. Everything about it is par to sub par....oh, and did I say Malty? Thin for its weight, cloyingly sweet and slightly boozy. Picking up diacetyl, as well. This beer is oh so West Coast 2008.

The flavors are a bit light, but what they lack in intensity, they make up for in balance.

Beatification,"Reviewed as part of Blind BIF round 8  A: Pours a hazy golden color, with active bubbly carbonation.   S: Tart, citrusy, white wine. Lemon peel with a light earthy funk.   T: Mouth puckering sour. Sharp acidity, lemon juice, and white grapes. This is incredibly sour, but yet surprisingly drinkable.   M: Light, dry, tart with subtle but fizzy carbonation.   O: This might be the sourest beer I've ever had. It's still quite refreshing though. Another lovely sour brew to get me through these ridiculously 90+ temps.",0.672803889396884,4.25,0.3786
Sip Of Sunshine,"On the lighter side of golden , not hazy with a nice thick and shrinking white head. Citrus first, fruity behind nose. I’m sure at one time this was ground breaking stuff. Ok, the first thing that strikes me is the thickness and fullness of flavor. This puppy is more malty than I would have expected, more west coast in that respect. A bit more bitter than the New England styles I’m trying these days. The feel and lesser carbonation is spot on with this beer. Good stuff.",0.6480740538468993,4.25,0.3767

Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"From a bottle purchased at the brewery last weekend (so this was not an old or cellared stout) Beautiful black color, but almost no head and what little there was dissipated almost immediately. Visual lack of carbonation is problematic. Huge bourbon, molasses nose with hints of vanilla. Taste follows nose, but the fact that this bottle is flat really kills what would be an incredible experience. No need to go on and on - I obviously got a bad bottle. Flavor is so tasty that I am going to finish, so that should say something. Was a huge Jackie-Os stout fan after sampling Champion Ground and Oro Negro last week, but got rate 'em as I drink 'em. Happy that I have a second and hope that it doesn't have the same problem -may adjust my rating when I try it.  Bottom line - absolutely inexcusable to have quality control issues when you are charging 12 bucks for 12.7 ounces.",0.6122005987740197,3.5,0.3706

Green,"Meh. Considering just the beer itself compared to other similar this is OK but nothing special as to look, smell, taste or mouthfeel - just one of the crowd. However when you take into account the fact you have to drive to the middle of nowhere, stand in line 30 to 45 minutes and pay approx $4/can for it, it's ""value"" rating sinks far below 3.5. Just not worth it with all the interesting and well crafted beers out there available from your more local brewers, or retail or big box stores sometimes at a buck or three less per can.",0.5437722571987432,3.5,0.3675
Oude Geuze Vintage,"375mL bottle, 2008 vintage. Shared 3 ways and reviewed from notes.  Vigorous pop with corkage. Pours a heavily clouded apricot with a respectable white head that falls at a moderate pace to a collar.   Thick and meaty aromas of grapefruit pith and sour pineapple shaken up by a wild floral, herbal streak contributing big heather and dandelion notes. Hefty blue cheese contingent. Stonking nose.  Beefy green capsicum, brutally tart lemon and grapefruit pith, blue cheese, ground coriander and sage.  Thick, chewy, almost chalky texture with tingly carbonation doing little to mitigate the heft. Finishes with a very earthy tartness.  Aggressive and formidable gueuze. Not for the faint-hearted and very impressive.",0.6743690681988886,4.5,0.3673
Second Fiddle,"16 oz beer poured into a nonic pint glass canned on the 9/18.  A: Small tight white head that dissipates to a film. Body has good clarity with a deep gold amber color.  S: Lots of resiny hops but some slight sweet hints if grapefruit and pineapple.   T: is a lot if the nose with just a nice resiny Hop feel and some light fruitiness. This beer is juicy but it’s bitter too,.  M: Medium bodied leaning toward fuller with a crisp carbonation and clean finish.  O: I’m not disappointed with this beer at all. It is a resin Hop bomb with fruit undertones. This beer has just the right amount of bitterness.",0.6747795886542454,4.0,0.3643
Dragonsaddle,"Peach-orange puree, opaque as hell, almost darkening to tan, with a thin, dense white blanket leaving a fine film.  The aroma bouquet is a full on dank citra showcase, not even really identifiable as any single fruit, just a complete onslaught of fresh hops with a nice hint of pine needle and resiny but fresh green and non-stinging sap and a little white wine vinegar.  Taste is a peachy Orange Julius, with creamy grapefruit, pineapple and cannabis. It's tangy tastebud bombardment.  Dragonsaddle is bright and light on the palate with a pillowy froth and a dry finish.   ---  Revisiting via the next release in October 2017, it's clear they have consistency problems. This tastes much sweeter, and is a full on mango bubblegum bomb. I don't know what else to say, but the inability to come within the same flavor ballpark batch to batch is definitely a ding against it.",0.6723261560751385,4.25,0.3612

Coolship Red,"Pours reddish pink, smells vinous, raspberries, red wine vinegar. Taste is acidic, red wine vinegar like, a little burn from the acidity, some subtle oakiness. The one was bottled 2/2015, so it's still young, will let my second bottle age for awhile.",0.5756331624029672,4.5,0.3612

T - Strongly bitter flavor, with pith first, and a spicy malt hit from the rye, with flavors cycling out to the close.  M - Moderate carbonation, bright feel, mild drying on the close.  O - Glad I had a chance to pick up a growler from Jungle Jim's. It is a solid IPA, flavorful and drinkable. Quite bitter, but not overly so.",0.6814538370218568,4.25,0.3612

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2001 version, 750mL bottle with cork and cap, gifted by mikey711 in a BIF. There was a little syrupy red juice on top of the cork when I removed the cap, but after removing the cork I didn't see any other aging-related anomolies.  The beer is dark reddish-orange color, clear for the first few pours. Initially there was a big pink foam with large cell size but it disappeared quickly, leaving no bubbles at all. The aroma is strongly acidic with wild ale aromatics (barnyard, old leather) and lingering raspberry smells at the end of each sniff.   The first sip was WAY sour, I reflexively flinched and closed my eyes. Each subsequent sip was just as bracing but my palette was ready. There's no real sweetness to be found from the raspberries, just a faint raspberry taste along with the tart acidic bite and nearly salty after-taste. This doesn't sound good as I write it but it's kinda addictive, at least I keep sipping nearly continuously.  There's lots of carbonation, otherwise a light body similar to many other lambics. Not sure how much of the puckering tartness is due to age or the particular year it was made, so I'll be getting this again as a newer year sometime to try it again.",0.6430236524987754,3.5,0.3607
Black Tuesday,"2013 vintage poured into snifters at a cold temp and allowed to warm.

Vicinity,Took a beer run from northern NJ to Trillium with a quick stop at Treehouse on the way back. If you're from my area I highly recommend the trip - it was so worth it. This was another stunning brew from Trillium. Not much of an aroma but that's not as important to me as taste and feel which this brew has. Wonderfully smooth and drinkable. Its almost dangerous how easy this drinks with this high a ABV level. Not the best I've had but a stellar brew. Will def do another MASS beer run in the future.,0.6481702639388897,4.5,0.3603
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Jet black, tan head a few random gobs of lacing left behind. The smell is loaded with bourbon, oak, vanilla molasses, habaneros and chocolate.

Finishes with a nice little heat. This is a damn fine beer.",0.6019663639638818,4.5,0.3597
Chocolate Rain,"Pours brownish red. Thin looking and unimpressive for a stout of this stature.  Big fusle alcohol aromas almost burns my nose hairs. Thick chocolate, vanilla and toasty oak with a nice layer of bourbon. Some dark fruit lies underneath.  Just a killer tasting beer. Layers of sweet melted chocolate, fudge, vanilla bean, bourbon, dried fruits, burnt caramel, toasted oak, very light coffee. Date, black fig, quince and black licorice. Some cherry and currant as well.   Mouth isn't big and thick but oily and slick with alcohol. But fits the beer well and doesn't interfere.  Mmmmm!",0.6188841296756689,4.5,0.3595
Peche 'n Brett,L : Generic golden amber color. S: Strongest smell of a beer. Leaks out immediately after I open it. The peaches roam far. T: The union of peach and brett.

Enjoy By IPA,"Enjoy By 04-20-16  Long time fan of series. Sorry, but this latest batch was a let down. I wanted Devastatingly Dank, what I got was disappointingly dunce. However, still good. Just not nearly as good as previous editions, especially that last unfiltered masterwork they served up. That one was so good I didn't even want to drink it. I hated to see it go. This one is lacking in body, floral and smoothness. Maybe I was looking forward to it too much and it could not live up to my own hype. Left a coarse feel on palate and went down kind of grainy. Did not have that creamy feel to it that I've come to expect.  It cost me as I bought 2 six packs of it. I'll get around to drinking it. I had 4 Southern Tier 2XSMASH in fridge that put this Enjoy By to shame.  I drank that instead. I still will be there for the next batch but this one left me wanting. The beer just came off as nothing special, just an average DIPA. Hey I'm already over as the Great Lakes Chillwave has just dropped:)",0.5806188515846763,3.75,0.357

S: Aromas of mango, lemon, and peach complete with a graininess.  T: Lemon is definitely the predominant fruit, with a biscuity backbone. Fruity, grainy, but semi dry, with well calibrated bitterness.  M: Medium bodied with low carbonation. Leaves a tingling in the mouth.

Not wearing my glasses, and evening room light, meant it was a blind taste.  However, quite simply one of the most flavoursome and complex beers (the barrel effect was amazing) it has been my pleasure to drink.

M: Thick and syrupy mouthfeel with a dry cocoa finish. More alcohol flavors in the finish.  D: I realize drinkability and availability are different, but given the beer is only available 1 day a year for a 3 oz serving, I'm not sure how drinkable you can rate the beer.

Taste is full of seedy raspberry with a mild, balanced acidity that's woodier and a little funkier than Gambrinus.

The semi-dry finish brings up notes of toasty cracker and a little char, but overall LPF is really expressive of fruit without the added acid that often comes along with it.",0.7261646978471774,4.5,0.3499

Nice fluffy head is all can say for appearance as this was consumed at night out of a plastic cup. Hoppy nose hints at what is to come. Really actually pretty balanced once it hits the mouth with bitter hops up front kept in line with medium body malt goodness.

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Drank at Three Floyd's Brewing Company during the 2007 Dark Lord Day: Black as night it had a slight brown head that left some nice brown lacing. The nose was huge and filled with expresso, chocolate and porty overtones. In the mouth it was the most dense, thick, syrupy, oily beer I have every tasted. While the alcohol lever is high (15%) and you know it is there, it is never hot. The flavors from the nose burst into the palate covering every nook and cranny.

It's oddly smooth for a beer pike this with a very, very big mouthful. It almost feels like soapy water in the mouth and has a cloudy appearance and an orange color with a thin white head. Easy to tell its Treehouse by looking at it.  It was a draft poured into a clear plastic cup (really Treehouse???) so by the time it reached me, it had no real scent to speak of. If you poured Very Green or even Green, I probably couldn't tell the difference between the three of them. This is a beer geek's beer who might be able to pick out incredibly subtle notes.  I much prefer Juice Machine, King Julius or Heady Topper. It's not by any means a bad beer. In fact, it beats the pants off any store bought IPA. I do notice that even though it has a high ABV, one of these doesn't buzz me up the way a lot of other beers do. That's kind of been my Treehouse curse ... maybe my body is protected against a good buzz because I drink Treehouse so often. I did notice that I had a lemon peel taste in my mouth for about an hour after drinking this.   The bottom line ... I wouldn't go out of my way to get this but would grab a couple cans if I was at TH and it was on their list. I know this is an unpopular opinion on here given the high ratings but I also didn't love Very Hazy which is an incredibly high ranking beer, so maybe it's me.",0.5964208531896129,4.25,0.3336
Green,"Treehouse is a very hyped up brewery and since they're only 45 minutes away, I mad it a point to check out some of their brews. Green was recommended to me I think galaxy hops are the stuff of legends when brewed right. I heard green was one of the best beers Treehouse makes, and that leaves me a little worried. It a good beer no doubt, but its not what its cracked up to be. I taste lots of peaches and a general IPA kind of taste. Overall, its a good beer, but not worth the hype.  Peace~",0.5485447985680855,4.25,0.3335
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Out of a corked, capped, and foiled bottle, 2006 vintage. Pours a dirty plum purple color with fizzy pale pink colored head that settled into a solid ring. The aroma is of raspberry puree with some light oak and lemon. Nice and fruity, wine like. The taste is of unripe raspberries and lemon, white vinegar, pepper, and oak. Very much a tart bomb. The feel is light and very carbonated; very tart and astringent. For folks that love tart bombs and very dry brews this is an A++ but it's just not my thing. I rated mouthfeel and drinkability at a 3 because of this.",0.6269213353943222,3.0,0.3331

Madagascar,"Finally got to try this. Good amount of vanilla in this, with hints of chocolate. My old complaint with it is that the body is a bit weird. I think maybe because it's a milk stout instead of a RIS? Also, there's quite a bit more carbonation than I normally like.   Also, I think maybe the lactose in this is  throwing me off and giving me a weird kind of aftertaste. Although, it seems characteristic of 4 Hands stouts. I guess it doesn't help that all their stouts are milk stouts.   That being said, it's still really good and not overly sweet. Glad I got to pick it up",0.5922685344487941,4.0,0.3291

Chocolate Rain,"2012 bottle courtesy of Vincent at our crazy Antwerp tasting. Thanks everyone for an amazing night that will long have a special place in my heart and liver. Sampled next to a 2011 Black Tuesday, in a 50-50 blend of the two and even mixed with a lambic (which was dead gorgeous). Yeah, that's how crazy things got.  A: Pours a chestnut brown going into black. Very little head with awesome oily lacing that gets swept away by the alcohol. You can tell just by looking at it this is going to be one boozy beast.  S: Bourbon, vanilla and milk chocolate. No real bitter notes from dark chocolate, which I was expecting since this was matured on whole cocoa nibs. The differences with Black Tuesday are there, but they are very subtle at best. It seems the cocoa has mostly subdued the oaky notes from the barrel.  T: First things to hit the tongue are bourbon, vanilla, sweet Japanese soy sauce and creamy milk chocolate. Some woody notes, but very subtle if so. This is distinctly less sweet than the Black Tuesday, whereas I was expecting the complete opposite due to added vanilla during maturation. The cocoa nibs are sadly all but lost to me and that's a bit of a shame: the bitterness and slight acidity of a roasted cocoa bean would have cut through all that sweetness beautifully. Again, the booze is very present and borderline hot. It could do with some aging.  M: Soft carbonation that's only just enough to remind you that you're drinking a beer and not syrup. Very fitting for the style.  O: Though the maturation on cocoa nibs is sadly a bit lost to me, I preferred this over its base beer. Where the alcohol in Black Tuesday came out just a touch more aggressively because of the sweetness in it, the added maturation on this seems to have mellowed out some of that hotness. Since there are currently no Choccy Rains older than a year and a half and the first batch is very hard to get, this beer will take some time before it reaches its peak. When the time comes, I'll be sure to give it another shot.",0.6244010688420912,4.0,0.3223
Scaled Up,"Poured from a can into a snifter. Canned 2/7/17.  A: Pours a super hazy, opaque, pale yellowish-orange in color with a short, foamy, paper white head with minimal retention. Thin, white lacing throughout.  S: Nose consists of aromas of tropical fruit and citrus including melons, pineapple, mango, guava, orange, and grapefruit. Mild notes of piney and earthy hops.  T: Juicy hop bomb! Starts off with huge bitter notes of grapefruit, orange rind, and tangerine followed by milder notes of melons, guava, and pineapple. Leaves a piney, resinous, palate-smacking hop bitterness that lingers for a lengthy period of time.  F: Medium bodied. Smooth and crisp with moderate carbonation.  O: Overall, this is a great DIPA.

Dank resinous bitterness though subdued, and a dry finish.  Mouthfeel is a nice medium body and smooth with higher carbonation than some of their other beers.

Oh boy is this one tasty brew. usually dank doesn't do much for me, but this balance is devastatingly spot on. 37 days to the day after being bottled. the mix of hops hits this palate perfectly.   close to full on the mouth, slightly bitter and sour on the finish.   overall, this is one of the most dangerously drinkable 9.4's you will find.

Semi-resilient lacing leaves a broken ring behind.  S- Sweet aroma with notes of brown sugar, vanilla and astringent oak.  T- Delectable flavor contains notes of marshmallow, caramel, more vanilla and of course bourbon. The molasses is there but not particularly prominent. Definitely on the sweeter side with the oak taking a bit of a backseat.  M- Silky smooth with medium-low carbonation and the fullest of bodies.  O- Pretty out of this world, I must say.

T - Runs the gamut of New England hop flavors with orange, mango, peach and then throws in dank weed-like hops on the finish. It transitions to something different at every stage and keeps you guessing.  F - Medium and exactly what you want for the style. A little flat and undercarbonated. Not sure if that is how it is supposed to be or if was this particular batch.  O - Swish belongs in the same crowd as other critically acclaimed New England IPA's/DIPA's as it gives you everything you'd expect from the region and has (I think) better drinkability and a smoother ride from start to finish.",0.6324667714400375,4.75,0.3045

Haze,"Canned date of 07/20/16  Appearance - Pours extremely hazy and orange in color with an off-white, frothy finger width head. Fair retention, resulting in a thin, consistent layer of suds across the surface. Fair lacing, most of which is made up of spotting found around the glass.  Smell - Plenty of juiciness on the nose, with orange, pineapple, lesser peach and a hint of spice.  Taste - Follows the nose. Juicy notes of orange and pineapple upfront, following shortly with lesser notes of peach and mango. A touch of hop spice and some stonefruit pit nuttiness mid-taste. The back end rings with fair grapefruit pith and some light, bready sweetness.  Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth drinker, though a touch of chalkiness (presumably from the yeast) in the texture.   Overall - One heck of a NE-style DIPA, and certainly one of the trendsetters of the style. If there's one knock, it may be a bit too yeasty, but I'm nitpicking. This is a damn tasty brew.",0.6901425570163343,4.25,0.296

Sip Of Sunshine,"Just started seeing this one locally, although not regularly, so picked up a 4-pack of 16-oz cans. Popping the tab brings a very noticeable citrus / pine aroma. Poured slowly, it makes a finger-high bubbly head that doesn't stay long. No carbonation afterward. Amber color, which should have been expected for the style, though I was half expecting it to be the vibrant yellow color of the can. First sips are pink grapefruit forward, with some pine following. Bitter hops, think pink grapefruit rind, show up after the sip, but balanced by a sweeter malt backend. Alcohol hides very well, but does catch up. Mouthfeel is heavier, syrupier than expected. I think marketing and some prior review bias tainted my expectations for an airy, light, sunshiney drink that would float down my throat. Some carbonation would have made it more crushable, but overall a very tasty and balanced beer. Similar IMO to HopSlam, but with less of that honey vibe.",0.6823645305876275,4.0,0.2922
Sip Of Sunshine,"Pours deep golden-orange with a small fluffy off-white head which dissipates fairly quickly. Almost no cloudiness. Nice aroma; I think I can smell my favourite hop? Mosaic. That said, the can says this IPA is lupulin laden & the can does not say which hops are used. Did they use any whole hops? I do not know. Smell and taste are as desribed on can - forward tropical hops with some floral & grassiness; just hinting at dankness. Smooth somewhat juicy mouthfeel with any bitterness being very quick to be overshadowed by the citrus from the hops.

Nelson,"Pale straw color, slightly off white head dropped quickly. Aroma is predominantly melon and that funky wine-like/ gooseberry fruitiness that Nelson brings. Slight honey malt and pepper-like rye on nose. Flavor is that same melon/ white wine fruit, but amplified. Passion fruit and pithy grapefruit also come through. Hop bitterness is on high side but I dig it. Malt character is clean, dry and a peppery rye is very noticeable. It works well here and adds depth to the hop bomb. Very tasty.",0.6832220942002076,4.5,0.2846
Nelson,"Hazy golden yellow. Smells like cotton candy, lime soda, black pepper. Taste of citrus and reminds me of a hoppy wheat beer. Aftertaste is bitter like citrus rind. The rye is subtle and blends well with the hops. I thought this was going to be a malty ipa but so much more fruity and complex than I expected. I'll have another.",0.6562052746892476,4.0,0.2846

Sip Of Sunshine,"16oz can dated ""30JUL19,"" reviewed on 8/10/19. Slightly hazy, golden in color. Citrusy, floral aroma that's very muted and disappointing. It smells like your average west coast IPA. I'm getting no tropical fruit notes at all, and this is a fairly fresh can. The flavor profile follows suit -- fairly dry, moderate apparently bitterness, not at all ""juicy."" Grassy, pithy, and other associated flavor notes that you would associate with what are now considered ""classic"" American IPAs.   I'm wondering if there was a canning mixup here, because this was a major disappointment. For years, SoS has been a top ranked DIPA, and I was excited that it was finally getting distributed to NJ. If this four-pack is truly indicative of the beer, and not an aberration, then it's nothing more than a run of the mill DIPA. If you're looking for a juicy DIPA, then Two Juicy, also brewed at Two Roads, is a much better way to spend your money.",0.6719392403260541,3.5,0.2815

Nectarine Premiere,"Bottle on-site at de Garde. The aroma and flavor of this beer are incredible, but it had very low carbonation. Not sure if it was just the bottle I had or if that is typical. Either way, it is a great fruited wild ale.",0.6279257833670594,4.5,0.2772
Green,"Pours a hazy golden amber with a one and a half finger frothy head that reduces to a halo and thin film of bubbles. Perfect lacing.  Aroma has a lot of pineapple and orange and grass. There's a little bit of bubble gum, pine, and stone fruit in there too.  Taste is a combination of orange, grass, and bubble gum. Not excellent but good. There's quite a bit of peach mid palate which melds into a solid but subdued grapefruit bitterness. Hints of pineapple and orange rind and passion fruit along the way too.  When they say Tree House beers are creamy, this one is the cream of the crop. Medium bodied, incredibly smooth and creamy, low to moderate carbonation.  While this is definitely a very good beer it's not my favorite flavor profile. It is however, the best example of a creamy smooth mouthfeel in NEIPAs. What matters: I'd never turn one down.",0.6998013431575838,4.25,0.2762

Pours a deep brown, nearly black body with a two finger brown head that reduces slowly to leave a ring of foam and little lacing.   Aromas are heavy on the bourbon, cocoa and light vanilla, dark- bittersweet chocolate, lightly roasty with coffee aromas. Not getting much maple on the aroma.   On the tongue is dark chocolate and bourbon, roasty malt, marshmallow, caramel, sweet vanilla, chocolate cookies. A slight oxidized off flavor included. Mouthfeel is kinda thin with medium-low carbonation.  Overall decent. For a bourbon barrel aged stout, this is on point, but I didn't get any maple whatsoever in the taste or aromas, so I have to give it a 3.75 final rating because it wasn't as advertised.",0.6345753035292945,3.75,0.2732

Feel: Medium bodied  Overall: This one is a step below Duet in my opinion. You can definitely taste the rye on the back end after big hits of hops and citrus up front.

Society & Solitude #4,"A-This beer is a murky, glowing amber color. Head is mild but it leaves a bunch of stringy lacing.   S-Such a concentrated grapefruit aroma. Literally wreaks of ruby red grapefruit. Coarse and ridden with deep tropical fruits. Pine is also stressed. I wouldn't call the nose 'bright'. It's more of an intensely concentrated aroma. Either way, the nose is world class. Wreaks of hoppy fruits.  T-Brilliant flavor! Ruby, ruby, ruby, ruby red GRAPEFRUIT. Citrus and tropic fruits. All of the fruitiness is covered in a shell of rigid pine hops. Malt is built into the flavor but I stands no chance against the ridiculous hoppiness of the beer.  M-Medium-to-heavy body. Has that 'Hill Farmstead' carbonation level. Feel drawn from a cask. Resinous. Feels Iike a muscular DIPA.  O/D-Simply phenomenal. One of the best beers I have ever had. Bloated with hops.

Scaled Up,"From a 16oz can, dated 10/04/16. Served in an imperial pint/nonic.  Pours a well hazed orange-gold with a scant finger of short-lived head, minimal lacing.  Smells of oranges, melons and crackers, weeds and sweat.  Taste is grapefruit juice, grapefruit pith, cantaloupe, grape, lime, bread roll and peppery spice. Finishes with an unexpected hint of cane sugar, a long, lingering hop burn to the tongue, and a warming alcohol burn in the gullet  Feel is smooth, medium-heavy bodied, adequately carbonated and semi-dry.  Overall, as usual, an excellent DIPA. If I had to find fault (and, apparently, I do), I think it's perhaps not the most fortuitous blending of hop varieties and the alcohol presence actually manages to feel bigger than its stated 8%.

Dull yellow in color with an extreme amount of cloudiness. Plethora of small rising bubbles. Lacing is subtle and very thick. SMELL: Huge aromas of mango, papaya, peach, guava, and apricot commingle with strong aromas of spicy hops, orange, grapefruit, and tangerine along with mild white bread, earthy yeast, and piney hop aromas. TASTE: Very strong flavors of mango, papaya, guava, peach, and apricot first burst on to the palate. The taste is amplified as strong piney hop, spicy hop, orange, grapefruit, and tangerine flavors immediately follow. Balance is finally achieved as mild white bread and earthy yeast along with subtle bitter hop flavors finish off the taste theatrical as all previous flavors press on.  FEEL: Somewhere between full-bodied and medium-bodied. Carbonation is mild. Goes down smooth and somewhat creamy. Finishes with a strong and unpleasant dryness.

Enjoy By IPA,"Poured into a tulip  Appearance: this is without a doubt the brightest beer I have ever tried. Golden with no haze whatsoever. The head is bright white with poor retention. The short duration of the head is what prevents this beer from scoring a 5 in appearance.  Aroma: dank hops. Pine and pineapple.  Flavor: mouth-coating lupulin. Super hoppy, oily. There is little malt backbone – just hops. The label states “10 different [hop] varieties”; there are no specific hop flavors. No specific fruit, pine, etc. No alcohol flavor or heat.  Mouthfeel: this is heavy-medium, heavy even considering the 9.4% abv.   Overall: damn tasty. This is far better than most of the 2X IPAs on the market. At $16.99 / 6-pack, perhaps the price exceeds the quality, but this is a damn tasty and worthwhile beer nonetheless.",0.685802227607075,4.5,0.2035

All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,Can dated 09/23/16.  Pours pitch black with a half-inch beige head that remains as a thin ring on top and leaves spots of lace.

Sip Of Sunshine,"I'm going against the grain here; this is one of the most over-hyped beers I've had.  3/22/17 date on can, poured into a Teku glass. Poured a hazy, pale straw color with a laced white head. Honestly, I think the look of this beer is probably it's best feature. The nose was uninspiring; lots of floral and lemon shining through, but faint overall. Going down, a very watery brew, especially for an IIPA. Flavors seemed muddled and lackadaisical, with hints of citra and some pine. Nothing jumped out as far as a taste profile, though, and it finished as watery as it started.

A big punchy and simple fruit aroma.  Taste is also big on pineapple, more dank than the nose suggests, candied orange, orange rind, lemon zest, peach/stone fruit, sweeter up front then light grapefruit bitter and drying. Little yeasty fruit ester character.  Medium body, lighter carbonation, fairly smooth.  A tasty New England style DIPA, one of the most prominent pineapple aroma and taste IPA's I've had.

Taste: Mild to moderate bitterness that is balanced nicely with pilsner malts and wheat. Juicy oranges and tropical fruits. Melon rind and grass notes. Lingering finish of spicy garlic and onion.   Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer that has adequate carbonation. Soft and creamy body. Very drinkable for a DIPA; no booze to be found.  Overall: Very solid hoppy beer.

Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy bodied with a low to moderate carbonation. Finish: Very dry.

Beatification,"Bottled 01-10-12. Approaching 2 years old.  A: Pours a hazy golden. Mid-sized and fizzy white head. Head fizzes out pretty quickly. Moderate streaks of lacing.   S: Heavy on the sour citrus. Lemons mainly I'd say. Maybe some orange peel too. Big and bright and juicy aroma. Very acidic.   T: Oh yeah, this is a sour one. Extremely sour citrus. Very acidic and biting. About half a step away from biting into a lemon. Very crisp and quite dry, especially in the aftertaste. Long, long lingering sour citrus flavors. Brief hint of oak in the finish before the aftertaste.  M: Crisp and dry medium body. Teeth-chatteringly sour and dry. Fine carbonation.  O: A serious contender for the most sour beer I've ever had. Not far from drinking lemon juice. Honestly, surprisingly pleasant. Not a lot of funk to this one, just straight-up bracing sourness. I expected more funkiness due to the brett and the almost 2-year old bottle. I think the sourness just obliterates anything else. I actually prefer this sort of sour. It's quite tasty and refreshing but drinkability does suffer due to the extreme sourness. Not exactly a sesssionable brew - but that's not the point of course.",0.6847290124585147,4.25,0.1943

Nose of mango with readily apparent alcohol heat, floral, green, some honey quickly followed by grapefruit, tangerine, and more booze.  Taste is grapefruit, tangerine rind, mango, and a honeyed booze character.  The mouthfeel is fairly sticky and oily. I find that the mango puree imparts somewhat of a syrupy texture into the beer that really makes it less enjoyable.  This beer has a lasting sweetness that somehow reinforces the alcohol burn in an unpleasant way.

Double Orange Starfish,"Pours a blurry pale orange with a massive soft white head that seems content to stick around for the long haul. Sticky icky lacing as well.  Nose has elements of creamy orange and... wait is that worcestershire? I have... I've never smelled that in a beer before. Some dank element as well.  Small bitter NEIPA lead in that brings out some citrus and acidic pineapple before a mildly umami middle passage (I assume whatever is providing this is the same as gave me the worcestershire impression above, though it doesn't taste like that... just kind of umami), and a swing back to a light dull bitterness that's like earthy citrus.   Feel is soft and round with an almost paste-like coating to the interior of the craw and blanket effervescence. Finish is that NEIPA character that's somewhere between not quite but almost in the vein of sickly sweet and some mild bitterness.  This is an interesting one for sure. I've gotten some umami suggestions in beers before, but never quite like this one. I can see why people who like this kind of IPA would really like this one.

Madagascar,"Pours near black with some light coming through around the edges. Delicate khaki head settles to a ring. Aroma brings it with the vanilla. A lot going on, but bottom line there a tantalizing marriage between the bourbon, oak, and vanilla beans. The vanilla just smells so pure and so damn good! I'm usually let down with the flavors of vanilla stouts that smell divine as they can come off as too artificial, but not the case here. Delicate, refined, smooth, balanced, and in no way artificial. Hint of bitterness on the back end ties everything together. Body is light, yet creamy. So freaking drinkable.  Overall...incredible.

Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,I had this on tap at the brewpub before buying my bottles. A very solid beer but I don't see how this is the #1 rated beer in Ohio. I am currently drinking my 2nd bottle and it is very flat. Both bottles so far have had the faintest of hissing so I'm guessing very under carbed.,0.4768153255857002,3.25,0.1145
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),Reviewed on 6/5/17. 2016 bottle  L - Pours a dark brown with a thin mocha colored head. S - I get notes of milk chocolate sugary sweetness and bourbon. T - Subtle chocolate flavors and honey sweetness on the finish. A bit of a weird aftertaste. F - A little thin O - Just not a lot going on here and there is little balance. Kind of a disappointment considering it's price and reputation. Not worth the hype.,0.6222831727262396,4.0,0.1131
Beatification,"A: A contrast of transparency and haze from the yellow, and gold pour. Head retention, and lacing are marginal  S: Funk, acidity, wild, and earthy. Lots to seek out in the brett and oak notes, including some fruit undertones (apple, pineapple, citrus, lemon)   T: Earth(y) wildness; pleasurably tart and funky: apples, lemon, grass, a subtle vinous.

Madagascar,"Jet black in color with absolutely no penetration to light. A fingernail of brown foam rests on top. Heavy Brussels lacing.

Chocolate Rain,"Poured from the bottle into a taster. 2012 vintage.  Appeared a dark brown color - very thin in appearance which was quite shocking. Could have to do with the high ABV. Minimal light brown head disappeared quickly.  Smell was amazingly complex. Vanilla, chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, dark fruits, marshmallow, cream.....ALCOHOL. Just a ton going on.  Taste followed the smell. Alcohol is definitely present...quite hot still even after a few years in the cellar. Very complex, very sweet. Can only drink a few ounces of this one.  Mouth-feel is where this one lacks. I am assuming it is cause of the high abv, but for a beer that is this complex I'd prefer a better feel to it. This is far too light in the mouth.  Overall not going to lie, a bit disappointed by this one. Mouth-feel is just not correct for a beer packing so much complexity.",0.6748037179856101,4.25,0.0981

Schaerbeekse Kriek,I ordered a bottle for our table at Teresa's Next Door. Poured into a flute/wine glass.  Appearance: It pours a cloudy red color with a layer of off white head that fades to a very thin ring on top of the pour.  Smell: This one is really tart right off the bat. Sour cherries and some funk along with a mild vinegar note. The cherries are the star here.  Taste: Even more sour than the smell. Vinegar and tart cherries with a lambic funk. This is a really refreshing fruit lambic. I'm getting a mild bitterness from the aged hops. The finish is very tart.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with tingly carbonation and a finish that is incredibly dry.  Overall: This is the first time I've gotten a full pour of this beer and it didn't disappoint.

Fort Point Pale Ale,"Thanks to HighLowJack for sending this one! Reviewed from (long-standing) notes. Poured from a 16 oz. can into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass.  A: Turbid yellowish gold, typical of the New England IPA style. A thin fluffy white head forms, with low visible carbonation.  S: Melon and citrus, dank and tropical. Lighter flowery, minty, and spicy hops. Biscuity malts and some wheat but without almost any grainy character. Nice, though I’m not blown away.  T: Melon, tangerine, and citrus rind. Dankness swells up with pineapple and tropical fruit following. Biscuity malts don't add a ton of sweetness, but the bill seems hefty for an APA. It finishes with more dank and melon and orange juice, and stays only very modestly bitter in the hang.  M: This is full-bodied for anything calling itself an APA; it's even leaving sheets on the sides of the glass. The carbonation is a touch on the low side, and there's minimal alcohol flavors.  O: This was awfully tasty. I'm not sure that it lived up to its sizeable hype or not. But I can certainly see where the hype came from. Very, very good.",0.6751544577161327,4.25,0.082

Nose expresses citrus, pineapple and rind. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of a subtle piney quality and a slight candied flavor to the fruit. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) with a crisp carbonation and a pleasant acidity. Overall, another top-notch IPA coming out of the Northeast Kingdom.

Black Tuesday,"I have yet to have a single beer from The Bruery that I felt had warranted any of the hype that the beer and brewery had generated, and Black Tuesday really was no different. It falls into the same vein of so many other barrel aged stouts in that it has that similar coca-cola taste that far too many brewers shoot for. The body is too thin, the taste is overly sweet, the heat picks up in an unsettling manner as it warms, the smell is cloying instead of engaging, and I've already explained the taste.   Please, folks, don't judge this on the difficulty you had getting a bottle, or the hype that everyone else spouts. Instead, take a step back and compare it to other BA stouts. It isn't special, and it doesn't distinguish itself when you set it with other world-class offerings.  Thankfully I did not pay or trade for this, but unfortunately a friend of mine did. Neither of us will make the mistake of looking for this again.",0.6125772472256696,2.0,0.0721
Beatification,"The beer comes in a hazy bright golden yellow color.  The aroma is straight lemon juice. Extremely tart. A bit of funk as well.  The flavor follows of that tartness in the front. It's quite aggressive and then moves onto a light wheat and biscuity malt hits in the middle as there is a second wave of aggressive tartness of lemon and pineapple juice. There's hints of funk throughout.  A well made beer but the tartness for me was a bit too aggressive. However, recently have Batch 5, I much preferred the restrained manner and less tart qualities in the beer.",0.6943294431241658,4.25,0.0689

Vicinity,"Cloudy and orange, has an orange juice look to it. The smell is juicy, what I've come to expect from a NE IPA, I smelled some grapefruit in there, and maybe some peach. Flavorwise, it's kind of sweet, again, very juicy, as one would expect, and not piney. Honestly, it reminds me of a sweeter, more tropical brass monkey. (I consider this to be a good thing.)

Sip Of Sunshine,"Comes in a mostly clear, slightly hazy copper with a fluffy white head that dies down after a few minutes into a thin ring that leaves splotchy lacing. The aroma is floral and pungent, lots of grapefruit zest and peel, orange pith, pine, toasted caramel malt, a bit of pineapple. On the palate, you get lots of orange and yellow grapefruit peel upfront, along with a touch of mango. The malt backbone is slightly toasty caramel, but not sweet. Finishes with a big dose of pine, and then a lingering grapefruit peel bitterness. Finishes fairly crisp. The mouthfeel is medium, well-carbonated, slightly oily from hops, finishes moderately crisp and slightly dry. Overall, it's still a really good IPA, but a bit overrated, in this BA's opinion. It's solid, but it's just a slightly above average West Coast style IPA.",0.70022789899489,4.25,0.0566

Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,"Stark black with a minimal mocha head that can actually be swirled to a thicker dense blanket that's mesmerizing to look at.  Smell is a rich blend of chocolatey walnut and nougat with waxy oak that's a little musty and peppery. Hints of brownie and Tootsie Roll follow.  Taste starts sweet and chocolately with a maple-coconut syrup undertone, and an exceptionally roasty, almost umami overtone. There's plenty of oaky wood, with sticky raisin and date, but a tongue numbing heat builds with a bitter ashy char in the finish.  A medium to thin crisp body, along with the booziness, does keep this from being elite for me, but those attributes don't seem to be the sort of things to deter most others, as they've been putting out stouts much like this for a long time. I think the Side Project influence did add a bit more char and roastiness, but most people need to know, this isn't actually a blend, but a new recipe concocted and brewed by both brewers together.",0.681605519870275,4.25,0.0516

Beatification,"I've had this before, but this review is for a recent tasting. I drank this alongside a Temptation and Supplication, as well as various ratio'd blends of the three with a pluot muddle to christen my vintage Temptation/Supplication/Beatification/Compunction glass.  Batch 5.  Slightly hazy golden-yellow pour, with a finger or so of white head that retained nicely and streaked the glass with thin lacing. Aroma was pretty intense: lactic, acetic, sour, green apple, citrus. More intense sourness/tartness in the taste...I was told this batch gets ""sour in a bad way"" with age. I didn't really think it was ""in a bad way,"" but it wasn't exactly smooth. Flavors of green apple, crabapple, lemon, oak, brett, hay, vinegar, white grapes; lactic and tannic notes came out more as it warmed. Medium body, moderate carbonation, heartburn-inducing. Overall good, but probably one of the lower beers on the ""-ation"" totem poll for me.  Cutting this with Temptation and Supplication really took the edge off.

Dragonsaddle,"Tried it from the can and also poured into a snifter for review purposes. Really really cloudy beer, dirty yellow with almost a brownish tint. Very healthy lacing, but I can't tell how active the carbonation is because it is so cloudy. A gigantic juicy hop bomb on the nose. I could just keep smelling this thing if it didn't taste so damn good as well. Big juicy hop characteristics for the taste. It doesn't present much in the way of bitterness, maybe just a little at the end, but it's very citrusy with a slight sharp zesty tanginess that hits the center of the tongue. For a beer that is almost 12%, the alcohol is hidden rather well. This is a really outstanding beer.",0.6481029590109059,4.75,-0.0135

Todd The Axe Man,"Pours a murky, nearly opaque, amber color with a modest cap of coarse, white froth. Hop aroma evokes pineapple and tangerines along with biscuity, crackery malt and a dollop of honey and alcohol.  The taste features sharp, unabashedly resinous hops that subjugate the maltier tones suggested by the nose. Even after affording it time to open up, the best my discriminating palate can do is to label this a pure hop-bomb. Medium body, mild carbonation, and copious amounts of hops yield a slick, slightly oily mouthfeel.  If you’re a slave to the bitter stuff, this will give you all you can handle to be sure.

Chocolate Rain,"Served in a wedding snifter.  For whatever reason, I still feel a decent amount of pride in the fact that I still have not seen the ""Chocolate Rain"" video in its entirety. Regardless, this stuff pours a very dark black-brown topped by a half-finger of wan sandstone foam. The nose comprises cheap boozy whiskey, wood, and a twinge of chocolate syrup. The taste holds notes of overly-sweet chocolate syrup, vanilla bean, toasted caramel, and bourbon. I don't ever say this, considering my sweet tooth is as long as an average femur, but this stuff was just way the hell too sweet for its own good. It's cloying, o'erwhelming, and wrong. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a semi-chewy feel. Overall, I don't get the praise this beer receives. I like incredibly sweet things, and it was too sweet for me. The bourbon is only there to color things in a drunken manner and provide an extra jolt of booziness, which itself is completely unnecessary, given the general booziness already pervading the proceedings.

Black Tuesday,"I've been a Bruery Society member for 3 years - and have now tried 3 vintages of BT. I've recently come to the conclusion that I simply don't like this beer.   I feel that a bourbon barrel aged stout should have certain characteristics:   A deep, dark, opaque black color A rich mouthfeel Little to no carbonation It should taste like beer - with notes of the bourbon barrel characteristics  I feel that BT defies all of these. The color is more of a dark amber. Mouthfeel is very thin and perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this beer. The carbonation - while not very noticeable while pouring - is definitely noticeable while drinking. This beer usually falls in the 18-20+ %ABV range - which I'm all for - if the bourbon/booziness isn't overpowering.

Green,"What can be said about this beer that hasn't already been said. When you sip the beer you can TELL it's intensely hopped, but the hops come through as soft pineapple and oranges. There's a sharpness there, but it's completely dulled by the waves of tropical fruit bubblegum. When the New England IPA craze dust settles, Green will stand alongside the likes of Heady Topper and Pliny as timeless beers.   I've been drinking this beer for a number of years now, and it's one of the few beers I'll stand in line at Treehouse for.",0.5956012395140978,5.0,-0.1128

Aroma of dry hops notes with some dank aromas and light citrusy notes. Taste is mostly dominated by dry dank notes with dry citrusy notes, some very light residual sugar notes with a dry finish.

Todd The Axe Man,"Let me start off by saying this beer is a banger. Took me completely by surprise. Dark orange, some particulate/haze. Aroma is Mosaic hops, piney, berries, slamming.

Sure Bet,"Looks very opaque and cloudy with slight head but wicked lacing on glass. Aroma is definetaly tropical fruit with mango (duh) and bit of dank citrus. Taste follows with that mango fruit (but not as much as I thought I'd pick out) and an earthy floral dankness. There is also a very pleasant peppery spice in the finish, probably from the Mosiac hops...but I like it!   Moderate bitterness that's slightly astringent...Not like Scarlet Betta though which i didn't care for.

Black Tuesday,"2016 vintage. This was not at all the beer I was expecting and I can't help but feel disappointed. The appearance was very thin as it pours and all brown town. Zero head, just a thin and pale beige ring left behind. Drank this on the back patio with family on a very sunny evening and it still has a very dark brown appearance, no black. First two sips is nothing but heat...lots of heat! Bourbon and barrel char right off the bat. As it warms, more of the base beer flavors start coming through. Vanilla, Chocolate, tobacco and dark fruit. Mouthfeel is the upside to this as it has a much more creamier and full bodied mouthfeel than the appearance would led on. Overall, the base beer is very disappointing and the barrel does everything it can to hide it.

Swish,"My first beer from these guys, I held this a couple of days to let the anticipation build. I can hold out no longer.   I cracked this open - a pineapple factory exploded in my kitchen. Just an incendiary array of hop aromas. This may be the most aromatic beer I've had.  It looks like a glass of pineapple/grapefruit juice to me, and Mrs O confirmed it when I showed it to her (""That's not a beer - it's a glass of jooooce"" she said in her ""Norwegian by way of Indiana"" Minnesota accent). It is so thick, it literally swallows light.  The taste is all pineapple and citrus fruits - the Citra/Mosaic/Simcoe hop combo makes for an interesting ""citrusy/danky/oniony"" flavor profile. And the sneaky thing is that there's no alcohol presence - at all - when you take a sip (or a gulp), but if you wait a bit between sips, you can feel the alcohol burn. This is a sneaky dangerous beer.  The feel is all creamy oats - and then the hops slip in and remind you that you're drinking a heavily-hopped DIPA, and you get some spritziness from the hops that really elevate this.  I wish I'd purchased 2 cases of this instead of 2 pints, because it's phenomenal.",0.6166249298529045,4.5,-0.17
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"2016 vintage, bottle #80. Roughly 4 oz pour into a white wine glass. The balance of maple and coffee on both the nose and taste is truly remarkable. I can't begin to explain or understand how a beer delivering so much flavor with this level of viscosity doesn't turn into a sweet diabetes bomb. The mouthfeel is unreal; a velvet-like texture I've never quite experienced.   I had been wanting and waiting to try KBBS for a very long time. Considering all the talk about this beer, my expectations going in were extremely high. This beer somehow eclipsed everything I thought it would be. To put it in comparison, it was imbibed between 2014 Assassin and Label Us Notorious, and completely blew those two away. Not even close. Hope I'm lucky enough to have it again someday.",0.6213810489043441,5.0,-0.1744
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Canned 11 days ago. My twenty-fifth review of a Trillium beer!   L -- Standard Trill-juice orange haze with a small rocky white head produced with aerated pour. Minimal retention or lacing. I've had similar experiences with certain batches of DDH Congress, so my guess is the sub-par head is due to the intense late-addition hopping.  S -- Lime, Concord grape, citrus peel, mild fusels, watermelon, guava, perfumey floral, and a hint of that fresh paper smell when you open a new ream of copy paper. Sweet, clean, juicy T -- Watermelon Jolly Rancher, Concord grape, citrus zest, bready malts, grapefruit flesh, grassy earthiness F -- Crisp and semi-dry. Tapering, earthen, astringent bitterness on the finish. Medium mouthfeel, medium carb.  O -- The zestiness imparted by the El Dorado hops reminds me a lot of Trillium's experimentation with the Enigma hop, but it's much more rounded here by the overripe watermelon and grapefruit character. Still getting sticker shock on these DDH releases, though, even after many trips to the brewery..... Knocking 0.25 off the overall for that reason alone  90/100",0.6739565468208784,4.25,-0.1759

Sang Noir,"750ml, caged and corked bottle (2015 Project, @9.9% ABV) - part of a few new Cascade offerings to recently arrive around here.   This beer pours a slightly hazy, dark ruby brown colour, with three fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and mostly fizzy tan head, which leaves some mountaintop snowpack lace around the glass as it quickly blows off.   It smells of sour cherries, vanilla-accented wet wood, musty red wine, grainy and bready pale malt, aged lemons, artisanal vinegar, and a further reduced brown sugar sweetness. The taste is incredibly tart lemon, cherry and blackberry fruity notes, gritty and bready caramel malt, red balsamic wine vinegar, a subtle barrel stave woodiness, crushed red grapes, and a mild earthiness that I cannot quite attribute to the presence of hops.  The carbonation is adequate in its palate-coating frothiness, the body a solid medium weight, and sort of smooth, that is once my tongue's cognitive dissonance generator finally kicks in. It finishes trending dry and still moderately sour, yet with a scrappy, raging before the dying of the light malt, vanilla, and fruit offset.  Overall - holy shivering shit-bots, is this an intense and pleasantly surprising concoction, one that is both one-sided and complex at the same time. Not yet mentioned is the just south of 10 points of alcohol that are essentially AWOL in the experience. 'Black Blood' is a suitable enough moniker here, though I am having trouble explaining exactly why.",0.6900178355866771,4.5,-0.186

Pineapple juice and grapefruit juice battle in my mind's olfactory sensory perceptions for supremacy.  T: Follows the nose, with a big juicy wallop of pineapple juice, grapefruit and oranges. Also ripe peaches and apricot. Finishes with a good sharp bitterness that's sometimes lacking in these NE-style juice bombs. Frankly, I bumped up the taste score for that reason. Just a touch of peppery spice on the aftertaste, perhaps from the 7.5% ABV.   M: I will say it again: juicy. Call it medium in heft.   O: Phenomenal.

Closest Blackberry wild I've had to VSB  M - Medium bodied, creamy yet sharp and crisp. Bright.  O - This is a small step below VSB and commands much less.

Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Allowed to warm up for 15minutes out of a 45F fridge prior to serving into snifter.   Pours black, minimal head. Aroma is very intense coffee, some bourbon, alcohol. Taste follows with the addition of some dark chocolate alongside smooth coffee and some vanilla notes from the barrels. Aside from the coffee, not much roast characteristic. A bit boozier than expected.   Mouthfeel was on the medium side of the spectrum. Well carbonated, perhaps a bit too much for my tastes with this style.  Overall, very good beer but a tad disappointing given the hype for me.",0.6748090714339628,4.25,-0.228
Sip Of Sunshine,"Absolutely fantastic beer! I have been drinking so many hazy beers lately that when this first poured I wondered if I forgot to roll the can.

Lots of citrus, maybe caramel/vanilla, but also that hop forward bitterness that hooked me on IPA's all those years ago. World class!",0.5803263038771417,4.75,-0.2289
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Typical orange hazy trillium beer.   Smell not as the other ddh beers I have had. Grapefruit dominates the nose.   While the mouthfeel is very creamy and enjoyable, the taste was a bit of letdown. A little more bitter than a typical ne ipa. Get the lime late mouthfeel.

Black Tuesday,"2012 Vintage. 75 cl. bottle sampled. Exited about trying this one finally, this has been a long time want of mine.  Huge gusher, seriously why? Almost 20 % ABV, really weird and really irritating.  A: Black, basically no head.   S: Huge sticky molasses nose, sweet sugar, alcohol, vanilla, very sweet, very sweet, nice,…   T: Lots of caramel, vanilla oak, sweet molasses, brown sugar, creamy, very sweet and very simple, no complexity and terribly exiting honestly. Finish is almost pure alcohol in the finish, light bitter herbs, sticky bitter stuff, quite sticky stuff, bit burn, near pure alcohol,… Seriously it is like they made a very simple RIS and poured some vodka in here, really drags this one down for me personally.  B: Flat, oily and sticky whole  It wasn’t a bad beer per se but it fell tremendously short of its reputation. It is very expensive, hard to get & it is nowhere near even my top 100 RIS’s. Simple, ridiculously, boozy, I really, really do not get the appeal of this beer.  Apparently as it turned out this works really well when blended with fruit lambic.",0.6502385559159475,4.0,-0.2344

He said the same thing about the two he had...There was something wrong with the beer and I love this style- juicy style IPA. The beer was so flawed I dumped both after a couple of sips. It literally tasted worse than my worst homebrews so there must have been a one off issue with this batch. No legible date stamp on the cans except for a 17'.

Feel: Thick and juicy yet not abrasive. Light bitter on the finish and just a hint of alcohol on the finish. Very drinkable for the ABV.  Overall: One intense IIPA. Big, juicy, and tongue buckling. Yet drinks way below its actual ABV. The flavors develop over the course of the sip adding an unexpected complexity that just adds to the beauty of this beer.

Nelson,"rance - The beer is a murky golden color that showed a big head.   Smell - Rye and citrus hops compose the nose.   Taste - The beer is very rye forward, but it is not over the top. Caraway seeds are almost detectable. The hops come into view with citric tendencies. The hops grow more bitter toward the back.

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"From old notes The beer is black, and it doesn't appear as viscous or syrupy as regular Dark Lord. The beer looks near.  The nose is unadulterated decadence. It's reminiscent of chocolate cookies, brown sugar, fudge, chocolate chips, and brownies. Oak isn't prominent, like I was expecting, but it is noticeable. I detect a little molasses and a whisper of vanilla. No oxidation in the nose? I'm astounded!  The flavor is fudge and chocolate cake with light vanilla and a little sugar. The chocolate is insanely rich. I detect a touch of astringency and subtle oak. So decadent. The finish is chocolate desert with a slight roast and a little heat. The mouthfeel is light and silky, not at all like the viscous and syrupy regular mouthfeel on Dark Lord. There's just a dash of oxidation in the flavor, but it's not detrimental.

M: It feels light- to medium-bodied and a little tart on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.

Aroma is a straight 5 when the Nelson hops are popping all funky, earthy, and aggressive. Everything Mosaic wishes it was!  Taste drops all that down under tropical and citrus funk vibe for you. Rye isn't much here except maybe providing more substance and color to the beer, you're not really gonna pick out any specific identifiers related to the malt/rye.   When this beer is right, its one of, if not the best bottled ipa in the world. Its phenomenal.

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Look: Pours a hazy muted orange-yellow color with a dense two finger head that's made up of lots of effervescent tiny pinhole sized bubbles.  Smell: I'm getting heady aromas of banana, rosemary, bitter orange and lemon rind, marjoram and mild gingerbread on the nose.  Taste: Phenomenal. Initially it starts off with a spicy yeasty flavor on the tongue that's reminiscent of banana, graham cracker and clove. I taste notes of vanilla wafer cookies and savory apple strudel mid palate. It finishes off on a slightly bitter dry floral note with hints of honey. Perfectly balanced.  Feel: Light-medium body. Bubbly, crisp, refreshing and flavorsome. Starts off spicy and sweet but finishes dry and slightly bitter so as not to become cloying. The yeast adds a little roughness and weight to the feel and it works really well.

Behind the sourness is the some barnyard funk lemon zest and vinegar  Mouthfeel: Light body lots of carbonation very sour and dry and makes you pucker  Overall: For the style this is a good beer but for me I find it hard to drink and could not see myself finishing a whole bottle.

Retention is good for a few minutes and leaves a thick ring of foam and generous amounts of lacing.  Smells of limes, clementines and vanilla sugar cookies.  The taste upfront is a melange of bitter citrus, lemons, both juice and pith, limes, orange peel and grapefruit juice... are there any citrus fruits I missed? Them, too. After the initial citrus assault, there's papaya, lots of pine sap and sugar cookies. Earthy and resinous, finishing with a long, lightly-lingering, tongue-coating citric bitterness.

Todd The Axe Man,"Pours a hazy opaque orange with almost no head. Steams of tiny bubbles course upwards in the beer - the only sign of any carbonation. Without that it would look completely flat.   Smell is a wonderful aroma of pine, citrus, orange, orange zest, and a bit of an herbal aroma that takes a back seat to the citrus and pine notes. You certainly get some dank notes on this one, but its not too bad.   Taste is a refreshing and crisp array of flavors. From the pine and sappy like flavors to the orange, grapefruit and hints of mango, the flavors are strong and distinct. Some prickly carbonation initially provides some punch to the flavors, but that quickly gives way to a bitter pine finish.   Mouthfeel has some prickly carbonation initially. There is an oily feel to the beer, with some sappy bitterness that coats the mouth.   Overall a phenomenal IPA from Surly.

Peche 'n Brett,"Tried this through a trade my brother made,  There is very little sour and even tart qualities. A very overrrated beer that has decent qualities but very little peach flavor and is by no means a sour. I should have known after trying the saison brett by Logsdon.   Overrated to say the least. Very unimpressed. The aftertaste has a mediocre lager taste I try to extinguish with the next sip. I hope you didn't sacrifice too much for this lil bro.",0.563633953643005,3.25,-0.359

Somewhat reminiscent of a Pliny, etc. Clearly remains an outstanding beer but now the bitterness and dank quality seem overstated. The creamy deep maltiness has a slight bit of a cloying and syrup. 10 years ago I would have marveled... now it seems somewhat pushy even a bit harsh in the aftertaste.

I have never smelled a beer this bad and I love funky lambics. This was not cheesy, it was not barnyard, it was not even horse-piss. This was rancid and putrid garbage. I think this was the worst beer I have ever smelled. The beer looked good, it was a cloudy reddish color. The taste was oddly pretty good despite the vomit and trash smell. I tasted funky lambic and raspberries like I expected. This was alsoa little more acidic that I would like but the smell is what killed the experience.

Peppermint and distant tropical fruit clash in the nose.   Cantaloupe and papaya show up front in the taste. A peppery bite lingers on the tongue in the aftertaste, as does a muted fruit and herb combo.  Heavy bodied and fairly creamy, with a relatively still feel.   (Reading their description, they call what I picked up as peppermint ""lime zest."" Fair enough; I get that now. It's a peppery zing not often found in beers.)

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Draft at DLD. Served dark as night with only a slight ring of head around the perimeter of the glass. Smell is absolutley luxurious. Deep roasted malts, chocolate, and bourbon are the front runners. This is a big beer, no doubt, the alcohol is there and warming. This beer is mellowed a bit by the oak aging. Not the brute that the DL bottle is. This is a great beer, but not huge and robust as say a GI BCS. The guys at FFF have taken barrel aging to a whole nother level. Other brewers could take notes from them.",0.6155226011882863,4.5,-0.5419
Chocolate Rain,"The beer was poured from a bottle into the glass. It looks really dark and nice. It also smells good: very complex. However, I did not like the taste. Not balanced, too sweet and it also did not taste like 'beer' at all. The beer is also very heavy, a very dominant alcohol and sweet chocolate taste.

Blanc De Blancs,"The beer pours a dull sunset like golden yellow with no head, visible carbonation, and (with some careful pouring) no sediment. The nose has a slightly floral/vanilla grain & barrel sweetness, surprisingly limited tartness, underlying grape notes, and minimal funk/acetone. It has a mild, champagne-like grape taste upfront with grain rounding out profile and lingering alcohol and oak. The beer has a light-medium body, but is not as crushable as expected (mainly due to the alcohol content) and a slightly chewy sweetness. Carbonation is relatively low and acidity is lower than expected - the beer still finishes with that punishing dry oak slap in the palate. The beer's so limited and expensive that I'd probably avoid purchasing it again in the future (or at least my full allotment), but it's undeniably delicious.",0.6997091313816105,4.25,-0.5574

White coconut floaters were a bit unexpected.  Nose was more subtle than the flavor, barrel notes (oak, bourbon ), coconut,, chocolate.  The flavor is where this beer shines, barrel (bourbon, oak, vanilla), coconut, chocolate. The barrel and coconut flavors are nicely balanced, with the bourbon stepping forward but staying complementary.  The feel is full bodied and creamy..  The price point is high on this beer.

The body is neutral with a corresponding carbonation level.   Imagine a horror film that features 90 minutes of violence in a 92 minute film. This a bit like that.

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"750ml capped and corked bottle, 2007 vintage, nice pastoral European town square imagery on the label.  This beer pours a rather glassy, yet radiant dark red cherry amber hue, with two fingers of loosely foamy, and generally bubbly diluted pink head, which leaves a broadly spaced spread of thin soap scum lace around the glass as it quickly and evenly settles.  It smells quite pungent - the aroma jumps out at you at first with sour, fruity acetic acid - could be lemon, could be raspberry, though the vinegar base is hard to dismiss, with a strong sense of mildly funky barnyard yeast, a mixed berry jam sweetness duly following up, and a further earthy mustiness bookending the extremes. The taste is strong, tart, sour fruit - lemon and underripe raspberry again the obvious suspects, making one's head almost involuntarily shake, before suggestions of musty basement, tannic oak barrel, a soft, actually somewhat sweet pale graininess, and earthy, subtly funky yeast arrive a little less than promptly on the scene, to no ill effect.  The carbonation is indeed there, but sedate in its moderately frothy ramblings, the body on the light side of medium weight, and astringent as an ex-girlfriend's personality assassination in terms of its smoothness assessment. It finishes with a tart 'n fruity 'n funky re-assertion, bringing the nose 'round full circle. How very zen.  A lambic with an inherent tartness that is so full, and yet blended, that I can't really apologize for the difficulty in readily discerning other flavours, i.e. the fruit, which is generally more inferred, than directly tasted. If I wasn't such a fan of sour, spicy, and/or tart characteristics, I don't think I could see how this offering might score so high. However, I am, and it surely does.",0.6973246216199339,4.5,-0.6393

T: Lots of tropical fruity hops, along with that cat pee and white wine sensation again. Spicy rye noted towards the back end. Lingering lemony bitterness competing with the white wine taste and a touch of pine finishes it off. Heat from the 7% ABV is felt in the belly but not noted on the palate.   M: Medium in heft, with a slight oiliness to the feel. Carbonation is muted.   O: Not really impressed with this one - I think the hop profile just isn't in my ""wheelhouse"" (I tend towards the C-hops and what I guess are now the ""traditional"" American Pale Ales' and IPAs' flavor profiles.)

Sip Of Sunshine,"This beer gets hyped up so much, and boy did it fail to live up to the hype. Sure it's a good beer. But calling it world class is a load of garbage. Just your classic ipa, bitter hint of citrus but just not too interesting. Definitely not warranting of the top rating it gets.   Immediately upon opening I notices the smell wasn't anything to write home about, bringing the subtle citrus notes but again nothing significant. Body felt really light and the citrus in there wasn't as significant as I thought or as was touted. Good beer nowhere near the price and attention it gets.",0.6010663311779663,3.75,-0.7311

Dragonsaddle,"12oz can from recent release (11/15/2015), thanks Ryan!  Slightly hazy marmalade-colored elixir poured into DFH chalice. One finger, tight, white bubbles crown the brew with thick lacing from top to bottom.  One heck of a nose on this one: starts with some not so subtle dank pine, spice and with a light swirl of the chalice the tropical fruit explodes!  The flavors meld together, locked in a death grip on the tongue of pine, mango, grapefruit, tangerine, producing a smooth bitterness that lingers.  Medium body??? For a triple of such ABV, seems ridiculous, as if the brewers captured some new technique that created an amalgam of hoppy delights without the alcohol burn.  Hands down the best triple IPA I have ever tasted! Bang! There it is. Can't believe that I put that down but it's no doubt.",0.6742214288203829,5.0,-0.7475

Medium bodied with a crisp mouthfeel. Ripe tropical citrus on the palate with a fairly big bitterness. Dry and bitter with some faint malt to balance. Finishes with a sustaining bitterness, citrus pith, and faint pine.  Tasty enough but the hops in this one (especially the nose) are subdued.

Beatification,"Batch 5, bottled 10JAN12  Upon popping the cork and sticking my nose at the bottle neck, my initial response was to say aloud, while alone, ""Why the shit is this not a regular?! Get your shit together Vinnie.""  This is a crispy golden beer with a solid, fluffy, white cap and a resilient central emission of carb rises from the bottom. Lemon zest, manure, hay, arugula, horse hair, soil, yogurt and hell yeah emit from the aqueous solution. One of the most tart beers I've tasted, lemon juice, hints of bitterness, mud, weed roots, dandelion - this beer is insane.

The aromas were a bit more tame than the other Tree House DIPAs I have tried.  Flavor: tasted peach and oranges with hop bite at the finish. It's starts sweet and juicy but finishes with a slight gritty bitterness. But very balanced overall between the malt and hops.  Mouthfeel: medium bodied and smooth. Almost creamy. Quiet similar to those trending milkshake IPA's I have tasted.   Overall: not the best of the Tree House but still world class!

The taste starts with hop bitterness as malt, yeast and citrus rinds fill in the middle, almost semi-sweet. The finish features bitter hops and tangy citrus, dry and spicy.  Herbal hops return in the aftertaste plus pepper and a slight grassy bite.  Medium/light body and lively carbonation, not quite as rich and creamy as other TH beers.

Very GGGreennn,"Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass.  Pours an entirely opaque orange cream color with a finger of frothy white head. The retention is stupid, the head just sits there like an asshole refusing to leave. After about 45 minutes, the head finally dissolves into a thin sheet, leaving a wonderful crown of lacing along the way. This beer looks like an orange sorbet milkshake and it's ridiculous.  The aroma is equally stupid. Big notes of pineapple, candied orange, lemon meringue, and grapefruit. There's also plenty of orange creamsicle and peach rings before a wave of honeydew melon. Subtly herbaceous and dank on the back end. A lot like Green, if Green took a shot of HGH in the butt.  The flavor is the stupidest thing I've ever tasted. Orange creamsicle, pineapple, grapefruit, and tangerine lead the way. Then comes a massive wave of melon, lemon meringue pie, and sweet, doughy malt. Finishes herbaceous with a subtle yet biting pine note.   The feel is medium-full bodied with soft carbonation. Thick as balls, chewy, and creamy. The alcohol is subtly present, with a lingering hop burn on the finish.  Overall, dammit Tree House. Just dammit. I am NOT a trader. I've never traded a beer in my life. Nor am I a reseller. I buy these beers and drink them at home naked. I have no ulterior motive here. This beer is just stupid. Absolutely idiotic. You know how Trillium has Headroom and everyone talks about how hoppy it is? This is Tree House's Headroom, and it's dialed up to 11.

Palate is pretty much flattened. Cola thick flat juice of earth and a lifeless limp body. Dead carbonation, with depth of malt and a bunch of lively hops that are just left to hang.

Todd The Axe Man,"What a great New Beer Sunday (Week 656)! I warmed up/tuned up during the Viqueens/Stillers game today with several Surly beers that I had previously reviewed, but once I got up a good head of steam, The CANQuest (tm) kicked into gear & I really began to have a good time.   From the CAN: ""Beer to Shred Your Face, In a CAN""; ""Fresh Beer, Drink It Now""; ""The Axe Man Cometh""; ""Amager Brewery n Denmark named this beer after our head brewer and metal guitarist, Todd Haug. They collaborated to make an IPA with hop character as intense as a thrash metal guitar. Golden Promise Malt provides a blastbeat background to the screaming citrus noted created by overdriven amounts of Citra and Mosaic hops. Pour this in a tulip glass and let the aromas and flavors assault your senses.""; ""Artwork by Simon Hartvig Daugaard"".  Upon Crack!ing the CAN open, it revealed a brimful craft CAN. Oh my! This, coupled with the fact that it was a 16-fl. oz. CAN, led me to CANduct a slow, gentle Glug into the awaiting glass. It foamed a bit of its own accord, but an in-glass swirl raised two fingers of foamy, soapy, tawny head with decent retention that left behind nice sticky lacing. Color was a solid Amber (SRM = > 7, < 9) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was an onslaught of piney, resinous hops backed up with caramel malts. Phew! Was this a DIPA? Warming, tropical fruit notes began to join the party, but it still smelled like a DIPA. Mouthfeel was full, thick & creamy, like a dollop had been ladled onto my tongue. It felt dangerously close to a DIPA. The taste was riotous with everything from pine resin to caramel to papaya, mango and guava plus coconut (like it was Bourbon Bbl.-aged) as well as some fusel alcohol heat. Whew! This was no playing around. Double phew! I was starting to feel as though an axe had been taken to my skull. They CAN call this an AIPA all that they want, but it drank like a DIPA, IMHO. It burned in my sinus cavity, it ripped & stripped its way across my poor, bruised tongue, taking no prisoners & laying waste to any weak or dead taste buds in its path. It even set off a fiery acidic path in my esophagus that I had not felt in a while. Finish was hot, dry & dangerous. There is no other way to quantify this bad boy.",0.6329090159013203,4.25,-0.8521

What a booze bomb, not just on the nose, but also the taste. The predominant flavor and aroma is harsh alcohol phenols that overtake anything pleasant about the beer.

How can you go wrong? Either my palate is broken due to the abundance of IPAs I've had lately, or something seems a little off.

I was hoping my last bottle was fucked so i tried it again, guess not. this beer is over rated simply because it has the word peche.   i will never buy this again and will avoid their other beers.",0.5030542364939555,1.75,-0.9863
