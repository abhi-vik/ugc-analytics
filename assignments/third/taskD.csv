Peche 'n Brett,"E: Beeswax coated pry-off crown cap. Purchased at a bodega in Brooklyn for a wallet-annihilating $40.00 USD. 1 pint 9.4 fl oz brown glass. Orange colourful label art. Bottle #20020. Best by 10/2020. ' 10% ABV. ""Oak aged organic ale brewed with peaches."" Brewed with peaches and brettanomyces. ""Final refermentation with pear juice.""  Expectations are extremely high given my love for the brewery and this beer's presence on the top 250 beers list.  HEAD: ~3 fingers worth of white head. Frothy, creamy, gorgeously soft, and of great complexion. Consistency is terrific. Retention is excellent - ~8+ minutes.  BODY: Pale murky orange of okay vibrance. I see no yeast or sediment within, but it definitely appears unfiltered.  Appears well-carbonated. It's a nice looking beer and captures the lively unfiltered look of a great saison, but I can't say the vibrance of the body colour is on par with that of the best expressions of the style.  AROMA: Soft orchard peaches, orange sherbert, soft juicy pear, creamy notes, pale malts. The soft luscious peach is impeccable, elevating this aroma easily to world class level. Promises a juicy peachy genuine brew with absurd depth and expressiveness of flavour.  Any oak is too subdued to be noticeable. Sweetness/bitterness balance seems perfect. Nectary juicy goodness is the highlight of this aroma; I'm salivating just awaiting the first sip.  Aromatic intensity is perfect (mild to moderate).  No overt hop notes; maybe some seamless fruity tones. Yeast character has an incredibly subtle funky bend without distracting. As soft and delicate an aroma as they come.  No off-notes or overt alcohol.  TASTE & TEXTURE: Creamy soft peach, smacky lactic tartness (was the brettanomyces used lambicus? This is straight-up sour), evocative expressive orchard peach, soft juicy luscious pear, subtle yeasty dryness (bringing just enough to coax more depth of flavour out of this brew without making it drag on the palate), and creamy peach sherbert.  Hides its 10% ABV angelically well, hiding any alcohol beneath layers of billowing softness. Couldn't be more delicate or gentle on the palate. Perfectly smacky on the palate, making the slight tart sourness sing. Comfortingly soft. This mouthfeel may be perfect; rarely do I encounter such harmony of softness, fragility, and body. It's so light it's insanely drinkable, it's aptly smooth and wet, and carbonation is perfect.  Malt backbone melts into the dominant fruity tones, letting them take the spotlight. This is as gestalt a flavour profile as I've ever encountered, blending every constituent note together in a layered cohesive way, elevating the whole above the sum of its parts. The peach sings.   Noticeable acidity.  Sourness is maybe a 4/10, which is ideal for a saison in my view. It lacks any drying funkiness, and there aren't too many fruity esters mucking with the fruity focus of the brew. Balance is perfect. Depth of flavour is excellent. Duration of flavour is high for the style. Intensity of flavour is moderate. I can't get enough of this stuff.  OVERALL: Logsdon outdoes themselves with this stellar brew. This is possibly the best saison I've had from any brewery in North America, and I can't vet its quality enough. It's earned its position on the current top 250 list, and I'd heartily recommend it to any discerning drinker - even at its seemingly obscene $40/bottle price. When I think of true perfection in terms of texture, this beer will be amongst the first to pop into my head. Its juicy softness accentuates the peach emphasis of the brew beautifully. Awingly good - ineffably so. Just fuckingly delicious. I find myself inhaling this and simultaneously being shocked by its 10% - how is this so effortlessly drinkable at that high an ABV?  Nitpicky as I am with great beers, I have to admit I struggle to find many issues with this aside from petty things like appearance. At a certain point, excellence becomes undeniable.  This is what we talk about when we talk about beer as art.  Low A+ (4.71) / MUST TRY (WORLD CLASS)  *** 07.26.17 2nd impressions from a batch # 27857 bottle:  Less sour/tart than the last bottle I tried. A little less balanced, with too much sweetness.

Society & Solitude #4,"Enjoyed on tap at Armsby Abbey in Worcester, MA.   A - Familiar HF hazy, golden, orangeish-yellow, straw color with three finger head with great lacing and retention. Beautiful.  S - Sweet, hoppy, fruit juice with some mellow tropical mango, pineapple balanced with sharp grapefruit citrus. pretty amazing. Hint of malt, but that's it.   T - Wow! wonderful flavor profile. You get fresh, juicy hop notes from orange & grapefruit to pineapple, mango and even banana! I've never tasted a banana like note -- delicious! Really nice balance of bitterness and sweetness throughout with a lingering finish. There is a slight pale malt presence, but easily outshined by the glorious hop juice!   M - Incredibly drinkable, especially with a medium to full body. Very robust, bursting with flavor. Great carbonation. Alcohol well hidden. As each sip lingered on the palate, it left great anticipation for the next.   O - Delicious and most enjoyable. Having sampled many of HF's DIPAs, I have perhaps even unrealistic expectations when I taste a new one. This beer delivered. It's high on the top favorites list for me. I enjoyed #4 more than either Double Citra or Double Galaxy on their own. A world class beer. So drinkable, fresh and refreshing, you could enjoy outside on a summer day, lazily passing conversation, pour after pour. Yet so equally delicious and interesting, you could savor each sip as if it were the last. I feel this is where Mr. Hill solves the Double IPA equation. Achieving the perfect combination of wonderfully interesting, unique and delicate flavor profiles that are equally as approachable, inviting, and drinkable. Well done.",0.7183094311019238,5.0,0.999
Sang Noir,"750ml brown glass bottle with appealing label design and unbranded hood-and-wire cap over a cork purchased from Cascade and served cold into a tulip in high altitude Castle Rock, Colorado.   Reviewed live as a sour ale per the label. Expectations are sky high; this is currently #91 on the Top 250 and Cascade is a wonderful brewery. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  No bubble show forms as it's poured.  HEAD: 2 fingers wide. Has one of the richest complexions I've ever seen. Bubbly. Fairly creamy. Decently thick. Retains very well - for ~10 minutes. Leaves no lacing on the sides as it recedes.  BODY: Dark rich sanguine red. Exquisite.  Appears well-carbonated. Looks exactly as it should.  AROMA: Subtle hints of vanilla and oak. Pie crust. Cherry pie. Sour cherries. I could use more tartness from the cherry, but it's nice as-is. Dampened oak. Cream.  A pleasant aroma of average strength. Sourness is mild - at best a 4/10 in terms of intensity. Seems sterile and clinical, and evokes only pure lactobacillus - no true wild or spontaneous bacteria (i.e. lambicus).  TASTE: Sour cherries dominate - and boy is the sourness and tartness ramped up compared to the aroma - easily a 7-8/10, with plenty of lactobacillus bacterial pucker. Oak is present throughout, lending it a guiding cohesion. A bit of subtle vanilla does come through, but no bourbon; I'd never pick up on any bourbon character if I tried this blind. Some vinegary characteristics. Toastiness. Barrel sugars.  The base beers were well-selected; I get some nice acetic character reminiscent of Rodenbach and rich red malt characteristics.  The cherry pie flavour is wonderful, and is the highlight of the beer for me.  Impeccably balanced. This tastes like a gestalt whole, but it's not without room for improvement: more sourness and tartness, richer white oak, and more of a true wild taste would help.  No alcohol or off-notes come through. A minority of drinkers may find the cherry slightly medicinal, but I love it.  TEXTURE: Full-bodied, surprisingly thick for a sour - evoking pie crust, smooth, wet, slightly overcarbonated, damp, oddly refreshing, and rich. It's smacky and acidic on the palate. To its credit, this is one of the few truly puckering beers I've had.  Not oily, gushed, hot, astringent, boozy, harsh, rough, or scratchy.  OVERALL: 9.5% ABV is high for a sour, but it's hardly noticeable here. I get too lost in the flavours to notice it. Great as this beer is, it isn't worth its high pricetag more than once. I'd recommend that every beer enthusiast try this once, but while excellent it isn't world-class, and it isn't substantially better than something like New Belgium's La Folie or Rodenbach's Grand Cru (offerings which are half the price of this one and much more widely available). The pie crust and sour cherry work together brilliantly, lending this fantastic brew some incredible harmony. But there's room for improvement still.  Low A-  --- 12.23.14: Truncated impressions:  Just a great overall beer. An incredible beer in the style with amazing sourness and a great overall flavour profile. Wonderfully acetic.

Green,"My dad showed up today. He's on a modified car circuit race team. Travels around New England. He brought me this little gem. 16oz.can with a coozy!!. He told me, the line of people waiting for canned take home pours was long.  (* Second can update. ""The action is Go !"" is the statement on the bottom of the can. Canned on: 11/10/17 opened, the next day 11/11/17. Update on notes =* slight update on 12/13 after bringing home many from the brewery. Bottom of can : "" Go see the volcanoes, Go see the rainforests"" 12/12/17 *** 3rd can update. 9/19/18. Opened on 9/28/18. Slight notes and adjustements.. )  Galaxy hops, man o man. Righteous hop. Herbal, dry earth, sweet fruity layers in both aroma and flavor. Reminds me very much of the mega complex Heady Topper. Seriously, the layers of flavor just keeps riding in. Giant, earthy, spicy, citric tropical blend of hop wonder!! The malt is also in perfect balance and very bold.  Seriously enjoyable quoff. Easier on the pallet, but Still, each gulp held something new. The hop/malt balance being in the Heady topper levels. Top shelf quality....what a sweet surprise. Thanks pops.   Balance is amazing and the drinkability is very high. Complexity is multi layered but easy breezy..... Tropical fruits but hig earthy tones as well. Major league complexity with multiple layers of flavor that just keeps coming!  I had never heard of this brewery until today. Sweet surprise. Massive enjoyment. Thanks pops!!/////  * 11/11/17 can : + 12/13/17 addition. A classic NE ipa look, muddy gold color but bright! , thick and creamy white foam, good lace and well retained. Very intricate, full civerage style lacing.   The aroma....dense fruity hops, big pine and spruce tree effect, pineapple and a very sweetp citrus/pineapple with earthy and interesting malty caramel sweetness aromatics underneath. The American and Australian hop variety combo sure gives off a wonderful, complex smell. Light mango, kiwi and starfruit way down deep.  The multi colored layers of hop complexity is mind blowing. The earthy, natural grassy tones are soooo green! The tropical and mild citrus, light and sweet , peppery malt....just goes on and on! Such a unique and fresh hop taste, only wet hop styles compare. This one has only been in the can for 24 hours, so its about as fresh and green as it gets. There are subtle notes of white wine, chardonnay, green apples and spruce tips.   The mouthfeel, the texture, the body....fresh, crisp, full, lush, smooth and juicy. Righteous all around. Greeeen is the color!! An American cult classic.  *** 9/28/18 review update:   I've realized, overtime that this is the ultimate New England IPA look. The white-hued haze to the otherwise golden color is bright but totally opaque.  The foam heady head, is creamy thick, pure white with about as much solid clumps of lace you can possibly obtain.   The nose is a thing of pure olfactory beauty. Sweetest mango>pine>cantalope>Whipped cream and bright citrus zest aroma has me convinced that Green holds the record for ""overall stankiest hop"" in a beer award.   The righteous texture and mouthfeel will blow you away! Crisp, healthy, smooth, creamy....it's so damn silky. Oooh lala!  Only Heady Topper can compare to the kind of flavor complexity, with infinate layers of hop depth and fine malty balance that Green always delivers.  Green transformed what the New England ipa style is. The bright but deep vibe, complex pine>citrus and earthy tones keeps you curious about every sip. Feelin' it !",0.7218905064301199,4.75,0.999
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2008 vintage purchased in Brussels from Bier Tempel.  Had to uncork with a bottle opener, but not due to a lack of pressure—the huge thunk as it opened almost perforated my eardrums.  Looks red, bright and very pleasant. Head foams up at the beginning, but then fizzed itself out so that only a thin ring of fine bubbling remains. Carbonation is gorgeously fine. Looks a great fruit lambic.  Nose is wonderfully and genuinely raspberry fresh. Plenty of tart fruit, a hint of sweetness and lots of genuine lambic acidity to give its basis. The fragrance of the fruit is very true and really lovely.  Taste has that classic Cantillon acidity: raw, cutting and tart, but the sweetness and fragrance of the raspberries gives a truly wonderful counterbalance. Still acidic and with a slightly strained bitterness on the finish, but everything else restrains and leavens it beautifully. Yes. This is a wonderful balance for a fruit lambic. Restrained, truly fragrantly fruity, balanced, but still raw and aggressive.  Yes, lovely. The fruit is just right in this one, and the Cantillon acidity is slightly more restrained. Gorgeous.",0.7268210165856349,4.5,0.9984
Vicinity,"750ml bottle, 06.14.16, tagged on the back, poured into a Trillium snifter glass.   The beer pours a hazy and cloudy peach color, golden hues with some orange tones with a soapy white head, only about a finger tall with moderate retention but nice lace. The aroma is wonderful, peaches, nectarines, apricots, beautiful bright pitted fruit with some mango, tangerine and some soft sweet, doughy malt and a nice mineral water presence. The flavors echo the nose so well, huge amounts of light stone fruits, tons of peach flavor, lychee is as advertised, soft white grape acidity, tangerine with some mango as well before a bit of citrus rind bitterness appears, light pine and some hop spice linger well with doughy malt sweetness and a lingering mineral water flavor. The mouthfeel is great, full bodied, coating, soft and smooth yet lively carbonation dances on the tongue with a quenching finish that is moderately dry.  Verdict: A beautiful DIPA from Trillium and a truly world class offering. Often their IPAs become too focused on one flavor, or are too bitter, or just overhopped, ruling out any balance or complexity, however, this is truly great. Complex, excellent balanced with an assertive malt backbone that offers just enough sweetness to keep the bitterness in check, but I just love how bright and delicate the flavors are. This is a really special beer.",0.7266231600759505,4.75,0.9984
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"12oz bottle poured into HF stemmed glass, split three ways. Huge, huge thanks to Josh (thebigredone) for sending this to me!  A- Pours a decently viscous dark slightly brown black, fairly opaque jet black in the glass with some light purplish brown along the edges, very thin mocha brown head forms that has decent retention and fades at a moderate pace to a flat top, leaves thin lacing that fades back into the glass.  S- Aromas of rich maple syrup, integrated bourbon, dark creamy chocolate, a bit of oak on the backend. Very sweet smelling, but very pleasant and retaining a nice balance. Definitely above average aroma strength.  T- Dark creamy chocolate, sweet/sugary maple syrup, balanced and integrated bourbon, faint hints of oak. Finishes with a strong, rich maple syrup presence with balanced bourbon, oak, coffee, and creamy chocolate. Easily one of the best finishes I've experienced from a beer.  M- Thick, viscous, creamy, very drinkable, incredibly smooth especially at a surprising 13%, only a faint presence of alcohol, fairly low carbonation but appropriate for style.  O- This beer definitely blew me away and is 100% worth the hype, possibly one of my favorite beers to date. There were a ton of strong, rich tastes coming out but it still retained a very nice balance and drinkability. I wish this was made on a regular basis and wasn't so rare so I could drink it all the time. I definitely recommend seeking this out especially if you like big, rich, balanced stouts.",0.7171149094284185,4.75,0.9981
Oude Geuze Vintage,"750ml bottle, 2008 vintage, poured into a Drie Fonteinen fountains tumbler glass. Enjoyed on 1.28.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal.  The beer pours a hazy and cloudy copper color, big foamy white head, good retention, great lace clings to the glass. The aroma is super frunky, excellent expression of that distinct Drie funk that is so earthy yet citrusy and complex, lightly floral and herbal notes come forward with oak, green aged hops with some soft wheaty grain. The aroma is super bright and delicate, a really excellent display of what Drie is capable of. The flavors are excellent as well, great funk, dry dirty leaves, musty oak, bright citrus and an excellent floral character lingers well with some soft grain. The mouthfeel is great, very lively and crisp that coats very well with a tart and dry finish.  Verdict: A stunning gueuze from Drie Fonteinen. Excellent complexity, beautiful expression of funk with tons of depth bringing out nuances of fruit, oak, spice and grassiness, really delicious and special stuff.",0.7320140226915101,4.5,0.9972
Vicinity,"Trillium Vicinity  A: Surprisingly, this NE IIPA from the kings of the style does not pour completely opaque, instead opting for only a slightly hazy, brilliant golden-orange color. Two-and-a-half fingers of meringue-like head sits atop and has really nice retention. Lacing is equally impressive. There are obvious particles floating within, bounced around by the lazy-yet-plentiful carbonation. Per style, it should really be a bit hazier, but otherwise this is perfect. 4.75/5  A: Mango, orange, papaya, tangerine, lime, pineapple, and peach all burst forth from the glass in constant waves. Underneath lies a weedy dankness and a little alcohol sweetness. No real malt aromas are noticeable, but the sheer complexity of the hops (and probably fruity ale yeast contributions) really makes this incredible. The alcohol presence seems a bit much for only 8%, however. 4.5/5  T: Plenty of the same tropical-heavy fruits of the aroma, plus a great and very welcome contribution of juicy and bitter red grapefruit. Melon shows up toward the end of the flavor with the dank and pithy bitterness, along with a little indiscriminate herbaceousness. Malt sweetness is unnoticeable since it blends imperceptibly with the hops and creates a wonderful juiciness. Again, there is an alcoholic note on the end that is slightly unwelcome due to the relatively low ABV and how well it is hidden in other beers of similar ABV; this is a minor gripe, however. 4.75/5  M: Medium, slick, soft, and creamy are all applicable terms here. Carbonation is natural and soft, perhaps a little on the low end but not at all in a bad way. Dryness is slight, leaving the finish somewhat sticky and syrupy, making the beer seem much bigger than it is. This may be a bit of a flaw, but it somehow does not seem as detrimental as it could be in other beers. 4.25/5  O: This is a fantastic IIPA from perhaps the best brewer of this style. While it is not perfect, it does approach that and belongs in the conversation for the best to come out of the movement. There is so much juicy complexity that it is almost overwhelming, and it is almost perfectly balanced with the dankness that shows up later. It is truly remarkable how well Trillium integrates the overt hoppiness with the malts in a way that they worth together rather than being somewhat separate entities as in some other NE IPAs. Equally remarkable is how they wring unique flavors out of very similar, Galaxy-dominated hop bills. Pair with The Wonder Years ""The Upsides"" for being awesome but not quite game-changing. 4.5/5",0.7211244624210242,4.5,0.9972
Coolship Red,"amazing brew here, as authentic a lambic as i have gotten from the united states, its sour, dry, funky, and unlike even some of the best belgian ones, it is beautifully carbonated. the use of raspberries here is lovely as well, not as intense as say an atrial rubicite, but used more elegantly and refined in a special way. the bright pink color of this is gorgeous, while the white head on it is fluffy and permanent, with a certain enticing character. it smells as good as any raspberry beer out there, tart from the fruit, but also very sour from the wild yeasts and critters, which manifest themselves in an acidic and lactic mouthwatering aroma. the flavor is sour beer first, raspberry next, but the fruit stays all the way through the finish and slings to the edges of my mouth as the rest of it is dried out completely. such a clean finish for a beer this flavorful. the yeast profile is amazing, as good as any, thats the point of this coolship project from what i understand, to make very authentic and delicious wild yeast ales, this is so punchy and juicy and sour and awesome, i wish they would distribute to colorado, what a gem this beer is. nearly flawless on the overall, i cant think of a single thing i would change.",0.7136746045755157,4.75,0.997
Todd The Axe Man,"Currently #108 on the Top 250 beers list.  CAN: 1 pint format. Aluminum. Standard pull-tab. Metal-inspired label design. Canned 01/27/17.  7.20% ABV. ""India pale ale."" Brewed with Citra and Mosaic hops.  Served cold into a tulip per the label's instructions.  HEAD: ~5-6cm in height. Frothy and creamy, with a soft yet robust consistency. Recedes within 8 minutes, leaving no lacing. I've seen frothier and fuller more inviting heads, but this is to style.  BODY: Nontransparent. No yeast/lees are visible within, but it does seem unfiltered. Translucent. Colour is a pale copper-orange.  Appears well-carbonated. Not a unique or special appearance for an IPA, but a generally appealing one.  AROMA: I don't think either citra or mosaic hops are particularly well showcased, with this lacking the fresh pungent citrus and blueberry you'd expect from those hops. It offers only mild aromas of both along with some oniony and floral aromatics. I guess some of the kids these days might refer to this aroma as ""dank"" given its suggestiveness of a coating, fruity, deeply flavoured hoppy brew, but I'd have to refrain myself.  If anything, onion is dominant in this aroma, bringing it more into line with a simcoe-hopped IPA than a citra or mosaic hopped expression of the style. Aromatic intensity is moderate.  TASTE & TEXTURE: More tropical in its fruit profile than classically citrusy, emphasizing mango and tangerine above classic orange or grapefruit. Oniony indeed; I'd guess this was brewed with simcoe in a blind tasting. Mosaic's signature subtle blueberry is absent here to its detriment, but I guess the Mosaic does contribute some of that less interesting tropical fruit flavour. Floral as well. The warm boozy pineapple I despise in IPAs does emerge here, unfortunately.  All hop bitterness is balanced nicely by the pale malt backbone, and I think I find some caramalt in there too.  A very coating medium-bodied mouthfeel emphasizes the onion. A more fresh zesty acidic texture would play better to the citrus. Could be softer and more oily. Smooth and wet, but not too refreshing. Overcarbonated. Not gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, harsh, rough, or scratchy.  The mouthfeel suits the taste well enough without elevating the beer as a whole. There's no ideal harmony of flavour, but this texture does the job and doesn't get in the way of the flavours.  Far from the most complex IPA out there, let alone within Surly's own impressive lineup. I'm not too thrilled with the hop profile, and that comes as a shock seeing as Citra and Mosaic are some of my favourite hop varietals.  OVERALL: Fails to deliver on its Citra and Mosaic hop premise as well as the best expressions of the style (and since those hops in particular are so popular as of late, it's an easy comparison to make). Even single hop Mosaic beers like Lone Pint's Yellow Rose easily exceed this in terms of quality, but regardless it's a drinkable enjoyable take on the style and I'll enjoy finishing the 4 pack I bought. As much as I adore Surly, I can't count this as amongst the best beers in the style, nor would I recommend it to friends over more widely available and more affordable go-to IPAs from the likes of Deschutes, Lagunitas, and others, but I'm glad I tried it once and I wouldn't mind trying it fresh on-draught. If it disappoints, that's only because we've come to expect the best from Surly...and they so often rise to the challenge.  C+ (3.25) / ABOVE AVERAGE",0.7207713121303361,3.25,0.9969
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Kbbs '14  Pours a viscous, motor oil black color, with a small dark brown head, soon collapsing to a tiny ring of lacing with some spider web in the middle of the glass. Leaves back a mix of tiny tubbles and an oily texture after swirling.  Although I opened this after more than a year of its release, the coffee is as dominant as it has been in fresh Mornin' Delight. In this though, the Bourbon adds to the complexity of the coffee, creating an unforseen richness of aromas on the nose, while maple syrup appears to be a bit muted. There is a luscious bakers chocolate quality in this, tying the oaken barrel and flowery, cold pressed coffee beautifully together, creating a spicy coffee bean decadence, amped up by a mix of molasses and syrup. Coffee itself has an earthen note to it, perfectly enhanced by the barrel, while vanilla blends into scorched malts, producing an intense, wood accompanied, spicy praline impression.  I cannot belive the mouthfeel on this is real. This is unbelievable smooth. Rich and creamy, while featuring one of the most intense tasting beers I've ever had. Its silkness remains throughout, soothing the warmer parts of the beer with whipped cream and just an unbelievable softness.  Tastes of fudge, earth and brownie batter right from the beginning, together with a sweet and bitter cold pressed coffee appearance, adding foremost a roasty quality to the taste. While the flavors evolve rapidly on the palate, its silk creaminess calmes the upcoming flavor onslaught, leaving everything enjoyable and detectable. Milk chocolate and cocoa nibs set on top of the outstanding creaminess, finding their counterpart in roasty malts and a genuine coffee bitterness, blending into earth. Has a hot peak, together with a flowery barrel dryness, while licorice and a rich chocolate coating, calm the well accentuated, spicy heat. Finishes surprisingly clean and soft, right after the short, burning glimpse, whipped cream works its magic, ensuring the beers world class mouthfeel, while complimenting its chocolate richness. Coates the tongue during the aftertaste, together with gently spiced vanilla and coconut bark, packing also a lingering dryness.  This beer is beautiful throughout, it is indeed perfect. What I loved most about Mornin' Delight was its outstanding mouthfeel, but this one puts it to shame, by revealing a chewy smoothness, I have never experienced before in a beer. Its taste features a certain ambivalence, on the one hand it drinks fairly easy, due to its unreal silkness, while on the other hand it packs an unbelievable flavor range with a perfectly nuanced intensity to it. Everything seems to be in perfect balance, while maple syrup gets partially replaced by the far more complex Bourbon barrel in comparison to the MD. I understand this beer is highly sought after, this time it is most certainly well deserved.",0.7180599094287211,5.0,0.9967
Scaled Up,"Canned 10/4/16. Consumed 10/10/16.  A: Beer comes in a medium gold color with medium-plus haze. About a finger of fluffy white head forms as it pours, bit it dissipates rapidly and fades to a thin ring of tiny bubbles within a minute. Not too much lacing on the glass.  S: Intensely aromatic. A true medley of tropical fruit, with pineapple, mango, blueberry, and peach at the forefront. There's a musty, overripe, almost rotten fruit character as well as an underlying dusty, earthy white grape note from the Nelson. I'd say that the Galaxy and Mosaic definitely dominate the aroma while the Nelson plays a very nice supporting role.   T: Follows the nose, but with a few additional and potent notes. I get a lot more citrus (sweet orange, grapefruit) up front; in fact, the citrus is actually the dominant flavor throughout the taste. Tropical fruits are still there, but much more restrained. Pineapple, mango, blueberry for sure. On the backend, that Nelson-y grape flavor really comes out, but it's a sweeter grape flavor than I'm used to from Nelson. The finish isn't nearly as dry as other Nelson-hopped beers I've had recently. The sweetness of the fruit flavors really carries through and makes for an incredibly balanced and satisfying aftertaste.  M: Medium-plus weight on the tongue with a really nice balance of bitterness and sweetness. There's a lingering sticky, almost candied dried fruit sweetness that coats the mouth, but the medium bitterness and white-wine-esque dryness keeps it far from being cloying. It's incredibly smooth for the ABV with a very textured (slightly chalky) yet still quite juicy feel. Not quite creamy, but very close.  O: This is a really good DIPA and an excellent showcase of three of my favorite hops. The aroma on this is HUGE, one of the most pungent and explosive that I've experienced in a while. The aromatic profile is rich and tropical with an perfect earthiness to complement the sweet, almost candied fruit notes. The flavor follows suit, but is less diverse and more heavily citric. As the beer warmed, I got a bit more alcohol on the taste and a slightly 'fusel' nail polish-y flavor, which was a bit unpleasant. It wasn't overpowering at all, but I definitely preferred this when it was cold vs. near cellar temp. Overall, this is a fantastic DIPA and one of my favorite Trillium beers yet.",0.713753115154619,4.5,0.9966
Enjoy By IPA,"(Enjoy by 4.20.17, purchased on 4/20 and chilled, consumed 4/21... poured into a tulip)  L: pale amber-gold liquid, mostly clear but with maybe a very slight haze... rocky, jiggly blanket of bright off-white foam, nice hold... a few jagged scars of crusty lace  S: orange pulp, sweet pepper, grapefruit oil... very soft, medicinal booze underneath, as well as some biscuity malt... maybe more than a hint of peach and a subtle overtone of old wool upholstery... nice little nuances, but intensity may have softened by the point  T: super citrusy up front, with a surprising degree of lightly toasty-roasty crystal malt poking out... spicy, peppery static in the middle of the palate... the malt stays nicely balanced with the bitter citrus of the hops in the aftertaste, but that could be due to the hop dynamics having softened by the final day... malt and spice goes almost snickerdoodle last two sips, mmm... bold flavors overall, though lacking any unique (hop) characteristics  F: at first, medium-light bodied and supple... softly oily residue with a lovely full-thorax warmth... excellent tongue squeezing bitterness long after each sip... the alcohol behaves itself - such expert execution... by the end, it's malt/hop nectar (filtered hermetically clean, however)... the balance is superb - maybe you could lay this down for awhile  O: the hop flavors are very conventionally west coast, but their depth, density, and intensity is fantastic... this might easily be their most flavorful, enjoyable hoppy pale (when young)... great marketing concept (drink by), though the 10-hop garbage still never does amount to anything interesting",0.721279926500545,4.5,0.9964

The off-white foam cap is rocky and bubbly, excellent retention with plenty of thin covering. Intricate and sticky lacing leftover's.  The hoppy aromatics are powerful! A pungent bouquet of dense and fresh smelling hops, very juicy, sweet tropicals, like strawberry and pineapple. Wet grass, dried leaves and multiple layers of fruits. Some slight peppery and boozy notes with a caramel like sweetness in the malt. This is easily one of the best smelling and aromatic Dipa's I've had the pleasure of sniffing.   The multiple dry hopping sessions sure give it an excellentl dry and crispy bite. The malt is very light and crisp with layers of dryness, earthiness and a peppery kick right at the end. A light to medium juicy body and texture surrounded by dryness. Light to medium bodied, juicy then dry texture finishing dry but very clean. Awesome feel!   The hop complexity in the flavor is straight magic. Dry-earthy, juicy-fruity, green veggies and crispy summertime leaves, black pepper bite and bitter-dry hop pellet, straight...no chaser! The leftover taste, the lingering green-grassy, fresh hop taste is crazy good. Deep hop complexity with a wide range of hoppy effects. The dry-earthy and fresh hop cone taste I love so much, grassy, earthy, fruity, bitter, juicy....I mean, it's all here!! The malt is light, grainy tones of dried wheat and slight caramel sweetness. Not a golden, pilsner style thing like many New England style's but a light and bright amber malt is more like it. Excellent balance in a fine supporting role to the mega-star hops. The depth and complexity of the hop flavor and overall affect is rather mind-blowing.   This monster Dipa plays NO ""second"" fiddle to anyone !",0.7273919037361779,4.75,0.9963
Aaron,"500ml bottle, batch #2, poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass. Enjoyed on 1.30.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal.  The beer pours a dark burgundy color, very opaque with a foamy off white head, bone colored that offers little retention and a few spots of soapy lace. The aroma is unbelievable, tons of caramel, stone fruits, brown sugar with rich grain, figs, smooth toffee forward bourbon with an oak barrel character that brings out a touch of acidity to counterbalance the richness with just a touch of hop. The flavors are wonderful and incredibly complex. Plenty of toffee, caramel, soft and sweet dark grain with a super layered bourbon profile, a touch of vanilla, a bit of spice with charred oak and a touch of acidity that brings out some stone fruits and a touch of boozy warmth lingers. The mouthfeel is great, coating and smooth, very full bodied with low carbonation, but just enough to prop the beer up with a warm and soft finish.  Verdict: A fantastic barleywine from Hill Farmstead, a truly special beer. The complexity is incredible, the balance is fantastic and the depth of flavor achieved is superb. One of the best barleywines I've ever had the pleasure of trying and one of the best beers at that.",0.7137585872818603,4.75,0.9961
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Pours a cloudy golden color with a huge, froth head.  Smells very promising and complex - the nose is filled with dried herbs, lemon zest and a note of orange juice, as well as white bread dough and wet hay. There is a cookie sweetness coming from the hay, which gets almost entirely swallowed by the tart lemon presence, but manages to cut through. A whiff of old basement, together with some wooden mold establish a fantastic counterpart to the bright fruitiness.  Has a soft and light mouthfeel, which got a well nuanced sparkly, mineralic carbonation to it, which becomes most present during the finish, lending a well deserved refreshing note to the beer.  Tastes of ripe wheat, which gets immediatly overpowered by tart lemon and juicy orange, together with a slowly evolving herb dryness of mint and oregano, which turns even more prominent in the finish. Maintains a very pleasant, mellow mouthfeel, which gets complimented by a sparkly, well dosed mineralic carbonation, adding to the dryness. Its cookie sweetness from the nose, together with some subtle blue cheese funk, create a wonderful complexity, which does not distract from the lemon at all.  That is an incredibly well made, complex and tasty beer, it is mindblowingly good. All aspects come together in perfect order, enriching each other, balanced by the fantastic mouthfeel.",0.7233718024658302,4.75,0.9961
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Drank on-tap at Dark Lord Day 2009 Served in a plastic cup  The beer poured super thick and dense, like used motor oil. Not a ray of light penetrated this sludgy mass. A small, frothy, clingy, coffee-colored head capped the liquid.  The aroma was simply amazing. Sweet, robust and complex with strong indications of oak and bourbon. Lots of vanilla-like sweetness. Some brown sugar and caramel notes appeared as well. Boozy without being overly alcoholic.  The taste was just as astounding as the smell. Sweet, rich malts came through strong up front. Coffee-like. Deep and dark yet super smooth and not overly roasty. Bourbon and molasses were also noticeable. Lots of vanilla and oak too. Dark fruits appeared in the center. The lingering finish was oaky and whiskey-like. Brown sugar notes were apparent. Overall, incredibly interesting and quite complex.  The mouthfeel was ridiculously good. Ultra-heavy and creamy with a fine, mild carbonation. If there is a more rich and dense brew out there, I have yet to try it.  Drinkability was simply off the charts. The beer was incredibly smooth and balanced. Sweet for the style without being cloying. At 15% ABV, it drank like something half its strength.  This beer alone made my 1,000 mile journey to Dark Lord Day 2009 worth it. Simply put, Oak Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout is the best beer to ever pass my lips.",0.7122448659881869,5.0,0.996
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2012 sticker date. Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Cantillon stemmed lambic glass. Allowed to warm to just under room temperature over 3 hours.   Pours a maroon body with a pretty big, 3 finger light pink, fizzy head that dissipates pretty quickly to leave no retention or lacing.   Wow.. the aromas on this baby are mesmerizing - a huge wave of fresh raspberries fills the air. So much fruit here. Light funk and oak on the aromas but fresh, bright berries dominate.   On the tongue, it starts with fresh, sour raspberry juice notes.. really delicate but pronounced. This gives way to a good amount of oak, lactic sourness, earthy light funk, finishing crisp, clean, acidic, tannic almost. Ever so slightly sweet. Mouthfeel is fantastic - medium carbonation, and medium light, easy drinking body.   I can see why the Lou Pepe series is sought after, these beers are true masterpieces. I wouldn't say this beer is overly COMPLEX, being pretty fresh the berries dominate, but that's exactly why it's so great. World class.",0.7107579799270385,4.75,0.9959
Flora - Blueberry,"First review in months. Been slacking, but I figured Blueberry Flora was a good time to start up again.   Pours a radiant dark blush purple, gorgeous fizzy head tinged with color highlights of the brew itself. Head settles quickly and leaves a beer much in common with a Shiraz in appearance.    Aroma is big wine barrel presence, raspberry much in the framboise nature, blueberry jam, oak, and soft vanilla. Big, juicy, bright nose on this. Most barrel I've had in my nostrils from Hill Farmstead.   Taste reveals another beautifully balanced masterpiece by Shaun. The fruit is front and center giving way to dried blueberries, raspberry skin, grape sweetness, and some wine grape tannins. The woodsy oak and vanilla add depth while base flora flavors come through giving off some flower notes and a more tropical type of fruit vibe.    Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lower carbonation level, and the lowest end I've encountered from the brewer. But there is enough to prickle the taste buds and help clean the fruity flavors away. Tart but not super sour much to my liking.    Overall a brilliant brew that has so much in common with fresh lambic krieks and framboise. Balance, raw fruit nature, subtle funk, and lovely oak properties to round out and perpetuate complexity. But the wine barrel elevates this to the level of Lou Pepes vs standard fruit lambics. Don't get me wrong, this is unique in every way possible and the lambic connection is really only meant to be taken with a grain of salt. It's the depth which makes me relate this to the fruited lambic realm. Highly recommended, will go down in the books as one of those memorable drinking experiences.",0.7143431102962619,4.75,0.9959
Beer:Barrel:Time,"It poured a super thick and viscous in the glass, pitch black color with very little head. Very little carbonation. The smell is sweet with tons of fudge interlace with bourbon and oak. Not complex by any means but so balance, sweet and rich. The flavor profile is just the same - so much rich chocolate fudge in the mouth balanced out with the warming touch of bourbon. Its sweet with a lot of depth that includes dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, and bourbon; all the things you would dream of in a barrel aged stout. The mouthfeel is thick and rich without much warmth for a 15% ABV beer. Overall: this is a superb beer, well remarkable for its balance of flavors, its depth of flavors and the thickness. Some may say its overrated because its not too different from other easy to obtain stouts. I have to disagree, it is well perfected with its sweetness, balance and the bourbon.",0.7179023636143038,4.75,0.9954
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2010 vintage served in a Cantillon lambic glass  Appearance: Pours a bright ruby red with hints of purple. Less than a finger of a light pink head dissipates quickly to a collar. Body is somewhat clear with light visible carbonation streaming throughout the glass.  Smell: Huge fresh raspberries, oak, hay, barnyard funk, green apple, vinegar acidity. Light musty character present as well and intensifies as the beer warms, but probably still a little lighter than a typical Cantillon.  Taste: Tart juicy raspberries, basement, oak tannins. Hugely tart, almost mouth puckering, tart finish.   Mouthfeel: Light bodied, with low/medium levels of spritzy carbonation. Super smooth and drinkable. Nearly perfect.  Overall: Not surprisingly, this is another winner from Cantillon. Huge fresh, jammy raspberry with tartness and funk that are strong enough to add additional complexity without overwhelming the fruit character. Best raspberry lambic, and possibly best fruit lambic of any kind that I've had. Definitely worth seeking out.",0.7119406790554929,4.5,0.9953
Green,"Okay, now this is a tasty IPA but a bit odd as it's got a lot tropical notes but they pair better with the hops than the Julius does. This was kegged on September, 27, 2016.  The color is hazy goldenrod with a nice yellowish white head that has great retention and lacing.  The nose is that of orange, pineapple and a floral bouquet. Citrus heavy, though and smelling like you about drink Sunny-D. Very interesting nose It could use more character in the floral hop arena in my opinion but a nice nose nonetheless.  Well balanced flavor however, like the nose, still not traditional. The citrus fruit is strong but is equaled by the hope character giving it a strong grapefruit flavor. Orange and pineapple at the start but a strong grapefruit finish. Slight hints of pine.  Mouthfeel is perfect for this style. The right balance of body and carbonation. The body is Light-Medium with crisp carbonation making it a very drinkable IPA.  Overall, I would drink this beer... when I'm in a tropical mood.",0.719832042470095,4.75,0.9953
Schaerbeekse Kriek,"From a 750 ml bottle to a tulip.   A-A normal pour produces very little head; just a thin pink cap that fades quickly to a collar. The beer is raspberry in color and slightly cloudy. Nothing spectacular to look at, but it suits the style.  S-The aroma on this older (2011) bottle is subdued compared to some lambics, but I still smell a good bit of sour cherry. Other scents include champagne, cider vinegar, and a light dose of earthy, barnyard funk. Acidity is moderate to low for the style.  T-The taste is flush with clean acidity, as well as some mostly-dry oaky funk, and more of that lovely sweet/sour cherry taste. It is very balanced and impresses with its focus rather than outright sourness or fruit flavors.  M-The feel is slightly heavier than some lambic style beers with an assertive but smooth carbonation that really compliments the flavor. Perhaps the best ""feeling"" lambic I have ever had.  O-What a great beer. It sounds stupid, but the smell and flavor are so simple and clean that the beer almost becomes more complex as I try to locate all the little subtle aromas and nuances that make this beer taste so good. Unlike some true Belgian lambics, I found this beer to be approachable, as well, i.e., not hugely sour or funky or hard to appreciate. The mouthfeel is also nearly perfect for the style.",0.7148379398263969,5.0,0.9951
Flora,"750ml bottle, Batch #6, poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass. Enjoyed on 7.4.15, reviewed from Tasting Journal.   The beer pours a nice golden apricot color, lemon hues, hazy and cloudy with a large, billowy and soapy white head, about 3 fingers high that has fantastic retention and lace. The aroma is wonderful, tart wheat, oaky acidic wine character, loads of wildflower, mineral water, citrus fruits, and light berry esters. The flavors are great, wheaty and doughy malt, tartness right up front, lightly citrusy, rustic wildflower, saison yeast, wine barrel that is both earthy and acidic, chewy oak sweetness and hearty mineral water. Loads going on, plenty of nice saison base that plays really, really well with the wine character. The mouthfeel is quite nice, coating, super smooth, gentle carbonation, creamy, delicate, delightful tart finish.   Verdict: Another fantastic saison from Hill Farmstead and yet another example of Shaun's prowess with utilizing wine barrels. Plenty of complexity, brightness, nice tartness, very delicate, so refreshing and easy to drink.",0.7133559871541394,4.5,0.9948
Society & Solitude #4,"d from a 750mL growler into a Hill Farmstead Stemmed balloon glass. Bottled yesterday at the brewery.  Pours a deep orange, hazy unfiltered body with a generous white head, reducing fairly quickly but leaving blotchy white lacing.   Bright, fresh, tropical aromas shine through the foam - pineapple, fresh citrus, raw hops, slight buttery aromas come through at times.   On the tongue is an explosion of fresh hops, a nice combination of juicy tropical fruits and delicious dank, resinous zing. Citrus, grapefruit, pineapple. Malt backbone is there -this makes for a nice, medium body with medium-low carbonation.   I didn't expect anything less from HF - where some of the best IPAs in the world are brewed. Perfectly balanced, super flavorful, and an absolute enjoyment to drink.",0.7114862519994654,4.5,0.9946
Flora - Blueberry,"Reviewed from notes from 7/27/14  A- Pours a deep glowing purple with a small light pink head that quickly recedes to a collar that leaves some nice lacing. Little legs of small bubbles climb to the top. Some blueberry sediment is seen in suspension. Super pretty!  S- Bright, tart citrus and blueberry burst from the glass! There is huge influence from the wine barrel, and a good amount of pleasant funk. Lemony tartness, a touch of wheat, and nice oaky tannins. Pleasantly yeasty, with a characteristic Brett aroma as well as lacto.  T- Tangy and tart, yet a bit restrained, not overdoing anything. The wine barrel and grape influence is noticeable throughout. Nice acidity, lightly sweet, but balanced by dryness and tartness. There is a distinct taste like the finishing taste of a blueberry. An utterly delightful saison!  M- The mouth feel is very dry, light to medium in body, and well carbonated.  O- Everything about this made for a delightful experience! It is super refreshing with all the bright citrusy and tart flavors, and the dryness just begs you to take another sip. Another Hill Farmstead masterpiece!",0.7116849020577518,4.5,0.9946
Thicket,"375ml bottle, generously shared by Erik, poured into a Side Project oversized wine glass. Enjoyed on 6.20.15, reviewed from Tasting Journal.   The beer pours a really nice purple/red color, opaque and hazy, really reminiscent of a blackberry with a slightly off white head, about a finger high that has nice retention and good lace. The aroma is welcoming, lots of blackberry, acidic red wine, hearty oak, funky yeast, lemon zest and tangy red grape linger well. The flavors are quite enjoyable, tart and fresh blackberry, juicy and jammy, red wine acidity, chewy oak, good funk, a little cheesy with a nice amount of mustiness, lemon zest cuts into the sourness a little, despite it's tart character, but offers some brightness and like the nose, lingering red grape and currants, fleshy and puckery. The mouthfeel is good, coating, zippy and lively with high carbonation levels, good dry tartness and an easy finish that has a crisp kick.   Verdict: A nice Wild Ale from Side Project, not overly sour, which I find to be a typical attribute with their fruited sours. Tart, acidic, balanced and a nice blackberry expression, not quite as epic and Fuzzy or Framboise du Fermier in terms of the representation of the fruit used, but very enjoyable nonetheless.",0.7163354062367575,4.0,0.9945
Scaled Up,"Pours an extremely murky bright orange color with a 1 finger white head. The head is gone quickly but there's some good lacing.   The aroma has plenty of orange and melon, with some more subtle notes of grass and pine. There's also a faint, peppery malt character present.   The taste is very sweet up front. I get orange, melon, and tangerine, as well as a bit of peach. The middle hides some bitter piney notes, but the end follows up with more candied-orange sweetness. A nice, fruity flavor, but a bit too much on the sweet side.   The feel is very creamy and smooth, with relatively low carbonation. A tad dry, but quite refreshing. Alcohol is very well hidden.   Overall, a very good DIPA that falls a bit short of other Trillium offerings. The tropical, juicy sweetness that defines a great New England IPA is very much present here, but there isn't much else to balance it out. The flavors are very good, but just a bit too sweet for my tastes. That said, I still enjoyed it quite a bit.",0.710092115327221,4.25,0.9944
Nelson,"Picked up a bomber at the Trig's Cellar 70 in Wausau. The ""best by"" date says this one is good for another month. Poured right from the fridge into my Founders pint glass.  L: Pours a bright straw color, quite hazy, with about an inch of eggshell head that has some nice longevity and leaves significant lacing on the glass. Lively, profuse visible carbonation present.  S: Big tropical fruit--pineapple and mango, predominantly--and floral hop notes in the nose. There's also some nice grassy and melon notes, along with cracked pepper and wheat. Not exactly an assertive nose, but it's very inviting.  T: Cracker and bready malts at the front, with just a touch of sweetness. The hops come in with a rush of floral and tropical flavor--distinct, refined, and assertive, without utterly overshadowing the malt bill. Toward the middle, the flavor gains a distinctive grassy and wheat/rye quality which plays off the floral and fruit hops remarkably well. There's some cracked pepper and more earthy undertones there, as well. The back end continues the juicy tropical fruit flavor and the ongoing floral and grassy notes. The close takes on a resinous pine/grapefruit rind bitter that lingers nicely on the palate in the aftertaste.  F: Lighter-bodied without feeling in any way watered down. Smooth and bright at the start, a bit creamy in the middle, and decidedly bitter at the close. Nice level of carbonation. The bitter keeps it from being especially sessionable, but it still goes back quite easy.  O: This is definitely a special beer, and it's one of the few IPAs that I find myself called back to on a regular basis. It's lively, yet extremely well-balanced. It's very flavorful but understated. I can count on both hands the number of IPA I've had that I'd consider truly great: Nelson absolutely has a place among them.",0.7313266020642258,4.5,0.9944
Oude Geuze Vintage,"750ml bottle of the 2007 vintage. Bottled 12/27/2007. Poured into a Drie Fonteinen stemmed glass 9/5/2014.  A- Beautiful hazy light copper-orange body. Three finger effervescent white head with great retention time. Not much lacing. [4.25]  S- As soon as the bottle is opened, the entire room was filled up by a citrusy funk. Very potent nose. Essentially, lemon zest, white wine grape must, musty cheese, oak, leather, funk. Incredible. This may very well be the best smelling geuze I've come across. [4.75]  F- Distinctly flavourful; very potent yet subtle. Tangerines, lemon zest, musty cheese, musty hay, oak, lather. Plenty of that signature Drie Fonteinen funk. Good amount of acidity but at the same time, it leaves your mouth wanting more. This is a true pleasure to drink in its complexity and power; especially when compared other sour beers in the same sitting- it is powerful, complex yet subtle enough that it does not overpower your palate and your drinking sensibilities. [4.75]  M- Medium body, perfectly carbonated- slightly prickly yet has a soft and billowy feel. The refreshingly dry citrus and oaky finish leaves you wanting more. [4.75]  O- I've not had the others, but the 2007 vintage is a clear home-run and deserves to be in the conversation with the other top lambics such as Lente and Zomer. Geuezes don't usually have a ton of variability in what flavours and aromas you can expect from them, but Armand seems to always find these barrels/blends where the best parts of the lambics are accentuated whilst minimizing the lesser aspects that might be there. World class. [4.75]  Final score: 4.725   Additional review: Oude Geuze Vintage 2012, 75cl cork and caged bottle, served in a 3F stemmed glass. Pours a medium orange-yellow body, one finger white head, excellent retention and lots of lacing. Picture perfect. Smell is sharp lemon, citrus, medium cheesy funk, moderate acetic acidity, oak, light mushroom, earth, touch of citrus rind. All kinds of things are going on here, and it's really something to behold. Flavour is phenomenal and just as complex as it smells; it softens slightly over time as it warms; a lot of lemon, citrus, and more damp oak and cheesy funk is apparent as the beer decants itself in the glass. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, crisp and moderately dry, yet very refreshing. It's intense but not to the point of mouthpuckering, but it has a ton of complexity and depth to it.",0.7214236277494237,4.75,0.9944
Flora - Blueberry,"2019 vintage.  This one pours a deep but clear red color, with a small head, and a lot of lacing.  I had heard that there was some smoky/plasticky off-flavors in this batch - luckily, it's just delicious funky blueberry goodness on the nose, with tart blueberry skin and juice, lemon, toasty oak, grassy funk, and a sort of minerality.  Some of the Flora variants kind of overwhelm the delicate and absolutely delicious Flora base. This does that less than normal, as you get that lemony/citrusy/grassy flavor still fairly strongly. The blueberry is expressed well, still, and strongly featured here, mostly tart and sour, but with a slight juicy sweetness.  This is light bodied, crisp, and pretty clean, with not lingering sourness on the back end. It's quite drinkable.  This is definitely near the top of the fruited Flora pantheon - it's really nice stuff.",0.7258681899055263,4.5,0.9943
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"I am very appreciative of Stakem for sharing this 2008 bottled in '10 with Kegatron and me. Enjoyed from a Cantillon tulip to match. My 1000th bottle review  This is exactly what I conjure up in my mind when I think of a raspberry lambic, just outstanding in color and is beautiful sitting in the glass like a gem in its resplendence with a beautiful rosy glow and tight ring after collapsing from 3 fingers, the bead is tiny with light pink lace. The smell is incredible, just so packed with strong fruity and funky odor w/ light floral notes that are still punchy and fresh. The nose is intensely raspberry with kmild hint of sour yeast odor. I love the feel as much as the aroma with huge lactic acidity which seems to enhance the mild sweet tart edges of the fruitiness. There is a pretty dry finish, but semi-sharp with dry/acidic qualities and extremely high carbonation like champagne.  This blitzes the palate and mouth with both fruity sweet taste and very intense sour lactic infused flavor. The acidity intensifies as the beer is held in the mouth but there is enough sweetness in the flavor to balance from the full fruity raspberry enhancement. The taste comes off almost as bitter/spicy from the carbonic acid the high carbonation level provides. There is a puckering, mouth drying quality w/ slight woodiness and extra tart raspberry juiciness as it finishes with some residual berry, but the funk and bacteria sour flavors linger into the dry end. Simply a wonderful fruit lambic, not many out there that are this complex and able to be savored in the way I found this to be. Intense yet drinkable a true classic, one of the best I have ever had.",0.7268962609782794,5.0,0.9942
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"a 2010 vintage generously shared with me after quite literally years of anticipating this bottle together. its incredible stuff, worth the wait, and as good as anything i have had from these guys really, every bit as good as the lou kriek or the fou. deep dusty brick red in color, dense with fruit here, not as electric and bright looking as a lot of raspberry beers, and with a fizzy lazy head, not super robust there. the nose is mind melting for me, pure raspberry and insanely mature lambic funk and tartness, turbid wheaty aged hop base, tons of oak and brett, a well developed wild acidity as well, this is rather piquant, and then of course all the berry, as natural as it gets and like stuffing an entire handful of them in my face, as intense as can be. i smell it for awhile before i taste it, so complex and mouthwatering and inviting. great sourness up front in the flavor highlights the fruit right from the start, with the sturdy wood and mature wildness right there with it, tart and red winey towards the finish, a little sweet from the fruit, still malty in a lambic sense, and really brightly acidic and interesting. the complexity of the yeast elements here is as good as it gets, and why cantillon is so well regarded as far as i am concerned. the raspberries are perfect with it, and really bold in this beer. the maturity is unrivaled and the flavor is just incredible. beautiful lambic, famous for a reason, and probably even more striking to me now in terms of quality because there are so many lackluster fruited sours out there in the world. this is the cream!",0.7115526518112419,4.75,0.9938
Sip Of Sunshine,"Canned on 8/8/18  I've tried this one plenty of times before, but finally had the chance to properly review...  Pours a beautiful honey-copper with two fingers of frothy, pillowy white head; decent head retention and plenty of lacing left behind to wall the glass; just a great-looking beer.  Aromas of honeyed grapefruit, earthy pine needles, dank mango peel; the balance of raw hop aromas present is so smooth, verging on almost naturally sweet, and displays excellently the evolving hops on the nose.  Taste is that familiar and smooth honeyed grapefruit along with balanced pine, dank mango notes, and the lightest hints of lemon peel; a bit of grainy malt, light peach skins, and hoppy grit are interspersed, as well. This is remarkable in its consistency from the aroma, and in its smoothness on the palate throughout.   Mouthfeel has everything going for it: smoothness, balance, perfect carbonation and a crisp, juicy finish; this is about as good as it gets.  Understandably a benchmark beer for the style; this has some truly incredible balance and consistency to it throughout, and is an eminently enjoyable drink under nearly any circumstance; it is similarly level-headed and brash, and deserving of its high esteem. A personal favorite for the style.",0.7501343823444264,4.5,0.9937
Mastermind,"12oz. can into a Hop Showers glass.   Pours a foamy, 2 finger white head with excellent retention. Beer is a crystal clear goldenrod. Lacing is layered and thick with great stick. An outstanding looking beer.   Nose has hints of lemon and citrus zest, pine, grass and pineapple. Tropical and juicy but overall pretty mellow.  Opens soft. Hints of papaya and pineapple fortified by a mellow malt body. Some citrus fruit in the middle with a bit of grass and pine in the back. Sweet and juicy end with a bit of a dry, resiny aftertaste. Pretty nice.   Medium bodied with moderate to low carbonation. Slick and quenching in the mouth and soft going down. Mellow finish with a dry, lingering, filmy aftertate. Excellent!   Great balance here and everything from the flavor to the look to the feel is above average. Worth trying but I don't know if its so much better than all the other outstanding offerings in the style that I'd go out of my way for it.",0.7124699841850602,4.25,0.9936
Sip Of Sunshine,"16 oz can packaged 9/16/2016.  Served chilled into a goblet glass, Sip of Sunshine is a slightly hazy golden yellow orange color. The head is thin and settles quickly but leaves some spotty lace.  Aroma is fresh and citrusy with great orange and grapefruit coming through nicely. Also some floral and tropical fruit notes.  Flavor is sweet up front with honey and orange juice. The hop bitterness comes in from middle to end with grapefruit primarily and pine in the background. The flavors play well together and give good balance between sweetness and bitter citrus.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and perfectly carbonated. Very drinkable and impressively balanced for a double IPA.  Overall a fantastic example of an east coast DIPA and I'm very happy to see it in Colorado if even just for GABF 2016.",0.7214154945271054,4.5,0.9935
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"On tap at Nova Res Cafe in Portland. Served in a bowl-ish Pinot wine glass.  Very streamlined presentation in the wine glass. Body is light raspberry red - almost glistening with a fair amount of pinkish or rose carbonation. Head is rather minimalist. Just what the doctor ordered.  Beautifully funky scent of sour, unsweetened raspberries mixed with a great Brett-ish funk. Not so heavy on the blunt horse blanket scent but more of a light poignancy with a little pine thrown in.  Taste profile is extremely clean. The tight sourness mixes nicely with raspberry essence to produce a beautiful lambic here. Finish is still very tight from piney texture and barrel character - almost as dry as balsa wood, but this is one of the classics.  Palate feel makes one pucker. Of course the sourness is overwhelming but it's done in a very clean and tight manner and doesn't negate the light dry sweetness of the raspberries. This one has a great deal of spring in its step.  I've taken a shine to the Cantillon lambics on tap ever since experiencing Fou Fonne at Deep Ellum. This one is just as enjoyable - maybe even a little more fruit character. Sure, it's tight and the funk and acidity slow it down a little bit, but who's to argue that this isn't one of the best?",0.7167811577979677,4.0,0.9929
Sip Of Sunshine,"Picked up in VT, was canned almost exactly two weeks prior to purchase given date on bottom, enjoyed same day.  Poured into a glass, fairly translucent golden amber yellow colour. Slightly opaque, holding the glass up to the lamp, can see plenty of fine particulates in suspension; unfiltered, like other fine VT IPAs. Nice white, foamy cap of frothy head. Good lacing.  Aroma is wonderful: citrus, slightly piney/resinous quality, mango, lots of fresh hops. I don't notice as much of the floral scent, but that's just me. Very clean.  Clean, crisp blast of citrusy goodness, some tropical fruit character, perfect level of hopping -- initially fruity, then smoothly bitter, then a bit of maltiness (not cloying at all), then a long pleasant lingering bitterness in the finish. This is one smooth and incredibly well-balanced beer. Seems like a bit more going on than most DIPAs I've had. Just enough carbonation to add a little lift to the moderate body. Even the can looks neat and unique.  SoS and Focal Banger are my two all-time favourite Vermont IPAs. This one is slightly mellower but loaded with flavour and a superbly crafted beer. It really is as wonderful as the reviews suggest, just wish availability was slightly better.",0.7204848065851842,4.75,0.9928
Green,"Canned on 6/21/18  Pours a totally hazy light gold with a nice off-white head; the lacing displays like a modern art gala, and really never disappears.  The aroma is striking but clean, with notes of prickly aloe and other herbs at the forefront. These are quickly followed by a nuanced barrage of overripe mango, fresh oranges, and dank, fresh-cut grass to soften it all out.  Bits of prickly earth continue on through the taste, as I'm getting very light black pepper and a nice variety of herbal hop notes. A juicyness bursts cleverly through the earthy notes, finishing on a high of mango and orange that is inherently refreshing while never abandoning the herbal undertones.  Mouthfeel is brilliantly carbonated and maintains a level of 'fluff to it that's near perfect, but also possesses a touch of dryness that really brings it to a new level; the flavor stays intact, leaving the finish crisp and refined.  Such a well-made brew, and a great first impression of Tree House. Felt the need to sit back and really gather my thoughts for this one, as I wanted to avoid reflecting with fresh hype; ultimately, it's difficult to ignore the pillowy mouthfeel, defined, well-executed flavors, and supreme drinkability of Green. This is good beer, and it leaves me excited to see more of what TH has to offer.",0.7290925953605876,4.5,0.9925
Sang Noir,"2014 project. I think I got this as a gift from my brother in law. This is the first higher-strength beer I've ever had from Cascade, whose brews are always good but never quite so good as to warrant their price.  Cork comes out very easily and the beer pours with precious little carbonation. Pours very dark and still, resembling a flat oud bruin.   Smells tart and bourbony, with bacterial sour cherry nodes smoothed out by oaky vanilla. Not picking up anything vinous, but overall it's a nice aroma with great balance and decent complexity.  The flavor is more complex, and rather more tart. Bracingly acidic yeast starts things out, which is still a bit of a kick in the teeth even after 2+ years of aging. The middle is fruitier, with strong notes of sour fruit and lively red wine. The vanilla oakiness of the aroma is only present here at the very end of the sip and in the aftertaste, with the finish serving as a firm, if indirect, balance to the bracing start.  Overall, a beer of high character and complexity. One of the better truly puckerking sours I've come across in quite some time.",0.7160162031897064,4.5,0.9921
Sip Of Sunshine,"Pours a mostly clear albeit cloudy orange color. Bright and bronzed. Thin velvety white foamy head dissipates somewhat but never completely.   Bright aromas of orange, grapefruit, pine, and a strong malty backbone on the aroma.   Taste follows the nose with immediate notes of orange, orange rind, pine, sap, and grapefruit giving way to a strong malty backbone with caramel notes. Strong piney bitterness starts on the back end and lingers into the finish.   Feel is medium bodied, but not too heavy. Somewhat oily, smooth and slick. Moderate yet bright carbonation. This feel is really perfect for a DIPA.   Overall, a lovely DIPA that does live up to its reputation as an outstanding example of the style.",0.7212026524427377,4.25,0.9921
Vicinity,"Pint can. Canned on 11/20/17. Opened on 12/6/17  Poyrs out of the can a totally opaque straw gokd with white light and orange hues within. A light drifting, white foam builds up high, dissipates fast to a thin bubbly cover and soft ring around the edge.  The nose is full of intense and fresh smelling hops. Tropical fruits, mellon, pineapple, starfruit, sweet orange. Earthy herbs and funky, wet-earth edge to tge hops makes it bold and very complex. A light, raw honey smell comes from the light, pilsner and wheat style malted barley. Sweetly floral and lemmon zest roybds it out.   I must comment on the mouthfeel and body texture.....soft, crispy, light, but smooth and full....all in one sip...did I mention a dry, earthy bite with the first hit and then again in the finish?! Wow. Boom. A solid, thick and heady body leads to a rather fascinating moythfeel overall. Impressive and classicly New England stylie.   The flavor:.... Certainly dominated by a fresh, earthy, leafy....hop complexity. As with any good New England style DIPA...the layers are multiple and complex. Earthy wheat, funky wet earth, dry wheat fields, tangy and sweet tropical juices with pineapple, black pepper, all spice, lemmon zest, make an appearance at some point. Crisp, pilsner and wheat style malt gives off a virtuous taste that adds color and excellent balance, allowing the hops to take the extended guitar solo, nut damn, if the malt doesn't do a fine job of laying down the rythm and beat.   A solid, hearty liquid fillef with dense hop layers, complex but light toned malt soeaks volumes of the style and the execution within the Vicinity.",0.7446366612674536,4.25,0.992
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"11.2oz bottle - no discernible date - poured into a flared pint at 44F.  Pours a fully cloudy honey golden, with three fingers of completely dense, fiamy white head, which holds its shape for several minutes.  Nose: Sweet, soft, creamy wheat grain, with an incredible classic yeast aroma - bringing an explosion of bubblegum, a hint of clove, unripe banana, and some fruity undertones atop a warm loaf of fresh bread. There's the faintest suggestion of orange rind and some mulling spice tucked in as well.  Palate: First sip brings that creamy grainy wheat flavour, with surprisingly little sweetness. The fruity yeast esters follow, with more bubblegum, faint clove, green banana, apple, faint clove, and some German hop florals. It's very clean, crisp, and tame. There's a subtle spicy kick before the finish, which brings more bubblegum, wheat grain, German hop notes, lots of clove, and a very toned -down bitterness compared to American hefewiezens.   Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is fairly light in body - crisp - with a noticeable softness to the feel. The soft wheat coats yhe tongue, and gives some nice texture. Effervescence is lively, but not aggressive or prickly. Everything feels appropriate for the style.  Overall: Hefeweizens are not a favourite style of mine. Nevertheless, I try to look at everything as objectively as I can. This is probably the most enjoyable hefeweizen I've had this far. It feela incredibly refined and complete, with no rough edges or off flavours. Unlike many American offerings, it isn't over-hopped or spiced in any way. It isn't a complex beer whatsoever. It isn't wildly unique or groundbreaking. It's a very classic style, after all. It is, on the other hand, a really great example of beer in its most simple, classic, original form. A true German offering. It may not br a glass to dive in and study, but it sure hits the spot when you want a cold beer, and this will certainly pair very nicely with many dishes.",0.7216411585218444,4.0,0.9917
Aaron,"Pours a dark brown color with a small beige head, collapsing to a small ring of lacing.  Smells of toffee, melting caramel, rose water, toasty oak and a hint of molasses. This is definitely on the sweeter side, with a rustic, wheat and malt backbone, adding a nice depth to the aromas. Develops a strong bourbon presence, which goes perfectly well with the other components of the nose.  Drinks fairly thick and silk, with almost no carbonation, revealing the beers heavy body in a perfect way.  Tastes of sweet toffee from the beginning with an additional caramel sweetness on top, balanaced only by the uprising oak. Develops a note of tobacco, once the barrel grows more prominent, with an almost smoky decadence. The focus maintains on the sweetness, defined by honey in this stage, while the dry bourbon acts as a well working counterpart.   This is sticky and overboarding with a well working balance. Once its sweetness is established, slowly the boozy oak barrel settles in to add a pleasant complexity, making this a nice, powerful sipper.",0.7167428248634488,4.0,0.9917
Sang Noir,"2015 Project No bottling date, but bought in late 2016  Appearance- Pours a deep dark mahogany color, ruby red highlights, fairly transparent when held to light. Finger thick, soapy, off-white colored head. Small amount of spotty head lacing on glass.  Aroma- Tart cherries, blackberries, grapeskins, mildly sour fruit notes. Soft oak, earthy and funky, vinous wine notes. Very mild bourbon notes and some hints of vanilla.   Taste- Juicy, tart cherries, berries, sour fruits. Rich malty and fruity sweetness balances tartness. Vinous, red wine notes, oaky, earthy. Soft, sweet bourbon, vanilla. Finishes w/ slight acidity and crisp tart fruitiness.  Feel- Medium bodied, crisp tartness but not overly sour, has a balancing sweetness throughout. Crisp, clean carbonation, palate cleansing.  Overall- Beer shows such a bold tartness and sweetness, yet excellently balanced and restrained. Wine and bourbon barrels come through with such a soft touch, neither overpowering eachother or the beer, but adding such depth and complexity. An excellently crafted beer.",0.7249971094870071,4.5,0.9917

Earthy, citrus.  4.5MF. One of best I’ve tasted in an IPA. Sticky, smooth. A pleasure to drink.  4.25 Taste. I was expecting tropical fruit. I didn’t taste any tropical fruit, but the grapefruit citrus rind is excellent.  Overall: excellent approach to an IPA. Wonderful hoppy Character.

Enjoy By IPA,"Enjoying the Enjoy By 07/04/2016! Actually...enjoy sounds like an understatement. This IPA is fabulous!! Pours a brilliant bronze and orange color. Nice thumbnail foam head. The lacing is ever present and semi sticky. An attractive drink for sure. The aroma covers the spectrum of fruity flavors with a constant undertone of biscuity malt. Mangoe, pineapple and all sorts of tropical goodness hit the nose. Midway, the citrusy tones( I'm thinking grapefruit pith) provide some zest. The resiny hop oils add some pungency. The tropical and citrusy fruit are most noticeable the first half of the drink. Also, the caramel malt backbone is present. Although there is lots of sweetness, the prevalence of hops truly takes over halfway. Citrusy hops, sharp pine needles, resin, herbal aftertaste. Overall, this is a big juicy and hoppy IPA, however, there is some dryness that keeps you wanting more. The body is medium, smooth, the carbonation is soft. So drinkable it's scary! Truly delicious! One of the best! World class!",0.7155329411246619,4.75,0.9911
Oude Geuze Vintage,"A - Golden, brassy orange color with an average sized, foamy, and bubbly white head with a bit below average retention and a thin bubbly lace left.  S - Well balanced hay/barnyard/funk along with some lemon citrus and apple. Has a good juicy aroma along with a touch of a tart and acidic aroma. Perfect balance between the aroma, my mouth is watering and it is very enticing.  T - Similar to the nose. Some funk and tartness with just a hint of sour taste. A lot of fruitiness with some apple and lemon being strongest. Hints of other golden and tropical fruit as well as some earthiness. Some hay and mustiness and a touch of lemongrass. Very well balanced sour.  M - Medium body with a healthy amount of carbonation. Fairly smooth with a drying finish and just the very slightest bit of puckering.  D - Well balanced and not overly sour/tart but has a nice balance.  Notes: Bottled 02/10/2005. A wonderful gueuze that is very well balanced with the tart/sour/funky flavor and a juicy fruitiness.

Beatification,"Huge thanks to nate8767 for shipping me my very first of a long time want.  Pours bright gold with a finger of white creamy head. Excellent lacing and retention.  Smells as much like a gueuze as any stateside sours I've had. Tart lemon and citrus with an underlying deep funk. Magnificent.  Flavors are similar. Lots of tart lemon and grass up front. Sourness really takes hold after that. Very light delicate flavors still stand out among the sour. Finishes musty and dry.  Creamy mouthfeel with good prickly carbonation.  I'm not sure it's the best sour I've ever had, but it's definitely a great one and something unlike most American Wild Ales. Perfect sourness level. The underlying components still shine through and create a great experience. Very excited to have a few more to age.",0.7098538567323837,4.5,0.9907
Chocolate Rain,"750ml bottle stored in my cellar for over a year. Poured into 18oz Funky Buddha snifter, bottle split three ways. Reviewed live.  A- Pours a dark black that has some translucency, actually slightly lighter then I was expecting. Pretty much no head, very still top, minimal carbonation, just some alcohol legs along the sides of the glass.  S- Rich chocolate, vanilla beans, lightly bourbon, extremely well balanced booze. Can tell it's got a high abv, but fits very nicely for how high it is and integrates well with the other aromas. Fairly aromatic.  T- This is where the beer gets really interesting: flavors of dark chocolate, cocoa nibs, bourbon, vanilla, hints of booze on this finish but nowhere near what you would expect at almost 20%, extremely well balanced. Aftertaste that lingers with chocolate and balanced vanilla.  M- Very smooth especially for 19.5%, a beer definitely should not be this smooth with an abv this high- feels more like 9%, fairly minimal carbonation but nice for the style. Can't believe how easy this is to drink.  O- This was a fantastic high abv stout that was incredibly easy to drink and extremely flavorful. I was expecting this to be overly boozey but the abv was well hidden and was surprisingly easy to drink with all the flavors coming out very nicely. I highly recommend seeking this out, just be careful with how dangerously smooth it is.",0.7242646532026021,4.5,0.9906
Sip Of Sunshine,"Really great beer. Enjoyed it more than Double Sunshine. Here goes:  A: Clear golden-orange color. Pours a massive head that leaves incredible lacing. Perfect.  S: Bouquet of flowers; very complex. Grassiness, grapefruit, orange, and citrus peel.  T: Follows the nose in terms of flavor profile. Incredible complexity. A little too dank to be rated perfectly, though; however, it's certainly not ovebearing. Provides smooth, easy drinking despite the relatively high abv.  F: Crisp, smooth, and perfectly drinkable. Amazing how light the mouthfeel is despite the beer being very high in alcohol content.  O: A great beer. Probably my favorite from the day at Lawson's.",0.7242105736852561,4.75,0.9905
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Got this one at the Bierkoning in A'dam.   From a 750 into a snifter VIntage 2010 Bottled 3 June 2013 300g per liter  APPEARANCE: Pours a small, off-white, light red head with decent retention. Clear poppy red in color with almost no carbonation evident. Head fades quickly and it looks almost flat in the glass rather quickly. Pretty color, though I wish the head made more of an impression.   SMELL: Lots of raspberries on the nose, with tart lemons, some funk, and just a hint of acidity. Slightly one dimensional, though the raspberries are quite lovely.   TASTE: Raspberries up front with tart lemon sourness and oak notes at the swallow. Bold and lingering finish of tart lemon, sweet-sour raspberries, some funky flavors and wood from the barrels. A hint of bitterness finds its way through too. Well balanced between the sour lambic and tart, sweet red fruits.   PALATE: Medium body and modest carbonation. Creamy and fuller on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes dry and puckering. A touch of acidity lingers. Good feel here.   OVERALL: This is really nice. Lots of good fruit flavor with a solid lambic as a base, and a full, creamy feel to support the show. Well balanced and very flavorful. The look was a little lack-luster, though we can forgive that for sure. Good stuff and well worth checking out. Recommended.",0.7142855115594459,4.0,0.9905
Juicy,"Bottle (2012)  Acquired via trade Thanks, mkabull!  This one does gush upon opening! Be warned!  Burnt apricot or peach flesh in color with a quickly forming, creamy off-white head of very small bubbles. Nice retention and this leaves messy lacing. Very pretty saison.  Definite citrus in the aroma, along with a concentrated, rotting fruit character (in a good way!), a mild to moderate funk character, and a bit of a champagne or white wine character that's tough to describe but definitely adds to the overall enjoyment and complexity of the aroma.  The flavor follows suit, though the flavor is more balanced than the aroma, as the (rotting, strong) citrus character is tamed down nicely by the complex, earthy funk, and champagne/white wine flavors. Some brick flavor as well, which adds nicely. This is delightful.  Medium bodied with high carbonation.  A lovely, enjoyable saison from Hill Farmstead. Shocking!",0.7344026598362928,4.5,0.9903

Enjoy By IPA,"4.20.16 had on 4.20.16 bottled on 3.14.16.   Wow, what a beer! I have not had the Enjoy by 4.20. It sells out fast around here. Now I can see why. The hops are perfectly displayed-pineapple, mango, orange, tangerine, grapefruit. I thought the pine and dank were in line with the rest of the hop's flavor components. The grapefruit and subtle resin kick up in the finish, lingering just a bit. The overall bitterness is moderate at best. It starts low and slow, peaking in the finish. But even the finishing bitterness is mellow enough that you don't think twice about going in for another sip. The hoppy bitterness is softened by pleasantly sweet, and light bready malts. There is some caramel in the malt as well. The malt is always present providing the perfect balance needed for a world class beer, which this beer is. I really enjoy the body of this brew too, smooth and slightly coating/creamy. Alcohol is well covered, which makes this a dangerous beer. All of this contributes to a well balanced, harmonious, super drinkable brew. If you have the opportunity, don't pass on it.

Double Orange Starfish,"Drank from a 1 pint (473ml) can purchased at Aslin Beer Company, Herndon, VA Served in a teku  Cloudy, yellow-orange appearance. The nearly opaque body was topped by frothy, finger-tall, bright white crown that fell to a lasting collar. A streaky latticework of lacing stuck all along the glass.  Fantastic hoppy and clean aroma. Big tropical fruit notes. Mango and guava came through strongest. Some honeydew melon was noticeable as well. Touch of dankness. Subtle citrus notes too. Nice juicy orange presence.  The flavor profile was nearly as impressive as the nose. Really hoppy and bold but fantastically well balanced. Terrific mix of citrus and tropical fruit notes. Loads of juicy orange flesh on the front end. Bit of mango and generic tropical fruitiness too. Crisp and lemony in the center. Orange peel came through on the back end and in the finish. Some white grapefruit as well. Hint of resiny bitterness.  Terrific creamy, frothy mouthfeel. Slick, smooth and supple on the palate. The liquid contained a fine, moderate, pillowy soft effervescence.  Double Orange Starfish is an excellent double IPA with a clean, potent hop profile and just enough malty sweetness to keep the bitterness in check.

Society & Solitude #4,"Hazy orange color with a nice bright white head. Aroma is fairly tropical with notes of mango and pineapple alongside a healthy dose of citrus zest. A light amount of malt notes in there as well.   Citrus notes dominate the palate with a nice array of grapefruit and orange. Bitterness is there to give a little kick but does not abuse your tastebuds like many DIPAs do. Finding this to be rather sweet with just enough malt backbone to help round things out.   Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice lively carbonation.

Schaerbeekse Kriek,"Poured from a 2011 750 mL bottle into a tulip.  There is a soft ’pop’ as the cork is released, and the pour into my glass has an energetic level of carbonation. The beer itself is a hazy dark pink rapsberry color throughout, with a few resplendent bubbles visibly rising from the bottom of glass. A gentle off-white head relaxes to a ring around the edge for most of the glass.  A robust cherry aroma is not overly strong but is definitely the most noticeable aroma. At first the cherries seem sweet and creamy, but there is a slightly sharp tartness that adds a little bit of an edge. Lemony lambic notes, tannic cherry skin, and some oaky red wine notes. As it warms the farmyard funk comes through, although it is not dominant by any means.  The Schaerbeekse cherries come through immediately. Once the fruit base is set, the tartness starts to build, bringing in notes of lemon and oak, and a bit of tannic vinous fruit. The lambic in the form of lactic acidity and the sweet cherries play off of each other for the majority of the sip. Just a bit of Bretty funk adds a background complexity. There is a mineral note in the finish.   As compared to some other fruit lambics, this has a somewhat richer body and creamier nature. The carbonation is smooth and gentle as opposed to crisp, which makes it feel undercarbonated at times. In reality, it is simply more of a subtle carbonation to go along with its subtle flavor. Even though it is tart and sour, I do not sense that it is overly acidic.  I enjoyed drinking this Kriek for sure. My fruit lambic preference goes to Cantillon, but this is a serious lambic.",0.7197043576705611,4.5,0.9889

Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Has a very barrel forward nose, defined by leather, wet basement, moldy wood and yogurt. The interesting thing about this is, that there is a recognizable freshness, coming from the base beer, at the same time. It provides aromas of lemon zest, soft wheat and dried herbs, building up a perfectly enjoyable collision.  Has a fine effervescence with a light, sour and dry body, making this remarkably refreshing, with a nice smoothness to it.  Tastes of an initial flavor explosion on the palate, mellowed by a pleasant yeast silkness, enriching unripe grapefruits, kiwi pulp, mushrooms and blue cheese amongst warming campfire wood. Turns a tad sweeter, with toffee joining in, highlighting the oranges by adding a fruity sweetness, entagled into the oak. This gets softened by an aqueous quality, producing just a light hint of spices, perfectly integrating lemon zest and a late herb dryness with some prevailing mushrooms.   Incredibly well nuanced beer with an absolutely astonishing complexity, while it drinks almost too easy with a world class mouthfeel. This may be the closest thing i‘ve yet enjoyed so far to a belgian saison / lambic from the US and puts up this brewery with the very best in the world for me.",0.7272902104140574,5.0,0.9885

Haze,"16 oz can. Funny story: As I finally walked in the doors after a 45 min wait in line and freezing temps the sweet sound of the Grateful Dead's Sugar Magnolia greeted me from the TreeHouse sound system. The bottom of the can reads: ""Going where the wind goes, bloomin' like a red rose""   A white haze to the yellow and golden liquid. Thick and healthy, totally unfiltered. Brawny white foam cap, thick, all-white clumps. Huge lacing left over.   The aroma has a very zesty citrus hop effect, mellon and mango, grainy earthiness, tropical fruit blend with a bitter to sweet effect, then a peppery kick at the end. Very aromatic.   The flavor is just bursting with complex hops, zesty earthy tones, sweet orange, peppery malt, clean fresh feel and overall vibe. A crispy bite wakes you up, full and lush mouthfeel follows from a totally unfiltered experience.   The feel and flavor finishes with a fun, earthy, zesty dry bite. Tropical juicy, zesty citrus, zippy golden wheat malt, melons, rustic earthiness sums up the taste pretty well. Levels of complexity are deep. It's an interesting ride for sure.

Swish,"From 16oz can into tulip. Pours a beautiful soft orange lemonade, with a minimal, but nice white head composed of larger than average bubbles. Nice ring remains around the circumference when the head dissipates.   The aroma of this beer is likely to invoke a smile. It’s a light tropical adventure headed by pineapple with floral hop fragrances. There is no malt in the odor, and it is very refreshing; lofty, pure, and without even a hint of aggression.   Feel is certainly juicy, though nicely integrated with the sharp micro-bubbles to give it some structure; it foams up a bit on the swallow.   The taste begins like a fruit juice, predominately pineapple with some citrus flavors. Resolves into a little mango and grapefruit, and then finishes slightly more on the citrus side—grapefruit and lemon is what I get—with a very light bit of lingering malty something. Grapefruit lingers as well. This is a primo NE double and certainly top notch. Juicy, drinkable, and impressive.",0.7119284327055221,5.0,0.9873
Peche 'n Brett,"Drank from a 1 pint, 9.4 fl. oz./750 ml wax dipped bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA Bottle No. 20430 Best by: 10/2020 Served in a tulip  Beautiful appearance. The hazy, golden-amber liquid was capped by a billowing, four-finger tall, bright white, fluffy mass. Large clumps of Brussels-style lacing cascaded down the glass. The head slowly dropped to a thick, frothy film.  The aroma was somewhat underwhelming. A super crisp, dry, powdery yeasty quality was balanced by subtle peach notes. Bright and lively. Slightly floral. A bit jasmine tea-like. The nose was also moderately tart and brett-y. Slightly funky. As the beer sat, the peach subsided and the yeastiness intensified. Dry, tannic, oaky notes also came through big time. Later, the peach reappeared.  The flavor profile was super dry and tannic. Fairly bitter as well. There was a subtle fruity quality on the front end and a touch of malty sweetness, but this was quickly washed away by tart, brett-y notes and a crisp, dry, powdery yeastiness. The beer was also really oaky and tannic. Lemon rind appeared on the back end and carried into the finish. Moderately bitter with a hint of earthy, aged hops. The oaky barrel notes again came through strong. Super tannic and dry. Almost a bit astringent. As the beer sat, subtle fruity notes appeared. Though the flavor profile was rather unrefined, the alcohol was barely noticeable.  The mouthfeel was medium bodied. Soft and creamy. This almost seemed a bit undercarbonated. The liquid contained a fine, frothy effervescence that tuned smooth and supple on the palate.  I really enjoyed Logsdon's Seizoen Bretta and Oak Aged Bretta but found this beer to be overly dry, tannic and one-dimensional. Even though I opened this bottle only a few months after cellaring it, the peach was hardly noticeable. Looking at many of the reviews here on BA, my only guess would be that this was stored for a while before being distributed. That said, I would love to revisit a fresher bottle someday.",0.7102749985556659,3.75,0.9868
Society & Solitude #4,"Poured into a flared tulip, the appearance was a cloudy/hazy burnt orange color with a finger’s worth of white foamy head that dissipates at a nice pace. Moderate lace speckles the glass nicely. The aroma starts off with a beautiful balance between the mango sweetness, somewhat tropical and then flowing into a nice rind-like citrusy bitter grip. Sweet onion starting to come out. The flavor yields to the bitter side first but very quick, and then dries up with the rind, full and pith-like with a super nice juicy to bitter balance rolling into a semi-sticky aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a great balance of sipping to sessionable sort of bittersweet feel to it. Good level of carbonation. Overall, extremely nice DIPA that I would love to have again.",0.7196051291856559,4.5,0.9866
Flora,"Batch 7  beautiful looking beer, hazed golden straw color, bright white head is dense but fizzes away quickly. aromas are just beautifully enticing and the flavors complimentary. there is a beautifully bright wine charter, lemon zest, mellow funky must quality, lactic, grassy, funky hay character, oak vanilla. just absolutely beautiful, a strong tartness to it. mouthfeel is zippy and crisp. 5++",0.7353780914902663,5.0,0.9864
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"11.2oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours a cloudy glowing burnt yellow with a fluffy creamy eggshell white head that sticks around leaving great thick retention and very sticky lacing. The aromas have lots of banana and cloves. Hints of bubblegum. The yeast does its thing. The flavors follow the nose perfectly. The flavors are extremely clean. More banana and cloves with some other subtle spice notes in the mix. More bubblegum. Subtle hints of citrus. The yeast blends well with everything. Solid malt backbone. Alcohol goes completely unnoticed. Mouthfeel is great. It's light with moderate carbonation. Very creamy and fluffy. Too smooth and easy to drink.   This beer is a classic. It's extremely refreshing and perfect for the warm weather, or anytime for that matter. The craftsmanship is very impressive. Highly recommended.",0.7201488357608891,4.5,0.986
Second Fiddle,"Canned on 3/6/19  Pours a clear, faintly copperish kind of gold with an ample, slightly rocky white head; very nice retention that results in plenty of persistent lacing and a frothy, albeit bubbly collar.  Aromas of dank peach, grapefruit, and tropical pith comes through strongly, with lighter notes of orange zest, pine, and bits of hoppy spice following; a restrained dankness comes through in spots, while a clear crisp malt backbone that dives into deeper notes of fresh rising dough and black bread crusts starts to shine on the finish.  Taste profile is predominantly dank herbs and fruity rind, along with subtle hints of white grape must in the background; great bit of restrained hoppy, pithy bitterness along with some crackery malt on the finish; bitter, juicy, and hints of sweetness, this is a soft but incredibly varied IPA profile.  Mouthfeel brings a medium-light body with perfectly balanced carbonation; crisp throughout with an underlying fluff to give it the most easygoing kind of weight across the palate; this just pops on the tongue, and peaks across the palate almost perfectly.  A true hybrid of West Coast and New England style IPAs; with so many IPAs out there now, this one may have lost some of its previous luster, but damnit if it isn't still one of the more universally palate-pleasing examples of an IPA out there. Soft but balanced, and showing great variety in its profile and consistency throughout, this is still quietly a great IPA that shouldn't be overlooked.",0.7513475775906635,4.0,0.986
Society & Solitude #4,"Beer pours that of any HF IPA I've tasted. It's a light, hazy straw color with a fluffy white head. It has the same mysterious HF glow.   Best smelling ipa. Ever. This smells so good. Juicy fruits, straight up. Papaya, mango and pineapple. A complex, well-crafted juice, if you will. Well, not quite...  Tastes a lot like the smell. This is a super complex, fruity, tangy ipa. All the same fruit flavors that come in waves after each sip. There is some bitterness in the flavor, but it serves only to balance, not to overwhelm. I don't mind an overwhelming bitterness, but that isn't what this beer is about. I don't know how it's possible to achieve such a unique and distinct flavor profile in an ipa, but I'm sure it's some brilliant combination of the galaxy, citra, and well water.   Mouthfeel is again typical of HF IPAs; and by typical I mean perfect. Creamy, rich, medium-full bodied. Insanely drinkable.   This is my second favorite ipa only next to Ephraim. The flavor profile between is is very different, but all the stand out features remain consistent between each brew. Shaun knows which elements to highlight and which elements to leave alone. Can't wait to try more and more.",0.7227811897363456,4.75,0.9856
Aaron,Had on tap at HFB after bottle run. Absolutely extraordinarily perfect high octane version of a English Barleywine. Had a beautiful if brief light tan head; excellent residual lacing. Rich tawny orange- ruby accented color. Like a beautiful piece teak. Both simple and then complex to light. Nose was rich with toffee/caramel; wood; vanilla; soft herbal flower and bitterness. Taste magnified all these and slowly revealed tannins; slight hints of licorice; apple; and allspice as it warmed. Sweetness but never candy or cloying. Traces of whiskey helped round out flavors but well in background. Feel was luxuriantly soft and smooth; very mildly dense like young port but never thick or distracting.  Oh and $4 for 4oz glass????  Absurdly good beer and very accessible cost. Barreled EBW is one of my favorite styles ... and Aaron is without question the best I’ve ever had. Masterpiece.,0.7099808444861959,5.0,0.9853
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"B2 April 4, 2017  pours out a mostly clear brilliant golden straw color, creamy bright white head with suds atop and great retention. aromas of lemon, hay, fresh cut grass, floral, oak, mellow earthy funk, spice and bright citrus peel in there. on palate there is the above mentioned notes with even more depth and coherence. quite a pungent hit of fruity citrus and fuzzy peach flavor dancing in there, almost invoking characteristics of a NEIPA. but there is this beautiful funky dryness and oak character to balance it out. hay, fresh cut grass, lemon peel, musty grape skin, white grape, mellow acidity, oaky sweetness hinting at vanilla. the feel is so effervescent and crisp, wonderfully complimenting the flavor profile.",0.7151728599898088,5.0,0.9848
Haze,"thanks so much to tenderbranson69 for sharing this -from the can in a tulip chilled.  I had taken a long walk and this slaked my thirst in just the right way.  The color is like fresh pressed juice with white head and fine bead with lots of lace clinging in rings with good retention. The smell is so juicy-you might believe there is actual fruit in this - very tropical! the smell has a citrus quality with lemony and lightly grassy zesty smell that brings out herbal and subtle stone fruit accents. The feel is great - fruity and tangy with medium carbonation and semi-sweet entry yet juicy tangy and bitter balances out with a semi-dry yet very light astringent aspect with a long hop finish.  The taste is as great as the smell hints at just a lovely mix of sweet citrus and tropical fruit flavors in the hops with a very mild malt to supplement that juicy taste and soft bitter accent with a more herbal/sweetgrass taste in the back with malt and bitterness more balanced in order that there is no alcohol in the taste. Overall I found this to be smooth, drinkable fresh and lively as far as the intensity of the hop flavor and it is very quaffable for a 8.2% beer I was able to sip and enjoy this very easily looking forward to future tastes of this fine brew.",0.7165033531372373,4.5,0.9847
Green,"Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass (1 month old). Appearance is hazy yellow/brown with some orange around the middle, two finger thick head with pretty good retention. Smell is floral and earthy hops, with notes of tangerine, resin, grass, wheat, pineapple and hay.  Taste follows the nose except with a surge of earthy tangerine juice coming through. There is moderate resiny sweetness that melds everything together and fairly low bitterness. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy with good body upfront and a great bite on the finish, flavors linger on and on.   Overall, this is one of the top two IPAs I have had, the other being Haze. The juicy and earthy hop flavors are unreal (good representation of Galaxy), yet the drinkability and balance are great. The bitterness is perfectly placed, and there is just enough sweetness. Green is a great complement to Haze and Julius in which the flavors are more different than I expected, about perfect all the way around.",0.7170772589556421,5.0,0.9847
Sip Of Sunshine,"Big thanks to my buddy Robo for this one.  There's a soft hop derived haze to its golden amber body. Two fingers of paper white head shows off some serious stick.   It's like a peach and mango creamsicle in a glass. Ripe and sweet tropical fruits are bold but also very soft and rounded. There's a fluffy vanilla edge to it as well. Its creamy texture actually comes through on the nose. It's not all gooshy and round, however. Juicy fruit and pineapple give it a lively tang.   Mango and papaya come in layers of fleshy, ripe, tropical goodness. The middle is plus sized and peachy. Juicy fruit maintains its tang and transitions well into a fresh, resin forward, piney backing. An outline of biscuit is all that comes from its malt bill. Its perceived bitterness is exceptionally balanced and rounded.  The texture is nothing short of lovely. Creamy and clean. Dry on its edges with a perfectly rendered level of bitterness. The 8% ABV hides in the shadows of the melange of ripe tropical fruit.  Thank god for the Vermont style IPA. Bold, bright, in your face fresh with tropical fruit and a bitterness that cleans and balances instead of defines and lingers. I can't ask for anything more.",0.7181272635404451,4.5,0.9838
Enjoy By IPA,"12 oz bottle that was bottled on 9/24/17 and opened on 11/2/17 poured into a Duvel chalice.  Only a very slight haze happens upon an otherwise bright gold and amber color. A white, rocky topped foam has given decent coverage.   The aromatic density for this IPA is pretty stunning. Deep layers of several different hop effects pop out of the glass, earthy grapefruit, citrus blend, sweet and earthy.... The malt seems pretty hefty with some big honey and caramel aroma's . A hot/dry forest floor aroma is prevalent, dried leaves and maybe some golden wheat as well. There's a lot going on here.  The hop complexity becomes very clear with the first sip, whamo!! A hearty, crisp and earthy hop bite is impressive. Certainly a fresh, crisp and snappy overall feel and body. The sweet malty aroma really becomes much more crisp, light and bright in the flavor. A slightly bitter, metallic herbs and holden grains seem to seemlessly flow around eachother. Big earthy complexity, grainy, dry, citric and leafy come to mind from this combo of hops. The bitterness never gets too much, its in check but still delivers a bite. The 9.4 % abv. Is very well hidden and only adds to the depth and provides a nice warming effect. Earthy and dry citrus is the short version of this hop flavor, which is monsterously complex.  Stone still knows how to deliver the goods. Freeeesh.  Enjoy By 4/20/19!! * Update 12 oz. Can Just a bit late!...4/26/19  Copper gold, only a slight haze. Sticky white foam.  The 10 (10!!) Different hops give off a very stoney aroma. Dense and sweet citrus based tropical hoppy aromatics are deeeep. A caramel and honey tinged amber malt makes for that classic West Coast style balance.  Crisp bite, turns to a slick medium bodied feel, a bit boozy at 9.4 % abv which gets ramped up from the dry hitter side of the hops. With complexity comes a compromise in drinkablity sometimes, especially for the heady Western IPA's.",0.7386120174265259,4.25,0.9833
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Pours with a large but very quickly dissipating head. Not much lacing. Straw-colored and cloudy.  Aromas of esters very forward and prominent--banana and citrus as expected, and very pleasing. Bubblegum sweetness in the background. Very little if any phenolic spice. Very little yeast. Rather subdued overall, but still a fine aroma.  Tastes much like the aroma in the same order of prominence, with the esters perhaps overpowering the other aspects. Banana and gingerbread flavors immediately come to mind, with a touch of pepper in the aftertaste. Not sickly sweet, but perhaps a bit sweeter than expected.  The mouthfeel is remarkably full-bodied, and even slick, but with a nice crisp finish, doubtless from strong carbonation.  Overall a fine brew that I will likely try again for a re-rate, just in case I got an ""old"" bottle. I like wheat beers, including others by this brewer, but was somewhat disappointed in what others have found to be the ""paragon"" of the style. This one checks all of the boxes for a Hefe, but seemed out of balance, with too much emphasis on the sweetness, and not enough yeast and spice.",0.7145536220319062,4.0,0.9833
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"On-draught @ One Mile House in Manhattan. 13% ABV (2016 vintage).  Aroma promises a chewy malty stout with leathery bourbon notes, tobacco, caramel, and dark malts. Excellent barrel character. Ideal level of sweetness. Base beer could offer more, but it doesn't get eclipsed. Aromatic intensity is moderate.  Leathery chewy thick texture, with a smooth wet mouthfeel. Plenty of body here, but no overcarbonation.  Bourbon barrel notes slip seamlessly into the malty base beer, evoking leather and tobacco but no overt vanilla/vanillin, coconut, or toasty oak. Malty core offers chocolate malts, caramel, and dark malts. Well balanced and built, even if the dazzling intricacy and nuanced subtlety of the best expressions of the style isn't quite paralleled. Well built fare.  Overall, it's drinkable fare particularly for an imperial stout (let alone a 13% ABV one) and will please fans of regular expedition. The bourbon could be improved as could the beer as a whole, but it's nice stuff as-is. Worth the $1/1oz pricetag, but I wouldn't go out of my way to nab a bottle - astonishingly well-disguised though its high ABV may be.  High B- (3.46) / WORTHY",0.7210103713180233,3.5,0.9832
Sip Of Sunshine,"Got the word from a friend that the Brattleboro, VT Co-op had this. Sure enough! Opened/sampled and reviewed on 3/23 Canned date on bottom: 3/7/17  Only a very gentle haze and lazy stream of bubbles can be seen through this nearly opaque, burnt golden color with orange highlights liquid. A classic 2"" high, clumpy, sea foam looking cap stands proud. Long lasting retention and constant thin coverage with Obvious sticky lace left after the fall.   A blend of caramel sweet and golden pilsner like malt and tropical fruity notes hits the nose first. An earthy, herbal....gritty scent is obvious, grapefruit, tangy citrus and mellon follow. Besides the big, fruity complexity it is actually very floral, surrounded by a peppery earth aroma. Very nice nose indeed. This has a big, impressive New England style aroma.   The first slow sip delivers a bit of a surprising spice and pepper bite, much more earthy than I had expected. It was the first thing I smelled, and the herbal, earthy hop bite shines through in the flavor as well. A very crispy, gritty-grains malt taste, very ""Farmhouse"" esque with bits of golden wheat and tangy, sour malty effects. The hop complexity is very high, delivering a sharp, earthy-bitter bite that quickly mellows to a blend of tropical>citrus>mellon fruity flavor's that all blend together to make a very unique overall flavor spectrum. Certainly multi layered hop flow of flavor.   Double IPA strength at 8 %abv. Is WAY to easy to sip. No problem sipping fast! Rather grainy and full feelung at first with more of a big juicy feel later on. A tangy, earthy citrus flavor lingers for a bit in the aftertaste.   The high alpha hops are obvious, they pack an excellent, earthy-bitter punch but is also rounded out by an excellent malt balance that grounds the overall flavor very well. This DIPA draws obvious comparisons to some of the very best, big hop brews I've had recently : Heady Topper, The Green and Space Juice. Sick complexity that is easy to drink, is a new level for the DIPA.",0.7372071702583022,4.75,0.9831
Todd The Axe Man,"Canned on 8/19/19. 16oz can poured into a tulip. Pours a hazy golden, but it's not cloudy or murky; small white head that fades leaving decent retention and lacing. The aromas are floral along with some citrus notes. Mild hints of coconut in the mix. Some fresh grass. Some bread and crackers. Malts are there. The flavors basically follow the nose. Some grapefruit and orange coming through. More subtle hints of coconut. More fresh grass. More bread and crackers. Solid bitterness. Mild spiciness. Some black pepper coming through in the finish. Malts do their thing without dominating. Finishes juicy and dry at the same time, but it's probably on the juicier side. Alcohol goes unnoticed for the most part. Mouthfeel is nice. It's on the fuller side of medium-bodied with active carbonation. It's sharp, crisp, slightly fluffy, smooth and easy to drink.   This is a solid IPA. It's nice, but it's really nothing ""special"" based on the acclaim, in my opinion. It's not bad at all, but I guess I was just personally expecting something crazier. The craftsmanship is on point. Not bad at all.",0.7100839127609089,3.5,0.9829
Juicy,"Batch 2  A: Pours an amber copper in color, small fizzy head, darker than I expected. S: Super complex, big fruity peach and mango, oakiness, funk notes, more citrus, beautiful aroma on this thing. T: Extremely well balanced - oak and barrel, punchy tropical fruit and citrus, light white wine, slightly acidic.  M: Crisp and clean, super drinkable. O: Wanted this to be as good as I hoped and it certainly was. Would love to drink this more often, just a joy to drink.",0.7193450161249255,4.75,0.9826
Dragonsaddle,"Dragonsaddle is only moderately hazed, giving a unique look in the 3 HH cans sampled today, a bit darker than its counterparts with a hue that goes just beyond amber. The head is a tall, frothy one with great hold and stick. Not only does the pillow stand for a good while, but lacing coats the glass very nicely as the beer drops as well. This one's all about the tropical fruits, but it incorporates citrus, dankness, pine and earth in a way that makes the balance and complexity even more impressive than Hoof Hearted's similar offerings. Spiciness, sweetness and bitterness all come together in a unique and effective way to make this one of the more exceptional IIPAs on the market. Not only that, but the malt balance does just enough to make this beer drinkable in a way it couldn't be without. The body is full and weighty without being too heavy on the palate. It's got a nice melding of crispness and smoothness, going into a finish that's dry but not harsh. Alcohol warms and builds up with each sip, so it's one to be careful with.",0.7412532899994744,4.5,0.9825
Darkstar November,"With the spice of rye and the savory sweetness of molasses, the mad scientists at Bottle Logic come up with a nonlogical ale that doesn't make any sense outside of wowing the palate with utter indulgence.  Pitch black and quickly thwarting any meaningful foam, the stout quickly looks like tar sitting in the glass, but with slight tawny bronze edged and legging. Decadence ensues with the very first scent of dark chocolate, whisky, espresso and molasses. Just as the booze tingles the nose with a tangy peppery sensation, its lavishly malted taste glides onto the middle palate with a dense cakey taste and texture.  Along the middle palate, the beer's reckless malt sweetness latches tightly onto each and every tastebud and endures the session easily. Meanwhile the complex flavors of bittersweet chocolate, black walnut, rich espresso and slightly burnt brownies give the session a pastry-like taste and texture. Molasses brings a kiss of butterscotch along with savory, complex and robust charm that melds seamlessly with the oaken character of whisky, coconut, caramel and vanilla late on the palate.  Ridiculously full and creamy on the tongue, the beer doesn't need any meaningful carbonation for its silky smooth, velvety and marshmallowy texture. Simmering warmth gives the beer a spicy offset to the density of malt while the grit of rye whisky keeps complex tastes coming late. A long linger of molasses brings the beer to the edge of sherry and port while retaining an imperial stout identity.",0.7098283915689645,4.5,0.9821
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"This is one of the prettiest beers to look at. Big foamy head and beautiful yellow-orange gold color, lots of carbonation. Smells very spicy and fruity, slightly fermented fruit, very sweet. Tastes crisp and also very spicy, cloves, and with some subtle fruitiness that isn't as strong as I think some people make it sound. This is a good thing, as I prefer the wheaty, honey drizzled bready flavors over sweet fruit. Feels super crisp and light, very refreshing and drinkable. Perfect for a warm, sunny day. Overall this is a veritable classic, and certainly deserves its acclaim.",0.7196542132580704,4.25,0.9819
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Slightly hazy red colour with a small but very short lasted white head.   Intensely fruity aroma. Massive raspberry and raspberry seed aroma coming out of this 7 year old vintage. Funky too. Complex with fruity, tart and earthy notes. Big.  Massive tart funkiness but not powerfully acidic. Just rounded acidity that plays off the raspberry flavour and aroma. Interesting lemon note. Low barnyard flavours but the fruitiness really makes this a winner.  Medium-light body with moderately-high carbonation. Super.  An excellent beer in the finest Cantillon style. The Lou Pepe range truly is the pinnacle of what they produce. The even rarer stuff is hardly worth the effort compared to this sublime product.",0.7379801238192059,4.75,0.9812
Society & Solitude #4,"Pours a nice, frothy snow-white head. Retention is good, and very nice long lines of lacing persist. Brew is a pulpy, almost completely opaque light orange color.  Peppery hop notes first greet my nose (similar to NZ hop varietals), carrying tropical and light citrus notes as well. There is a sweet but understated malt presence; very much there, but not allowing itself to upstage the hops.  Flavor indeed follows the nose: very soft and subtle tropical fruits, peppery spice, and a long, muted citrus peel finish. Just a tiny hint of dankness at the end. Malt balance throughout is soft, creamy, and superb; very light biscuit and bread. Brew is intensely bitter, but incredibly approachable despite.  Long, long finish; very lively, with no sting; minimal foaming; juicy. I think medium is right about on for feel, with a huge, juicy, sticky lingering finish. The bitterness really cleanses your mouth on the finish, leaving you begging the next sip. Absolutely no hint of alcohol.  This reminds me of all the rare, sought-after new-hop-varietal big DIPAs made on the West coast, but with the soft, creamy mouthfeel that, to me, makes HF special. Fruity and peppery hops are showcased, somehow both bold and upfront, yet subtle and balanced with the malts.  Yet another superb beer. My favorite S&S? I'm thinking no, but absolutely delicious, nonetheless.",0.7246188094684635,4.5,0.9811
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"A fruit beer executed to near perfection. With the taste of raspberry locked intact, the supporting ale celebrates the berry's bright flavor, its zesty acidity, and its crisp and refreshing taste in ideal fashion; and does so without backing down either.  Delightfully mauve-pink in color, the lightly carbonated ale carries a vibrant tawny appearance and simply glistens in the glass. The bright acidity of raspberry, rose wine, cork and burlap offers the nose a racy fruit scent that's contrasted by equal parts earth and rusticity.  As the beer hits the tongue, the palate is taken back by the beer's acute acidity that plays out above the modest lingering sweetness of fructose and wafer-thin malt. Slim on hops, the slight malt starch supports the beer's impressive sourness and its delicate brine without much interference in taste. Without being overly vinegar, or of lime, or of barnyard funk or game, the sourness is potent but elegant and refined.  Its light body is both softened with carbonation but is also given a sprite effervescent that springs from the tongue like brut champagne. Acidity strips the thirst from the palate and ushers in a high rate of refreshment and drinkability that outweighs its intense raspberry sourness. With an afterglow of fruit, wheat, cork and white pepper.",0.7179700700209923,4.5,0.981
Blanc De Blancs,"A- Pours a bright, medium straw golden in color. A small, one finger head forms and dissipates quickly down to a trace of bubbles around the edges of the glass. The body of the beer is nearly entirely clear. The lacing is minimal with the lack of a prominent head.  S- Starts off with a mild to somewhat assertive white grape fruitiness on the nose. Just a touch of crisp tartness is present in the scent, but the chardonels really shine through here. The scent displays a little bit of grapey sweetness, but not a whole lot. My overall impression of the smell is that of a slightly tart, off-dry chardonel, that has just a touch of funky dryness at the very end.  T- Starts off by assaulting the tongue with fairly aggressive punch of juicy sour flavor. The grape fruit flavors take a back seat to the overall sour flavor, although the tartness is derived out of the fruit. In the middle of the drink, the sourness becomes somewhat acidic and very reminiscent of a War Heads candy. After the peak of the sour flavor, a touch of funkiness creeps in and gives more of a grainy flavor underneath the tartness. Dryness from the barrel is detectable at the end of the drink, although the prominent flavor is still juicy and somewhat fruity tartness.  M- This beer is very true to the style and feels pretty much like a champagne. The only difference between a champagne and this beer is the perceived level of thickness because this beer feels fairly thick on the tongue. This is more of a sipper due to the harsh sour flavors in the taste profile.  Overall, this was way different than I expected. I was expecting more of a wine-like drinking experience given the name, ingredients, and style. With that being said, this is still a tremendous beer. If you are a sour fan, this offers a great, juicy sourness in addition to some great complexity from the yeast and barrel aging.",0.7135383098759371,4.5,0.9808
Oude Geuze Vintage,"The culmination of my visit to Moeder Lambic in Brussels was a 750ml bottle of this gorgeous gueuze. Costing a whopping, but understandable €35, this 9-year old vintage was served with appropriate pomp and ceremony in a classic Belgian Gueuze basket. Lot number on the bottle said 13/04/2002.  Pours a deep golden colour, orange hued in places, with a frothy head of escaping bubbles. Lace sticks statically around the glass, but is otherwise rather still. The extra depth and darkness to the colour I put down to age. It looks good.  Nose is, oh god, just phenomenal. So classic, but melded and blended. That classic rubbery gueuze funk, along with tart fruit, apple skin, latex, vanilla, oak, and even a sweeter berry-like aroma. Aged characters like wine cork come through as well. There's so much too this, and it's immensely complex, but it's all so well integrated. You just don't get a better gueuze nose.  Taste is similar. All classic flavours of course, but all with a common purpose. Sharp fruit, grapeskin, wood, sawdust, oak, tannins. All these characters and more stay and dance on the palate leaving it complex, but long. It doesn't use the full breadth of the palate, but it must explore just about every element of the ""gueuze"" palate.  And age? What age? Apart from the integration and the mellowness of the characters' combination, this is as clean and crisp as ever. I can see this easily lasting another 10 years.  (But it's great now, too...)",0.7131872089896794,4.5,0.9804
Sip Of Sunshine,"A near perfectly clear yellow golden to light amber hue completely blanketed by a foamy white head. Excellent retention and lacing.  Smell is a smorgasbord of intoxicating aromas. Everything from lemon, orange, and grapefruit to gooseberry, mango, and sweet onion.  Flavors of tangerine, lemon, and lime are complimented wonderfully by sappy pine.  A smooth crisp start leans into a bit of a velvety /prickly sensation, ending with a sharp and lasting bitterness. The 8% promise is masked very well in this sticky, well carbonated concoction.  Overall, this is my jam. It's complexities are familiar, it's bitterness is unforgiving. In a world of confusing IPA's, this one stands out true. A modern day classic so to speak. Cheers, and thank you very much Dave!",0.7223575014613653,4.75,0.9797
Haze,"Pours a bright yellow, clouded color with a one finger broad white head.  Smells of a tropical mix of grapefruit, passion fruit and fresh squeezed lime pulp. Offers a tropical sweetness on the nose, without a hint of malts but a plethora of well diversed hops instead.  Has a medium, smooth and soft mouthfeel with a long lasting fruitiness and just a dry note during the aftertaste of the beer.  Tastes of lime pulp, dried oranges and papaya, with a crackery maltiness underneath. Has a light effervescence onwards from its mid palate, together with riper turning fruits. Finishes calm, well nuanced on the still fruity hops, which add a little bit of sweetness, creating a papaya, passion fruit impression.  Very hop forward in a tropical ne ipa way, well nuanced with an astonishing depth, resulting seemingly solely from the hops themselves.",0.7140927496950887,4.25,0.9795
Green,"UPDATED REVIEW: Canned 7/12, consumed 7/17.  A: More than any other beer I’ve ever had, this beer pours like freshly squeezed orange juice. Incredibly turbid and vibrant in the glass. Puffy head of tiny bubbles sticks around for a while, leaving a thick lacing up the glass.  S: Straight up perfectly ripe, sugary sweet citrus fruit. Orange, tangerine, pineapple, peach. Subtle notes of freshly cut herbs. Doughy, sugary white bread. Ripe banana. Bubble gum. Insanely tropical and appetizing.   T: Tropical fruit explosion. Right off the bat, Green hits you with some powerful hop flavors. The Tree House tasting notes are spot on—I definitely get the orange sorbet and pineapple. Some peach and yellow grapefruit as well. It’s initially extremely juicy without much sweetness, which allows you to really hone in on the explosion of flavor. The tropical burst transitions into the typical Tree House sweet bready yeast. Finishes with perfect level of bitterness over herbaceous notes of pine.  M: Unbelievably creamy and drinkable for a 7.5% beer. Tropical fruity flavors coat the mouth before being overtaken by a medium bitterness that accompanies the rich, piney, herbaceous aftertaste.   O: This is my second time having Green, and I can definitively say that it is my favorite IPA (from a list that includes Julius…). The initial tropical burst is perfectly complemented by the soft, doughy mouthfeel that follows. The transition to a substantially bitter, resinous, almost vegetal herby finish is one of the most unique and enjoyable aspects of this beer. I could drink this everyday. Totally deserving of my first 5/5.",0.7098937081640722,5.0,0.9789
Scaled Up,"750ml bottle served in a tulip. Pours a dub orange with a slight haze to the clarity and a half-inch, frothy, bright white head. Great nose - bright citrus fruit notes, rind and a hint of spice. Taste consistent with nose - tangerines, rind and a kiss of an earthy/herbal quality to add some complexity. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with a pleasant, even carbonation and a kiss of acidity. Overall, another solid DIPA from Trillium. Not my favorite simply because they have so many outstanding offering; however, really fresh and quaffable.",0.7162907864465261,4.0,0.9788
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2009 Vintage. Poured into footed pilsener glass. Paired with Tikka Massala. Reviewed under medium low artificial light. Taken from notes.  Appearance: Pours a hazy ruby brew with Ambar highlights. Forms a fizzy pink head that holds well. Low perceived carbonation.  Aroma: Medium high intensity on the nose. Intense sourness, raspberry and alot of funk: barnyard, leather.  Taste: High intensity on the mouth. Raspberry, citric flavour, some dark fruit manifestation, leather, horse blanket. Just wonderfully bold, intense and complex.  Mouthfeel: Very tart and acidic. Medium body. Relatively low carbonation. Very dry. Love the challenging yet elegant and balanced palate.  Overall: This is just a fantastic classic lambic, a model to others of the style, a world beater in its category. The only reason it didn't get straight 5's throughout is the due to the ponderance given to personal taste.  Additional notes: Paired great with the Indian food, as the acidity cut through the creamy richness of the food and as the fruit and rustic character dealt great with the spicy, floral character of the food.",0.7427634272321703,4.5,0.9784
Sang Noir,"2012 project. Slight gusher into oversized tulips. Real dark with light brown thick ring. Amazing nose with layers of complexity. Bright tart cherry, berries, red grape, oak, and strong sherry notes. Strong acidity up front with tart cherry and sweet figs then strong maltiness with dark caramel malts shining. Finishes with a drying tannic note. Medium bodied and medium high carb. Sharp acidity and tannins are the only drawback in the mouthful. Really nice to split a bottle of this and really enjoy the nuances.",0.7164300499063551,4.5,0.9781
Enjoy By IPA,"Enjoy by 4.20.18 from 12 oz can. Beautiful pour - brilliant clear copper with great head and steady bubbling. Smell from my tulip glass is ripe fruit, dank grass, the waft of alcohol and a touch of citrus. Taste is an intense depth of balanced malt, hop bitterness, carbonation and hop flavor. Finishes slightly sweet on the back end. They have done a nice job taking what could have been an overly intense beer and making it very drinkable. This is a great beer.",0.7147174894924344,4.25,0.9779
Beatification,"Batch 005. Ginormous thanks to MrKennedy for sharing. Reviewed from notes.  Hazed light orange with a modest white head that falls smartly to a film.  Simply glorious blend of tangy, bright, sherbety and earthy characteristics, manifesting as lemon warheads, oaked white grapes and miscellaneous sour citrus.  Follows the nose, swamping the sense with a rich vein of bright acidity. Brings back childhood memories of Vitamin C tablets, coupled with strong notes of green capsicum. Properly sour.  Medium bodied, with mild but also spritely carbonation leading to a vibrant, puckering, zesty dry finish.  Amazing. ""Tangy"" has never seemed a more apt adjective. Had high expectations and was not at all disappointed. The sort of beer that renders conventional aroma and flavour nouns largely obsolete as meaningful descriptors of character.",0.7391213537595643,5.0,0.9779
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"A 2002 vintage shared generously yesterday by Richard.  A: The pour is almost red rose in color with almost no head despite a fairly vigorous pour.  S: The raspberries have certainly begun to fade, but they are still very noticeable. The fruit provides a slight sweetness to the nose which nicely offsets the very acidic and tart aromas.  T: This beer is extremely acidic and doesn't have quite the fruitiness left to balance this out (but this is what you expect from Cantillon). The oak is not all that present, but there is certainly a dryness from both the wood and the fruit.  M: Due to the lack of carbonation, the beer is quite slick and smooth on the palate. The high acidity and overall tannic quality of the beer gives a very dry finish.  D: I would like to try this beer again, perhaps in a fresher state. This is certainly a very nice lambic, even with a fading fruit character.",0.7162983051937636,4.0,0.9777
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Look: Cloudy but clear (Does that make any sense? You can see through it, but like any hefe it's not ""crsytal clear"") ale the color of pale straw. Proper head of dense white bubbles that sit atop the ale for a peoper amount of time.   Smell: Pineapple, banana, wheat. Some notes of pepper and spice, but the fruity esters dominate in a lovely way.   Taste: Banana and bubble gum. What you'd expect of a hefe.  Feel: Very clean and smooth on the palate.  Overall: Easily one of the best of the style I've ever had. I would offer this up to anyone looking for a proper representation of the style.",0.7141046468337504,4.75,0.9776
Nelson,"Pours a very light, pale yellow color, with a thin layer of white head. Looks like cloudy apple or grapefruit juice. The smell is very fruity and bright, with citrus & slight mango aromas.  The taste is tart & well balanced with the slightly peppery rye flavor. The hoppiness is very nice, strong but not overpowering. There are notes of tropical fruits, but not much malt. The alcohol is well-masked.  The carbonation is moderate, with mild body. Smooth & well-balanced. This is a delicious IPA. Easy to drink, tart, fruity, bright and very tasty. I highly recommend it & will seek it out again.",0.7240649090698449,4.5,0.9775
Society & Solitude #4,"Poured from a 12oz can into a tulip glass. About three weeks old, the hop aroma is still incredible. Smell is a good mix of Citra and Galaxy hops with notes of orange pureé/tangerine (floral), pineapple, and some grass/earthy flavors. Taste follows the nose but is not quite as pleasant overall with some interesting bitterness. It is relatively dry with a touch of honeysuckle sweetness. There is great creamy body up front with a refreshing and smooth finish. Mouthfeel is medium-full in body with relatively low carbonation.  Overall, this is an excellent double IPA with great aroma. Although somewhat similar, the flavor is not quite as good/balanced as Abner, Double Galaxy, and Double Nelson but is right behind them. I enjoyed it more than Society & Solitude #3 when tasting at the brewery. With just about all Hill beers, it is high recommended.",0.7186735910439681,4.5,0.977
Society & Solitude #4,"I drank this at Matt's birthday tasting last night. Thanks for sharing this, Matt!  Mildly hazy orange yellow with a dense white head that falls off to a disk. The nose? JFC. Big fruit - citrus, stone fruit, bright, redolent and resplendently hoppy. Not grassy at all. Beautiful aromatic. The citrus is more orange and tangerine than grapefruit. Fantastic stuff.  The palate opens with a great balance between bitterness and fruitiness, with the brightness of Citra front and center, while the tropical notes from Galaxy play a secondary but crucial role. Delicate but firm, there's pineapple and mango coupled with a very enjoyable citrus note. Malt character is mild, a little doughy, even. That said, this is all hops. Drying, mildly fruity and a touch resiny on the finish, this has great balance between the fruity flavors and bitterness. Medium light in body, moderately carbonated, this is fantastic stuff.",0.7270068720437293,5.0,0.9767
Vicinity,"On-tap 4/1/2017 at the brewery in Canton, MA, served in a tulip glass.  A: The beer is a cloudy dark yellow color, with a short off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: The aroma contains strong floral hops, fruity citrus and caramelized malts.  T: The taste starts out with a strong floral and dank hops bitterness that is followed by a strong fruity citrus sweetness. The malt character is hearty and brings a very good balance. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet.  M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.  O: Very tasty, goes down extremely easily, not too filling, good kick, excellent representation of style, this is a tremendously good 2IPA to drink for a long time.",0.7209952257354109,5.0,0.9766
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Pint canned on 7/10/18 opened up on 7/15/18  The color seems to be that of the New England style ipa standard: a milky golden with tints of white haze and orange juice. Opaque and thick. Creamy white dome, settles down to thin coverage. Only a thin ring of bubbly foam remains with minimal lacing leftover.   A malty scented sweetness of raw honey and golden wheat pops out for me first. Bright citrus fruits, pineapple and orange crush soda from the hops. Zesty grapefruit, tangy, sour-grassy earth in July. Tangerine and lemmon, vanilla and cream topping. The nose is simply an intense delight. Perhaps the most fruity-sweet domininant hoppy nose I've ever had the pleasure of inhaling.  A ling, lush, thick and smooth texture to the body and mouthfeel is most impressive. Certainly fresh, crisp with a zing, but damn silky to boot. The tangy, earthy bitter side of tbe fruity hop flavor hits first with multiple layers of complexity. Sweet tropical fruits, pine, lemmon kick, grapefruit, pineapple and a serious assortment of malty backdrops like, silky wheat, pilsner malt, lactose and dry, herbal effects that come across slightly sweet in the end. Juicy-dry-bitter-sweet-juicy and dry again!   Complexity of hop and malty flavor's is very high. The balance is harmonious and the approach is light and easy, even with the complexity. The hops come across as seriously fresh, green, earthy and amazingly fruity. El Dorado, double dry-hopped is a beauti f u. L thing.",0.7168731719596158,4.5,0.9763

Sip Of Sunshine,"16 oz can poured into a snifter. Canned just over a month ago.  A perfect looking IPA. Vibrant golden yellow with a fluffy finger head that slowly works it way down. Nice lacing and very little carbonation.  Subtle pine, citrus, dank lemon, green apple, and tangerine on the nose.  Taste is perfectly balanced. Lovely hop bitterness combined with pine and tropical notes and a citrusy finish.   Feel is excellent. Crisp, refreshing, and not overly carbonated.  Nearly a perfect beer right here.

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Served in a Paulaner hefeweizen glass, it pours a hazy, solid yet brilliant orange of a yellow hue. It forms a three-finger foamy and creamy head with seemingly everlasting retention.  A bevy of bubbles can be seen going to the surface from the very bottom of the glass, nurturing the head of the beer.  This beer gives a nice lacing.   Lots of banana, mild bubblegum, wheat malts, very strong biscuit, honey, citrus and clove. Assertive and enticing bouquet.  Excellently rounded and subtle.  Upfront the expressive carbonation is felt, and it accompanies the flavor all throughout.  Perfect balance, the sweet notes and the hoppy bitterness are equally present in that uniform yet complex flavor that the carbonation unveils.  Notes of overripe apple, pineapple, banana, biscuit, wheat malts, hay, honey and clove. The aftertaste is long and slightly sweeter, that crispness dissipates.  Medium to full body, slightly silky and very refreshing.   The subtleties and sophistication of this beer's flavor speak for themselves.  World class beer for sure.",0.7295375228053693,4.75,0.9756
Nelson,"Bomber with best by date exactly 60 days into the future. Not sure when this was born, but seems relatively fresh. Cloudy, golden hue with foamy, white head. Looks to be well carbonated.  Smells piney, with strong citrus notes. Grapefruit mostly. Mouthfeel is rather chewy and finishes dry. Clean finish, but not quite crispy. Flavors are bold grapefruit with some pine undertones. Really refreshing and clean ipa. No signs of the alcohol, just a lot of citrus and medium bitterness that grows to the finish.  Overall and excellent, easy drinking ipa. I haven't had a lot of the Alpine beers, but I'll be seeking them out.",0.7139816041223528,4.25,0.9751
Vicinity,"Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip glass (two weeks old). Appearance is hazy yellow/brown with one finger thick head (decent retention). Smell is earthy hops, grapefruit pith, fermented sugar, wheat. It doesn't jump out at you, but the floral hops are pleasant.  Taste started out a little bitter but really grew on me. There is a good amount of grapefruit citrus to balance out the earthy hop flavor. Bitterness is moderate to low and fairly dry. Great medium body with a nice refreshing finish, very refreshing for 8% ABV. Overall, this is another great NE style IPA from Trillium. It doesn't have quite as much flavor or juiciness as some of their other IPAs, but Vicinity is refreshing with great balance and hop flavor.",0.7119803794714767,4.5,0.9735
Society & Solitude #4,"750ml growler, poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass.  The beer pours a super hazy, murky, unfiltered apricot color, hues of orange and honey with a thick, white, soapy head, easily 2 fingers high with very nice retention that yields a lovely network of sticky lace. The aroma is nice, dank yet juicy, citrusy and piney, grapefruit, hop resin, mangos, pineapples and some grassy weediness that brings out the floral qualities, very pungent, with light, doughy malt. The flavors line up very well, huge pine that brings out the earthy, grassy character, big juicy citrus and tropical fruit with some more rustic wildflower flavors, much stronger bitterness than the nose suggested with the signature hill farmstead malt character, chewy and very doughy without being too sweet, just supports the hops while also imparting a touch of bitterness. The mouthfeel is nice, very juicy while coating very well, lively but creamy and soft at times with a very dry finish that lingers nicely.  Verdict: A very nice Double IPA from Hill Farmstead, per usual. Excellent showcase of hops that are both juicy and dank but at times they fight for attention and the bitterness is a bit high and kind of puts a damper on the brightness and delicate nature of the flavors, more aggressive than I'm used to seeing from Hill Farmstead.",0.7137037415388034,4.25,0.9733
Enjoy By IPA,"Canned 3/14/18, consumed 3/25/18  Poured crystal clear honey amber with a decent head that left good lacing.  Aroma is a heavy but balanced whiff of danky and piney hops with citrus fruit. West Coast style amplified.  Taste follows aroma, but the malts come in here. Slightly less fruity than the aroma.  Mouthfeel is heavy, solid bitterness, but everything feels smooth with a clean, dry finish. Nothing lingering.  Overall, a very solid and strong West Coast DIPA offering from Stone. I find their regular IPA to be a bit too bitter; this one here, although much stronger, is far smoother and more balanced. Great price for a tasty, strong DIPA, also a plus.",0.7377858193764889,4.5,0.972
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Solid dark brew, topped by a good size lighter brown head. Very good retention, and wide fields of lacing.  Nutty, boozy aroma. Honey, roasted malts, nuts, caramel, coffee, alcohol, oak, bourbon coming through relatively mild, but building with warmth.  Very smooth flavor. Sweet, but not overmuch. Roasty, but not exceptionally bitter. Strong bourbon notes, but not overpowering or too sickly-sweet.  Chocolate and coffee from the malt; vanilla, oak, and bourbon from the barrel; nuts, honey, and toffee.  Unbelievably smooth mouthfeel; 11.9% and you'd never know it. Silk. Could be a touch thicker, but it's far from thin (think: cheaper, thinner egg-nog, whereas Ten-FIDY is the good stuff).  I guess if I have a complaint, it's that the brew comes across very, very smooth, but not particularly deep or complex. I would love a slightly stronger stout base for the brew; the barrel character in this one is very well integrated, but I don't get as nuanced or complex a flavor profile as I do in FW brews or BCBS.",0.7155157395966665,4.5,0.9719

A: Hazy, dull strawberry. A few bubbles for the head on medium pour.  S: Mostly tart cherrie with hints of oak, yeast, and must. Touch of sweetness as well. Nice!  T: Brisk sour/tartness up-front with mellow oak and light funk towards the back-end. Not overly complex, but just right.   M: Medium bodied with almost no carbonation.   O: A very refreshing and crisp beer. The tart/sourness is wonderfully balanced with the sweetness, which makes this quite enjoyable.",0.7165137755365569,4.5,0.9713
Sip Of Sunshine,"Look - poured from a 16 oz can into an IPA glass. Packaged on 8/23/18. Beer is a beautiful golden color and mostly transparent. Two finger head, with nice lacing, though it does dissipate after a few minutes. Smell - various tropical fruits, supported by a hoppy aroma consisting of a complex mixture of hops. Fairly inviting. Taste - fruitiness dominates the initial taste, followed by a wave of hoppy bitterness and several additional ""waves"" of hoppy flavor that subtly differs. A dry and slightly sweet finish in the end, topping off a very enjoyable experience. Feel - medium bodied and about average carbonation. At 8% ABV, alcohol is well masked, and the beer is very drinkable, perhaps even a bit too much so... Overall - a phenomenal brew. A double IPA that excels at its use of hops, layers of flavor, and its tremendous drinkability. Even though the beer itself is quite hoppy, this is a brew that many (including non-hopheads) may find quite enjoyable.",0.7245999722417531,4.5,0.9701

Solid though the head and color could use a little work.  Notes of citrus, grapefruit, pine and starfruit. A light spritz with a mellow malt body. Moderately aromatic with a decent fruit presence.   Opens grapefruit, pine and starfruit. Juicy and resiny in the middle with a touch of grassiness and pulp. Nice malt body complements a tropical fruit hop bitterness. Aggressively balanced towards the end with just a bit of accented tartness. Aftertaste of more tropical fruit. What a juice bomb!  Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth and quenching in the mouth and crisp and aggressive going down. Dry finish with a filmy, lingering aftertaste. Excellent. Super drinkable and the alcohol is barely there.  Very very good and this one gets better and better as it warms, revealing more aspects of a tasty tropical fruit bouquet.

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2007 vintage, 750 mL capped and corked bottle.   Pours a bright, clear rose color with a large frothy pink head that quickly fades to a ring of tiny bubbles with nice lacing, though each pour from the bottle stimulates a similarly large, appealing head.   Aroma is rich and complex, dominated by tart raspberry, slightly sweet. Underneath the fruit lies a vinegary sour, earthy aroma. Amazing balance of pungent, sharp sour notes with pleasant fruity tart and sweet.   The sour lambic flavors take center stage in the beginning. After a few sips to condition the palate, the sweet and tart raspberry fruit flavors with some lemon zest emerge underneath the funk. Finish is extremely dry and smooth with lingering raspberry notes and mild tartness.  Silky smooth mouthfeel with effervescent carbonation, and is extremely sour and puckering from the flavors described above. A sipper from the complex flavors and sour/funkiness, but not alcohol presence, and pleasant bursts of sweetness make this an exceptional lambic.",0.7308460438486736,5.0,0.9698

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Appearance - Opaque red, 1 finger of head which reduced.  Smell - Very strong, lots of raspberry and oak.  Taste - This has all the fruits, yeast and sourness I would expect from a genuine Lambic. It is hard to explain why this is so enjoyable despite being so sour, it just is.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, lively, very smooth.  Drinkability - Very challenging, as expected.  Overall - I imagine I would enjoy the Kriek more than this.

Hazy yellow and light golden with a moderately sized near-white head eventually leaving lines and spiderwebs of lace down the glass. Pretty.  There's a huge assortment of citrus/fruity hop elements in this: grapefruit, mango, nectarine, and orange; sensing a theme? There's enough bread/biscuit to backbone this nicely.  The flavor is similar to the aroma as the citrus and bright fruit/hop notes stand out, though balanced nicely enough by biscuit and mild caramel. Moderate bitterness; remarkably drinkable.

Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"16oz can, purchased from the brewery, poured into a Trillium Congress Street becher glass. Enjoyed on 12.30.2016, reviewed from Tasting Journal.  The beer pours a turbid and hazy orange color, copper hues with a foamy and soapy white head, good retention and lace. The aroma is decent, juicy peach and mango, citrusy, but strong bitterness, very green and earthy, raw leafy hop with some lime acidity and plenty of sweet grain. The flavors are decent, really green and earthy, leafy hop, definitely overhopped, super bitter, lots of lime forward citrus with some grapefruit peel and a bit of peach character. Sweet grains, pale and soft with some NE yeast character and a bit of tropical fruit grows as the beer warms to room temperature. The mouthfeel is good, coating and thick medium body, super smooth and creamy texture with soft finish that leaves a bit of dryness behind.   Verdict: A decent IPA from Trillium, but definitely overhopped and aggressively bitter. Unbalanced in that regard and very harsh and punishing. Columbus is definitely an aggressive hop and the El Dorado doesn't do much to tame it in any way.",0.7114327397870372,3.75,0.9679
Green,"This is a bit more piny and less citrusy than its sibling Julius. Sweet pine up front, quickly transitions into tropic fruit, primarily mango, and a sweet maltiness. Medium body and a tropical fruit/citrus aftertaste with some pine resin. Really pleased with this one. Flavors are so well balanced that it is easy to detect each without one overpowering and masking the others. Truly a pleasure.",0.7168917014600835,4.5,0.9658
Mastermind,"Pours a cloudy golden straw color with a 1-finger white head. Good retention on the head and leaves a nice crown of lace as it dissipates.   The aroma is very tropical, with notes of ripe mangoes, pineapple, and light melon. Back end has some wet grass and just a touch of pine.   The taste is a nice blend of tropical and citrus flavors, with loads of pineapple leading the way. The malt is equally as present, however, and provides a subtly sweet biscuit character.   The feel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Smooth, yet slightly sticky with a dry finish. Has a slight warmth from the alcohol.  Overall, a very good, very well-balanced beer. The tropical flavors and aromas are nice and the malt provides a perfectly sweet balance to the hops. However, if you're expecting a hop bomb, or something akin to Second Fiddle, you may want to pass on this one given the difficulty it takes to obtain.",0.7231999373449329,4.25,0.9652

Appearance: This pours a cloudy tangerine color with a golden border and a champagne color right at the edge of the glass. A small creamy white head forms initially.  Smell: This is a tightly wound aroma of fruit and sour notes. Nice horse blanket funkiness. Tart apples, sour white grapes, and a little woodiness as well.  Taste: Up front the flavor is quite tart, with tangerine pushing its way to my palate's forefront. An aggressive barnyard flavor comes through.   Mouthfeel: This is very smooth, sour, acidic, and dry. A refreshing carbonation keeps this feeling light.  Overall: Funky, very complex, and quite enjoyable. As my lambic experience grows, this is definitely one I would like to revisit in order to appreciate more of the complexity that I may have missed. Nonetheless a fantastic beer.",0.7109804358927181,4.5,0.9645
Juicy,"L: Darker than I thought it would be; More of a deep amber-hued body with a generous 1cm white foamy head with decent retention S: Tropical fruits, pineapple, mango, and of course a healthy amount of funk on the nose T: Burst of peach, Meyer lemon, and mango is met by a delicate tartness F: Light and pillowy mouthfeel with a lactic coating on the finish O: As malleable a saison as I've ever encountered, Juicy takes on aspects of a tart wild ale, rustic farmhouse ale, and juicy DIPA in a very clean and well orchestrated flavor profile. While I've been nothing but impressed with HF's offerings, Juicy truly separates itself in my perspective. This was a novel beer in many regards to my palate and one I thoroughly enjoyed. While it certainly lives up to its namesake, the soft tartness and delicate mouthfeel only serve to enhance the experience. Nicely done.",0.729673583920023,4.75,0.9638
Enjoy By IPA,"On tap into a pint glass. Pours clear golden color with a two finger head that sticks around and leaves lacing 1/3 way down the glass. Strong but balanced nose of peppery, dank, and citrus hops. Taste is complex but redeeming with pale malt, citrus, pine, and dank hops with clean finish. Medium body and medium high carbonation with a perfectly subtle bitterness. Fantastic IPA. Enjoy by 4/20 isn't over-hyped.",0.7152018654580646,4.5,0.9636
Nectarine Premiere,"On tap at the brewery today.  The beers pours a hazy golden amber color with good head retention and attractive lacing. As good as this beer looks, of course it smells even better. There is a huge pithy aroma of fresh, ripe nectarines (shocker, I know), coupled with light pepper, light vanilla and underlying earthiness (for lack of a better description). This beer smells great. The flavor profile replicates the nose, but the sour component struck me as just a bit much. It blends in well with all the fresh fruit, but it pushes aside the sweetness, leading to some subtle astringency on the finish. The finish is fairly dry otherwise, with plenty of sour pucker power that just lasts and lasts. Alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile, though I wasn't surprised to learn that the abv. was in the 7% range.   Another solid effort from dG, but then what's new.",0.7216635688250542,4.25,0.9633
Enjoy By IPA,"enjoy by 12.25.16 22oz bottle  pours amber/orange, fairly clear  smell - piney and fruity  taste - nice balance of bitter with peachy fruit at the top, piney notes and sweet malt  feel - slightly on the thinner side of medium i would say  overall - highly enjoyable, i'd buy it again. very fresh taste, smell and feel - the hop flavors come alive, all nicely balanced",0.7225453748163514,4.25,0.9632
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"I judge all other Hefewiess against this as the gold standard.  Looks hazy golden. A nice head that quickly dissipated however.  Smells like what you would expect.. yeasty, subtle banana, spice, a bit tangy.  Tastes fantastic. Sharp initially then smooths out letting the yeast, and banana/clove flavors come into play leaving a lingering taste I describe as wheat beer for lack of a better term.   Feel is very good, a bit sharp and drying on the finish, Smooth and very drinkable.  Great beer!",0.7116100702463987,4.75,0.9626
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Pours pitch black with some nice head. Out of a plastic cup at DLD so its not the prettiest but it does the trick. Smells oaky initial which I love. Dark, boozey fruits and wood and malt. Very nice combination of scents. Tastes incredible. Smooth rich roasted flavours, some dark fruits, etc. Incredible mouthfeel... very thick and not highly carbonated. A bit high in alcohol content but overall quite nice",0.7154688810795288,4.5,0.9623
Todd The Axe Man,"16oz can into snifter. Murky dark orange body with a fine ring of lacing and a small head that dissipates quickly. Not hazy like the current craze, more just...murky. Not the prettiest beer but that seems to be of little import for hoppy brews these days.  Aroma is exceptional, very fruity and tropical, with a little sweet biscuit thing detected underneath. The flavor falls just slightly short, not quite as bursting with those fruity characteristics as anticipated, but still quite lovely. The overall vibe is much more Dipa than single; the malt flavors arent simply playing second fiddle, providing some depth and sweetness and mitigating the slightly bitter, grapefruit rind finish.   Body a bit bigger than medium and carbonation slightly under; again these characteristics give the impression of a double. Blindfold I would have guessed this closer to 9% abv.  Good stuff from Surly if not absolute upper echelon or super cutting edge (for what that's worth).",0.710330756235474,4.25,0.9623
Scaled Up,"16oz can, poured into a Trillium etched snifter glass. Enjoyed from a fresh can on 8.23.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal.  The beer pours a bright golden color, apricot and orange hues, hazy and cloudy with a foamy white head, not super tall with little retention yet lots of lace. The aroma is super citrusy, juicy and crisp but also bitter and rindy with a lot of ""green"" overhop character, hop spice, grassiness, pale grain sweetness and some floral scents that linger. The flavors offer a really bitter hop bite, tons of juiciness as well, very sharp citrus flavors, almost a lime like crispness to it with that same overhopped ""green"" character, some sweetness to counterbalance the beer creeps out and again, a bit of wildflower lingers on the tongue. The mouthfeel is nice, medium body, coating, smooth, moderate carbonation with a dry finish.  Verdict: A nice double IPA from Trillium but easily overhopped and unbalanced. Very juicy, tangy, and refreshing, but a bit too bitter, a bit too green and one dimensional with the citrus. While still a nice beer, not quite up to the standard that Trillium usually achieves.",0.7168828380761246,3.75,0.9622
Beatification,"Bottle.  A: Golden color, totally clear, with a thin uniform white head that has solid retention and light lacing in the glass.  A: Earthy funk, with complex wild barnyard aromas light oak and sourness.  T: Bright and crisp with earthy, wild, funky barnyard flavors, give way to a clean, well balanced sourness and dry finish.  M: Medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation.  O: Outstanding, the beer has an amazingly complex earthy, funky, barnyard aroma and flavor, making it delicious to drink and enjoy!",0.7537642234687663,4.5,0.962
Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,"Brilliant copper amber body, clear with some haze from the chill. Three finger white, creamy head with some serious staying power. Nice sticky, web-like lace. Fresh pine and compost in the aroma mingles with tropical fruit, which comes more alive as it warms. The malts are wonderfully bready with a touch of honey. The taste is complex yet balanced. Tropical fruit juices, pineapple, mangos and papaya. Citrus rind and herbal hops towards the middle with a wonderful piney spice at the end. A touch grainy but mostly bready malts. Hints of honey sweetness throughout.  Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Resin like mouth feel but not too heavy. Lovely dry finish with a bite from the alcohol.  Perfect balance between the malt and the hops. Hop profile very balanced for such an aggressive beer.",0.7217046729585802,4.5,0.9612
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Appearance - golden, hazy, cloudy, with a nice foam head Aroma - strong banana, hints of clove.

Beer:Barrel:Time,"Amazing barrel forward stout. Smells like vanilla wafers and charred oak and dark caramel. Baffling complexity combined with sufficient sweetness. And while the booze is currently still fairly intense, I can see this aging beautifully. Mouthfeel was full but as usual is the case in any non-TG beer, I wouldn't have minded a bit more substance there. Altogether of the best barrel aged beers I've ever tasted and perhaps (surprisingly) i enjoyed it even more than any of the Derivations I've had.",0.7126268269971547,4.75,0.9604
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2014 vintage at the brewery.  Pours a deep red, with fine foam.  Smell has a crazy amount of raspberries, complimented by a little bit of funk and some elderflower.  Taste is moderately sour, but sooo refreshing and fruity. Raspberries, some lime and a bit of hay are the main notes, and it's so deep and complex. The flavors just keep evolving as it warms. Awesome stuff!  Mouthfeel is thin and prickly.  Overall, an amazing fruit lambic, so complex and enjoyable.",0.7304727251407861,4.75,0.96
Todd The Axe Man,"Pours a slightly hazed orange color with a small, soon vanishing white head.  Smells of cake coated citrus pulp, together with a subtle blueberry quality. Citrus fruits are dominating the nose in a pleasant way, getting depth from a pithy quality, as well as a flowery softness and dough. There is also a bright note of orange pulp atop the lemon, together with some old ginger, producing an awesomly well smelling beer.  Has a soft medium carbonation, perfectly illustrating the refreshing nature of this beer, while displaying a noteable flavor depth, featuring a solid, sweet malt balance. The beer stays soft on the tongue throughout, while its different flavors come together perfectly.  Tastes of an initial lime bitterness, which immediately gets coated by toffeeish, cakey malts, with the lemon regaining a flowery depth afterwards. The hops take a fruity turn then, revealing passion fruit and orange, which are tied to the omnipresent lemon all the time. Develops a powerful, bitter dryness during the finish, in which a herbal note adds to the hops, and the present malt backbone shrinks to a balancing minimum, providing a note of required dough.  This is an awesomly well made ipa. It is juicy, bitter and refreshing, while integrating a nowadays almost uncommon malt note. This maltiness really does enrich the hops though, which would be a little to harsh and one dimensionally straight forward on the palate otherwise.",0.7411602284722739,4.25,0.9588
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Yeasty, fairly dry, and a reasonable barrel presence - wine notes are subtle, but grapes can definitely be distinguished. The nose is just a bit floral and quite pleasant.  Light, but thick, and quite easy to drink. Complex. Very good.",0.7526092632860859,4.25,0.9585
Aaron,"Had on tap. Pretty close to a perfect execution of the english barleywine style with the american bourbon aging flare incorporated beautifully. The feel and smell are mesmerizing with their richness and complexity. All aspects, including the taste, have the barrel character meld wonderfully with the barleywine malt, barley and yeast. Bravo!",0.7158703506000781,4.75,0.9583
Schaerbeekse Kriek,Cloudy bright red colour with no head. Actually quite cloudy. Good.  Nicely funky aroma with a tart edge. Very sour cherries. Good.  A complex balance of soured cherry and funk. Very lightly bitter although that may be astringency. I quite like this.  Medium light body with moderately-high carbonation. Good and not overly puckering.  A balanced yet tart Kriek. Good cherry flavour and quite nice on the whole though it doesn't blow me away.,0.7392648510973361,4.0,0.9583
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Impressive complexity and mouthfeel. Just a hair drier than most imperial Stouts, but anything but thin. It's expensive yes. But it's also amazing.  oh, also has the best balance of barrel flavors with the base beer.",0.7162415348098778,4.75,0.9565
Todd The Axe Man,"Look: Really nice golden, leaning toward amber, color. Decent head retention. Smell: Awesome! Fresh pine and grass, with heavy citrus notes, something like orange peel and grapefruit Taste: Similar to the nose, citrus flavor really shines, with some of the pine/grass bitterness in there for balance Feel: Extremely smooth. Dangerously slow, as this beer is extremely easy to just keep drinking.  Overall: One of the best beers I've had, and a near perfect example of an IPA!",0.7188741557758688,4.75,0.9565
Juicy," a hazy amber color with a half-finger of off-white head. The head settles into a halo, leaving some lacing as it dissipates.   The aroma is bright, tart, and complex. Sour apples, grapes and lemon rind up front. Grassy and quite hoppy. Back end is full of vanilla oak and caramel notes, as well as plenty of doughy yeast.   The flavor follows the nose. Tart and citrusy on the front end, hoppy and vegetal in the middle. Finishes very doughy and yeasty, with plenty of vanilla, caramel, and some slight funk.   The body is medium-light, with moderate carbonation. Goes down smooth and very creamy. Lightly crisp and fairly dry. Faint lingering acidity.   Overall, a fantastic farmstead ale that is extremely flavorful and complex. It's a perfect balance of sweet, hoppy, and tart, with just enough funk to remind you what kind of beer you are enjoying.",0.7291306737990692,4.5,0.9565
Scaled Up,"Cloudy like all Trillium unfiltered beers. The color is dirty gold. Modest head which settles to the finest film of bubbles. There's a few spots for lace.   The smell is complex with a bit of bubblegum, berry fruitiness, and mild flowery hop. Attractive ask and inviting.   A smooth DIPA with a solid malt base. The dominates but doesn't mask the base. The beer is rich with an above average carbonation level. The finish is peppery and oddly refreshing (crisp) given the style. The aftertaste is not exclusively bitter; I get light berry sweetness as well.",0.7306660765337939,4.0,0.9562
Beatification,"Batch 5.  Beautiful clear golden pour with minimal carbonation. Metallic nose, huge lemon juice quality on the palate. This is straight-up citrus, not vinegar. Finishes clean with a big-time mineral quality.   Interesting beer, not complex but an impressive showcase of the flavors it does have. I imagine it being served ice cold accompanying some delicious fresh seafood. Out of that context maybe it's more of a curiosity.",0.7285048369157837,4.0,0.9557
Darkstar November,"Excellent BA stout, really gives you the best parts of the style, an ample body without being too heavy or flat, great barrel character, and a particularly deft use of molasses/rye to properly balance sweetness with light spice/barrel+grain char bitterness. Impressive.",0.7314057593087236,4.5,0.9552
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Pours viscous with almost no head to speak of; yet after that viscous pour, it sits cola brown in the glass with a fair amount of light passing through around the edges. Smell is heavily chocolate forward balanced nicely by a robust barrel character. The coffee comes through as the third most distinct smell. Slight hint of vanilla from the barrels along with some nice balanced roasted note. Taste follows the smell for the most part. Slightly sweet up front and the coffee comes through in the middle much more prevalently than in the nose. The overall taste of the beer is very bourbon county esque with a slight roasty coffee note. Not a coffee bomb at all, though it still manages to peek out independently. Also get some floral spicy notes that is a nice touch. It feels deliciously silky, but it is a tad too light. Something about the beer gives you a watery impression Tonito body but it objectively speaking rather thick and full bodied. Overall this beer is excellent but there is a lack of balance in the mouthfeel that prevents it from being truly world class.",0.7121820676872385,4.5,0.9535
Swish,"Drank on tap at The King's Head, Portland, ME Served in a Bissell Brothers stemless wine glass  The beer poured a slightly hazed, light golden amber and was topped by an inch tall, frothy, eggshell colored crown. Solid retention. Spotty droplets of lacing coated the glass.  Fantastic aroma. Super fruity and bright. Tropical fruits dominated. Papaya, guava and pineapple came through strongest. Fairly sweet. There was a dank, weed-like quality as well. Touch of lemon. Grapefruit notes appeared as the beer warmed.  The flavor profile was drastically different from the nose. It too was super hoppy but also remarkably pithy and dry. The hops had an intense catty quality. Loads of white grapefruit. Uber lemony. Fairly grassy. The beer finished with an intensely dry and bitter, lemon rind-like quality. Moderately tart. The pithy, bitter notes lingered long after every sip.  The mouthfeel was surprisingly light for the style. Frothy and fluffy. The liquid contained a super fine, semi-aggressive, almost Champagne-like carbonation. Rather odd and a bit disappointing.  I typically love intensely hoppy double IPAs, but Bissel Bothers's Swish was far too dry and pithy for my palate. Perhaps a bigger mouthfeel and more rounded flavor profile could improve things significantly.",0.7169143774569089,3.5,0.9532
Todd The Axe Man,"Faintly hazy, bright gold colored body with a relatively thin yet lasting head, a bit soapy, a bit creamy. Powerful scent of citrus and pineapple; orange, lemon; very light note of light grain. Huge juicy flavor infused with a striking yet balanced hop bitterness; grapefruit; subtle cracker notes. Medium bodied; crisp and dry with a bit of alcohol dryness, too.   An outstanding beer with a nice ABV punch, balanced and delightful in all respects.",0.7498839431563084,4.25,0.9531
Sang Noir,"Cracked a bottle of this recently for my birthday. A truly superb beer that showcases the excellent balances of this brewery. Nicely tart, but with a depth of lush fruit and a firm backbone of barrel aging. The sour cherries in this are mouthwatering, and the bourbon adds such a nice complexity. A masterpiece.",0.7285059848503496,4.25,0.9528
Nectarine Premiere,"I think this is a little over hyped, but is still very solid. The most outstanding factor is the deep nectarine juicy-ness of the beer. I mean it has the essence of jammy. But the flavor is pretty one dimensional after that, tart, clean, smooth, decent body,",0.7267159398813348,4.5,0.9526
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"I’ve had Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier many times and I just had it again. I think it is a great Hefeweizen. I love it for its balanced and moderate but distinct flavors and for being such a classic Hefewezien and yet such a great beer.  Look: golden hazy hue with very thick (three-inch) white foamy head.  Aroma: The aroma is wheat, yeast, banana and maybe a tad citrus.  Taste: the usual Hefeweizen flavors wheat, yeast, banana, a little bit cloves and maybe a hint of orange but the flavors are just really well composed and well balanced.  Feel: The body is light to medium and it's crisp and thirst quenching.",0.7207425296024941,4.5,0.9515
Mastermind,"Canned on 2/21/19  Pours a deeply hazy dulled lemon gold topped with a finger or so of creamy white head; retention is very good, and results in a thin plastering of consistent lacing all around the glass, as well as a light collar of foam.  Aroma presents big notes of smooth herbal sweetness with a light citric touch; bits of orange zest, passionfruit, lemon/lime, and something resembling dank aloe tones; unique, in-your-face, but very appealing and smooth.  Taste bursts with orange juice, passionfruit, lemon zest, and plenty of subtle dank citrus; that familiar bit of herbal sweetness from the aroma appears on the finish, along with some noticeable doughy, bready malt tones.  Mouthfeel shows a medium body with a lighter touch and spectacular dose of steadily building carbonation. Mostly dry with a faint bitterness across the palate with a fast encroaching juiciness from the mid-palate onward; evolves to one of the juiciest takes on the style I’ve come across to date, and in spite of the occasional thinning, this more than establishes its incredibly high-level approachability.  Ridiculously juicy with a great citrus profile and supporting sweet, herbal dankness; easy to drink any time no doubt, but warm weather would suit this one perfectly.",0.7312471789305991,4.25,0.9514
Nelson,"22oz bomber poured into two stemless wine glasses (somewhere between a table-glass and a snifter). Pours an intensely hazy peach-straw color with a rapidly dissipating 1 finger white head leaving mild lacing with good moderate retention. Nose is dry piney hops and bright citrus fruits - lemon, orange, and kiwi. The palate opens with fruits very much in line with the nose: kiwi most prominently, with lemon undertones, which then give way to a strong hop body, with appropriately subtle rye notes. Rye so commonly overpowers the IPAs it inhabits, but in this case, it is a perfect companion, adding to the flavor and deepening the complexity, without dominating the palate. A not-insignificant malt presence is perceptible on the back-end of the palate. The mouthfeel is medium, chewy, with mild to moderate combination. Overall, an extraordinary IPA, with a phenomenal level of complexity, though the malt elements are perhaps more dominant than is fashionable in modern-day IPAs. The one-line assessment: a tremendously layered beer, well worth the purchase.",0.7338344105476627,4.5,0.9503
Sip Of Sunshine,Excellent dry hoppy IPA that hides its alcohol content well. I really enjoyed its clean finish and complex taste. Easy to enjoy multiple brews as this lacks the heaviness of other IPAs.,0.7128313227892791,4.25,0.9498
Beer:Barrel:Time,"The 2017 whale in the flesh. The feature of the night’s share.  Pitch black viscous pour. It boasts a dark tan head, with medium lace that decorates the inside of the glass.. preparing for what’s to come.  Dark fruit, boozy, bourbon nose. It’s not overly complex, but it feeds from the important components of the beer: the barrel, the malt, and time itself (to marinate, of course).  Flavors are characterized by a tobacco intro, with a complex balance of subtle dark chocolate, roasty malts throughout, and smooth booze to finish it out. All the while a sweet fudginess sneaks its way into the backbone of this beer’s amazing flavor profile.  Creamy, smooth body. The mouthfeel is thick and viscous, with a nice burn as it goes down. It’s not overwhelming, and for such a big beer it’s predominantly subtle.",0.7276416600598533,5.0,0.9493
Nelson,"BBD 6/18/16. Pours a hazy gold with a touch of amber. Outstanding head volume, world class lacing and retention.  World class nose of tropical hops (mango, pineapple), citrus (orange) and a strong dank background over a touch of biscuit.  Heavy light body with a smooth texture that has an oily slick element. World class carbonation with a nice effervescent middle that coats the tongue and a finely bubbled prickly finish.  The flavor profile is borderline world class. Complexity is a bit weak, but the intent is to showcase the Nelson Sauvin hop and that is done in a world class fashion. Balance is perfect for the objective as a subtle cracker biscuit sweetness arrives in the middle to contrast a tasty bitterness that is quite mild for the style. Hop flavor is the name of the game with this one. The flavors of the nose all arrive...citric followed by tropical as the sweetness of the middle allows the tropicals to shine. Then a significant dankcentric element takes command and holds through the finish. The finish hints at dryness initially, but makes a lingering flourish underneath an amazing blend of tropical and dank hop flavor. This is a bomber...Alpine / GF, 6 pack this bad boy!!",0.7186601514466768,4.5,0.9481

Swish,"Thanks Blue_Rogue. This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a glazed over yellow/slight orange color. The head dissipated immediately. Light lacing stuck only around the glass. The smell had a wonderful sweet to lightly spiced combination of raw piney and grapefruit. Adequately enthralled with the substance of the bitter sweet citrus hops, a light burst of sweet onion runs into the aroma and blends wonderfully. The taste took all of those previously mentioned flavors and amplifies to flavor. There’s no aftertaste nor finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation hits like a good DIPA should but still isn’t overbearing. A lingering semi - soft bitter dryness rolls over my tongue. Overall, I say this was a very good DIPA that I would love to have again.",0.7115127020081996,4.0,0.9468

Oude Geuze Vintage,"375ml, red label, 2005 vintage received as an extra from PALMEJ1! Thanks a ton Jacob! You are a madman.   Pours a cloudy, very dark golden range color golden tangerine/burnt orange hues when held to a light and a one finger frothy white head that slowly fades into a lasting ring. Sporadic spots of lacing left behind.  Funky, earthy aroma with a heavy barnyard/horsey presence that is countered by crisp light fruit and sweet vinegar. Subtle lactic presence. A bunch of earthy oak along with the funky bugs as well as some grassy straw, cobwebs and musty funk. Hints of apple, pear, grape and tangerine. Extremely complex nose that has my mouth watering. I literally smelled this beer for ten minutes before taking the first sip.   Medium bodied yet fuller than expected with an intensely sour, mouth-puckering flavor that lingers throughout into a sweet, slightly acidic, vinegary tart finish. Very dry and tart up front with only slight acidity in the finish. No solvent or harsh acetic character at all. Extremely funky with lots of earthy oak tannins, bugs and a touch of vinaigrette which is balanced by a slight lactic presence as well as some light fruit. Hints of apple, pear and lemon combined with the vinegar character give this beer a sweet and tart lingering finish that leaves me drooling for another sip. After the initial palate shock this beer proves to be incredibly complex, well balanced and flavorful.   Overall, I had very high expectations for this beer and they were exceeded. With all of it's complexity it is still incredibly quaffable. I absolutely loved this beer and hope to get another bottle sometime.",0.7154086081620641,4.5,0.9455

High quality stuff with great availability.",0.7176695168231633,3.75,0.9453
Nelson,It's a light gold color. The appearance is not representative of the overall huge flavor it has. The smell is fresh like orange juice and very piney.

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Absolutely shocked that I had never reviewed this one before, as I consider it a (the?) defining example of the style.  Golden color, somewhat cloudy. Pours a monster head, creamy and lingering.   Almost a pilsner like spicy note on the nose initially. A soft, slightly sweet and clove nose as it warms a bit. Slight hint of a sweeter fruity banana kind of aroma.   A slightly sweet and clove flavor up front, fairly balanced despite no apparent hop flavors. A very rounded flavor, incredibly smooth with no rough edges. Not overpowering with banana/clove types of flavors - fairly clean palate for a hefe   MF - Medium body and medium to high carbonation. Surprisingly creamy despite the carbonation.   An incredibly easy drinking beer that has the hefeweizen flavor notes without being overpowering.",0.7380994690910755,4.5,0.9434
Vicinity,"16oz. can into a Surly teku. 9/7/16 canning date.   Paler than their other offerings but pretty average overall. Aroma is that of starfruit and citrus. Decent but pretty simple. Beer opens honeydew and citrus with some sugary sweetness and syrup in the middle. There's a hint of pine and grass in the back but the hop bitterness is pretty subdued and drowned out by the big tropical fruit malt character throughout. Refreshing, crisp and clean on the palate and bone dry going down and in the finish.   This one doesn't stand out to me... that doesn't mean its not good though. A pretty solid interpretation of a NE IPA.",0.7147853949619548,4.5,0.9427
Green,"16oz can dated 8/30/17.  Pours milky yellow with a dense, frothy head of white. Nice lacing with decent retention. Aromatics are floral and almost pungent. White grapes, candied pear, peach, mango, and pineapple. Medium bodied with a soft, fluffy mouthfeel. Tropical fruit on the palate with juicy overtones and a light bitterness. Zero malt with loads of ripe citrus. Finishes with lingering lush citrus and super smooth.   Great beer. Plenty of hoppy, juicy goodness without being harsh or tiring, The mouthfeel is amazingly soft and lush especially when the glass is swirled. Almost as good as Galaxy Cutting Tiles!",0.7150387980474497,4.5,0.9425
Sip Of Sunshine,"This is a super solid DIPA. The smell is bursting with dank sticky hops, over ripe fruits, and a hint of honey sweetness. The taste is balanced leaning towards hoppy with firm bitterness. This is what a DIPA should really be. Some reviewers seem to be under the impression this is a NEIPA but it is not. It's a proper American IPA - solid malt backbone balanced perfectly with huge hop flavors, and ending with a strong bitter finish. yb",0.7098170176514502,4.5,0.9418
Swish,"Pint can (3/23/18) poured into a fat Duvel tulip glass on 3/30/18   A thick, totally opaque orange and gold color with white hazy tints. Robust, all-white foam topping. Bubbly and dense. Surprisingly, the foam eventually totally fades away. Minimal lacing.   The aroma popping out of this glass is very strong. A multitude of fruity hop effects, including : peppery citrus, mango, peppery alcohol heat,...big citrus and tropical combo. The malt gives a certain sweetness and earthiness from the wheat. This is the quintessential New England Style DIPA nose. Bold and beautiful hops.   Oh. Sh!%+ !! The density and complexity of this hoppy liquid is unreal. The mouthfeel and texture is about as heavy, full and lush as it gets for this style. Deep, citrus follwed by a biting earthiness from the hops. Pineapple, grapefruit, mango, orange peel...?it's all in there. The malt aspect is also very impressive with a light toned but heady dose of wheat and a crisp but long bite. The light effect and crisp bite turns into slick and full pretty fast to the finish. Orange rind, black pepper, mango and starfruit type flavor dominates in the end. Complexity and depth of hoppy charecter is off the charts.  A full bodied DIPA and huge complexity makes this a true sipper. Not very crushable due to it's heady nature. Take time to ponder it's full-on hop attack slowly! There are some sour, malty risiduals with a bigger than average alchol kick that also limits it's crushability. This thing is destroying my tastebuds. Saturating my palate. I'm done.",0.7291880122983859,4.5,0.9417
Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street,"Pours a rich, golden hue of orange with an opaque transparency. Head foams up to two fingers in height and white in color, and retains well with a few dashes of lacing left behind. Aroma is orange and citrusy, floral and earthy, and dank. Lots of hop qualities that all perform well, and avoid the citrus dripping aromas of similar beers. Flavor profile is citrus, floral, earthy, and dank. Orange juice notes intertwine to develop an interesting flavor profile. Interesting in the sense that it's in-ordinary, and yet is flavored extremely well with a balance that leans more on the sugary side of the sweet vs. bitter. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a smooth texture that only has a fine amount of fizz to it. Overall, this beer drinks resoundingly smooth, with an interesting hop profile. The variation from the typical hop notes spewed by beers of this style, paired with the smooth feel makes this one incredible ""North East"" IPA.   Served in a 12oz snifter.",0.7314409897667491,4.5,0.9413
Peche 'n Brett,"Poured from the 750 bottle into a large tulip. Pours a rich and glowing honey color with depth. Huge soapy head. Aromas are unique combination of brett yeast and peach. Taste is complex. The brett is tamped down by the peach but they mix to create something unique. Moutfeel was very nice. Overall this beer is unique, complex and delicious. Tons of fruit here.",0.715314778053903,4.25,0.9412
Nelson,"January 14, 2016  16.6 oz. bottle, tulip  A – Medium gold, bright even though it’s mildly hazy. An inch of somewhat craggy, bright white foam sits atop the liquid, with long slow retention.   S – Grapefruit juice, a touch of kiwi, and lemon spritzer all contribute to a strong, dominant hop profile. Light, crackery malt with a bit of sourdough bread impression.   T – A whole lot of grapefruit, perhaps of the ruby red variety, with a light lemon note in the background. Flour/cracker malt profile. Bitterness comes and goes but is strong on the finish and aftertaste.  M – Slightly sweet and slick, not as sudsy/carbonated as it appears to be, though still moderate. Medium body. Bitterness rises and takes over on the finish. At no point is there any real balance are harmony.  O – Fantastic aroma and flavor, lacking in the mouthfeel. Never quite feels cohesive.",0.7173362794189001,3.75,0.9409
Flora,"Batch 6. Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Hill Farmstead stemmed wine glass.   Pours a slightly hazy orange body with a big frothy white head that leaves spotty lacing and a layer of retention.   Aromas are mesmerizing, citrus and tart green apple, funk and oak, brett, peppery saison yeast. As it warms the aromas get more potent and inviting. Can't wait to try it.   On the tongue is a balanced, delicate tartness, citrus and dry tart fermented fruit, delicious funk, peppery yeast, moderate oak presence on the follow through. Easy drinker, crisp and delicate, medium carbonation and light but flavorful body.   A true showcase of how micro-flora can work to make a beer world class. Amazing.",0.7139860016405659,4.5,0.9406
Society & Solitude #4,Tap pour into tulip. Smaller head with minimal retention and nice medium sticky lacing. Aroma is assertively citrus and dank tropical fruit.

Oude Geuze Vintage,"11/27/10  2002 with the old red label and a hand written date.  A: Beautiful vibrant dark orange with great clarity and a big frothy white head, great retention.  S: A nice balance of citrus, oak, tannins, and wet leather. Very expressive, yet exhibits excellent balance. Barnyard, hay, some light cheese notes. Really opens up after 20 minutes.  T: Light tartness and low lactic sour notes up front with moderate oak notes and some tannins. Leather, cheese, some citrus notes, and a light acidity. Finish seems to drop off quickly, with just a little lingering oak and tannins.  M: lower high level of carbonation. Dry mouthfeel with tannic notes.  Overall: A nice Gueuze, but lacks the complexity I'd hoped for, especially in the finish.",0.7229212370837035,4.0,0.9396
Society & Solitude #4,"Society & Solitude #4 pours a thick, hazy and golden pear juice looking yellow with a big 2-finger, white and complex head, with excellent retention and lacing. The smell is juicy with a big, clean and bright citrus presence, like a tall glass of orange juice and tangerine with a hint of mango and a mild candied sweetness. The taste is excellent! Nice and smooth over the palette with a balanced citrus flavor with a mild creaminess but not overly thick. Juicy orange up front with some berry, a sweet candied melon and a grassy yet subtle dank characteristic.",0.7139930786916855,4.75,0.9387
Second Fiddle,"Been wanting to try this for years. Finally distribution has reached me. Honestly, for me, better than Heady and Sip (I love both of them!). They are of similar style but Second Fiddle seems more balanced. Don’t expect haze because it’s more of an amber color but has that NE soft mouthfeel. Smooth aggressive tropical hops with balanced malt mix so well.. Crisp and well made this an easy drinking treat.",0.7435191216417063,4.5,0.9348
Society & Solitude #4,"8/17/2012  Huge thanks for the generosity. Much appreciated.   A: Hazy pale yellow with an inch of soapy white froth that lingers for a minute before settling to a thin layer of sea foam. Sheets of lacing coat the glass. Pretty hazy.  S: I'm immediately struck by pineapple, followed by nectarine, pine, papaya, and a floral-like spiciness with a dash of lemon. There's a light cracker and biscuit malt presence that's dominated by the grim and unyielding hop aromatics.  T: A juicy blend of nectarine, orange, stone fruit, and grapefruit rind with a light spiciness. There's a light crackery malt presence that's overwhelmed by a smooth upper moderate bitterness and a plethora of hop flavor. The finish is pleasantly clean and crisp without a hint of alcohol.  M: Lower medium body with upper medium carbonation. Dry and sticky mouthfeel.  Overall: Another excellent Double IPA from Hill Farmstead. Thanks again.",0.710884469890891,4.5,0.9345
Sip Of Sunshine,"Weirdo thing to say - but sometimes there is almost this celery-like finish to crisp, hoppy, but balanced dipas. This kind of taste is best described as slightly sweet, slightly minty, slightly grassy, and all the way smooth. The body is what defines this beer though - leaves what could be a train wreck dancing across the palette. Well done, really unique beer. Don't rope this in with the others.

Smell- citrusy  Taste- citrusy, grapefruit, subtle pine notes, exquisitely balanced, great finish. Feel- slightly under carbonated leading to a thin feel. Overall- An absolutely awesome beer, one of my all time favorites. The only imperfection, in my opinion, was a slight under carbonation leading to a bit of a thin feel. Otherwise a perfect beer for my palate.",0.7168224261228732,4.75,0.9312

S: Pretty intense aroma. Citrus rind, muskiness, soft cheese, overripe raspberry, clean lactic acidity, a bit of wheat and malt sweetness underneath.  T: Moderately strong acidity comes through first, followed by faint oak and mineral, lemon, subtle vanilla, some gamey hay. The taste is cleaner than the aroma.  M: Light-bodied, very light carbonation, soft feel.  O: Although this isn't the best geuze from Armand, it certainly has an intensity (especially in the aroma) that not many other blends can match. Very nice.",0.712583796127795,4.5,0.9281
Enjoy By IPA,"04.20.17  This iteration of Stone's Enjoy By IPA is a crystal-clear, finely effervescent golden beer topped by a giant, off-white pebbly head; retention is good and lacing is excellent, consisting of thick, fine-grained bands and ladders. The nose is medium in intensity; it leads with biscuity malt, which is quickly overridden by a nice blend of grapefruit and cannabis with hints of perfume and tamarind. Alcohol overtones are deceptively slight. Up front, the palate is medium-bitter pineapple and nutty, caramelly malt; mid-palate, the biscuity malt foundation presaged by the nose shows itself prominently, and the hops expand to include grapefruit notes and a bit of grassiness. Perceived bitterness rolls back to moderate in the face of the malt onslaught, and alcohol undertones are considerable. The finish is a good hit of boozy, nutty caramel, and is modestly astringent; the linger is a surprisingly modest resinous pine bitterness that lasts for awhile. Mouthfeel is on point for the medium body, and is moderately astringent; the texture is slightly creamy and medium-peppery from the well-expressed carbonation.

Aaron,"Poured out as a deep brown color with a very small ring of head on top. The smell is loaded with heavy malt aromas and subtle Barrel in there too. The taste is rich, plethora of malt flavors in there with hints of bourbon. The mouthfeel is smooth, but it's got a heavy body to it which is perfect for the style.

Vicinity,"Canned on 8/21  Notes from 8/22:  Pours a light opaque orange with a thin head. Smells very hoppy, with strong citrus-y, mango-y notes. Taste is spicy and citrus-y, bright fruit character and a light malt character. There's an odd (but not unpleasant) garlicky note. Lingering bitterness typical of a DIPA. Mouthfeel is silky, lightly carbonated, and has a dry finish. A fresh, well-made IPA. Gonna wait a week and see if this improves, based on the recent talk of Trillium brews being ""too young"" at times.  Notes from 8/30: Pour is understandably the same. Hop smell has mellowed slightly, giving way to more mango and citrus. The spicy taste has mellowed out and the hop bitterness really shines through now, and the orange and mango flavors give just enough sweetness to balance it. Not as bitter as a lot of DIPAs I've had. Incredibly well balanced, and drinkable with a smooth mouthfeel.",0.7100822073209944,4.25,0.9194
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2013  2008 vintage poured into Lost Abbey stemware.  A: Dark red with a slight orangish hue and an inch of pinkish beige froth.  S: The aroma displays an absurd amount of jammy, tart, pungent raspberry seed and flesh. It's extremely aromatic and vibrant, with an almost spicy character due to its concentration. There's a lightly sweet crackery malt foundation beneath the fruit. Oak and leather blend with earthy funk. There's a bit of vinegar in there.  T: Sweet and tart raspberry seed and flesh with jammy notes and a subtle malt presence. The fruit is explosive and abnormally expressive. Face meltingly, devastatingly, depressively fruity. Lactic, leathery, and oaky, with a delicious tartness throughout. Vinegar is light in the flavor and there's a pervasive but subtle acetic acidity throughout. Finishes heavy on the fruit with a refreshing tartness and a firm but gentle lactic presence.  M: Upper light to lower medium body with high carbonation. The mouthfeel is sticky, dry, and tannic.  Overall: By far the best bottle of Lou Pepe Framboise I've tried, though I've only had the beer a few times and mostly from older bottles. This was exceptional with a radical funky fruit presence. Highly recommended.",0.7136190495747902,4.75,0.9178
Enjoy By IPA,"Pours a opaque orange color with a large fluffy white head. Excellent retention and moderate lacing.  Aroma is a burst of citrus and pine, very nicely balanced.   Taste contains many traits of an excellent IPA, all contained in one beer! Pine, citrus and malt are present right off the bat. The citrus have a sweet, candied quality to them. Good amount of bitterness on the back end, with a dry finish. Definitely has a stronger malt presence than you'll typically see in IIPA's, but its a welcome addition.  Medium bodied and disturbingly drinkable for its ABV.

Society & Solitude #4,"On tap at Positive Pie. Served out of a Hill Farmstead snifter. Reviewed from notes.   Served with a .5 finger white head which dissipated quickly. Spotty lace with good stick. Beer is cloudy honey. Clarity hurts, but solid on all other fronts.  Nose is honey, citrus, sap hop bitterness, papaya, peach, and other tropical fruit. Moderately aromatic. Very good.  Opens citrus sweetness. Papaya, tree sap hoppiness packs a bitter punch that's balanced out by a tropical fruit malt body that emerges towards the middle. Citrus comes out even more towards the end. Finishes with a hop creaminess that fades into a bitter aftertaste. Perfect.  Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Abrasive and lively in the mouth and smooth going down. Messy finish with a lingering aftertaste. Complements the flavor profile amazingly.  Another outstanding hoppy offering from Hill Farmstead.

Aroma gives you those health food store wheatgrass citrusy lemon precursors on top of grain.  All of that comes out in the taste. Pretty full bodied mouthfeel kind of stuff. The format 500ml is a little expensive compared to 12oz offerings, but this is some pretty good benchmark for the hefeweizen style.

The combination of flavors is like tropical cucumber melon - if you will.  MF is on point. Expertly balanced. So velvety smooth.

Fairly intense, as promised.",0.7302407187241522,4.75,0.9081
Beatification,"Beatification batch 5  Pours a filtered, light yellow color and a fizzy, bubbly head, immediately dissapearing into small sheets of lacing.  Lower carbonated, with a very refreshing mouthfeel to it, due to fresh lemons and a balancing, wooden oak infusion.   The aromas unfold just after popping open the bottle, filling the air in my room with a lovely, citrussy funkiness. Reveals even more ripe, juicy citrus when smelling at the actual beer, together with an immense tartness, bedded on glue, yogurt and old leather. Creates an interesting interplay between dough, soft old malts and prickly, crisp lemon, without becoming intriguingly complex.  The taste offers a good amount of lemon right from the very beginning, accompanied by easing, bready, musty malts and fermented wheat. Lemons get increasingly more body added, resulting in a very sour, funky tartness, almost numbing the front of my tongue during its peak. Finishes fruity, with fresh pressed lemons, revealing even lemon stones, as for how pronounced the fruit acidity gets, offering an acceptable dryness.   The balancing oaky barrel vanishes completely during the beers finish, opening the palate up to pure, sour fruit lemonade. Hammers a bit too hard on the palate, regarding its acidic sourness, preventing the beer from showcasing its other, more subdued flavors.",0.7248368904795082,3.0,0.9065

Oude Geuze Vintage,"Pours a nice, hazy orange with a vigorous head. Aroma is a tropical blast of pineapple with some Bretty notes; the balance is definitely toward the fruit.

Oude Geuze Vintage,"750mL, Vintage 2006, from notes on 3/27/11.  Pours a clear strawberry-blond, brilliant for the style. The head is small and wispy.  The nose is pungently funky in a woody, resiny way, along with some earthy and plastic-phenolic notes. Excellent.  Huge tartness is immediately revealed. Borderline harsh sourness is near Cantillon territory. The fruitiness comes mid-palate, with apple, grapefruit and sour cherry notes. Oaky barrel flavor is apparent, and the finish is acidic, dry, and bitter. The mouthfeel has surprisingly low carbonation, so this drinks almost like apple juice. Really, really sour and funky apple juice that is.  I don't know about this one. It was quite the complex sour experience, but I was expecting something smooth and refined with all the age on it. I enjoyed the standard 3 Fonteinen Gueuze more. Worth a try, it might be your thing.",0.7146217222335766,3.5,0.8966

While fruit forward, the beer retained its farmhouse heritage and did not deviate like some over-fruited saisons unfortunately can.

The nose is a beautiful balance between neutral oak, raspberries, sour yeast, and cherries. The taste is right in line with the nose. Moderate level of tartness. Moderate carbonation, fairly thin, moderate smoothness.   This is not sweet or syrupy. This has a strong raspberry flavor that is tight in line with the tart level and influence from the barrel.

Todd The Axe Man,"Canned on 7/5/19  Pours a moderately hazed burnt orange, sizeable, tight, off-white head of foam; great retention yields a massive collar and a lasting dose of thinner, soapy lacing strewn around the glass.  Aroma begins with weedy grapefruit before giving way to a floral, mineral-like quality washing over suggestions of tropical citrus and wild berries.  Taste intersperses pineapple, herbal peach, flaky malt, and floral berries, throughout an evenly balanced profile, with milder notes of dank blueberry appearing sporadically.  Mouthfeel displays a medium body gliding across the palate, with equally moderate carbonation guiding to a light grit on the finish; exceptionally consistent and mildly fluffy; slightly bitter as the swallow sets in.  Delicately floral, tropical, and slightly weedy, this is like Racer 5 met Crusher: an incredibly deep hop experience that stays on the better side of crushable even as it pulls its profile across varying ends of the flavor spectrum.",0.7290964841871648,4.25,0.8858

Swish,"Pours a hazy, orange-juice color with a decent white head. Leaves an OK amount of lacing.   The aroma is very citrus forward but has a nice balance. I get notes of grapefruit and mango, as well as notes of what I can only describe as dank ass kush. Not what I expect from a top-notch New England DIPA but it's a pleasant aroma nonetheless.   The taste is very tropical, with notes of tangerine, mango, and even something I can only assume is lime. It's well-balanced as well, as the doughy malt and lingering pine bitterness provide a very nice backbone.  The feel is medium bodied with decent carbonation. Alcohol is non-existent. Nice and creamy with a bitter character lingering after every sip.   Overall, a very good DIPA. It's creamy, hoppy as hell, and well-balanced. A bit overpriced and perhaps not worth waiting in line for 3 hours for, but still very good.",0.7120785932077068,4.25,0.8749
Black Tuesday,"I'm a bit disappointed in the merely dark brown body and dinky head (hey, it's 20%). I'm not disappointed in the port-like aroma. Subtle undertones of nuanced bourbon (think vanilla, banana, marshmallow, and even coconut) coexist with intense dark fruit qualities. It's a great nose, though it doesn't quite floor me the way I expected. The flavor profile indeed reveals many similarities to port. It opens with incredible tones of fig, raisin, currant, apricot, cherry, plum, and peach. Around the middle is where the bourbon flavors appear. It ends with a powerful (but complex) malt sweetness, some umami, and an also significant alcohol presence. Though the booze is somewhat harsh, it also creates layers of nuance that help compensate for the insane sweetness. Somewhat. The palate is coated with a ton of residual sugar, and that makes it a SLOOOW sipper. Even a tiring one. I have even more qualms about the somewhat thin and firm feel - it's not well suited to the flavor profile. Still, the zesty carbonation IS suited to the aforementioned thin, firm texture, helping to cleanse the palate ever-so-slightly. I really dig many aspects of this, and it's one of the most complex brews I've ever sampled...but I doubt I could even drink half a bottle. It's just way too sweet, boozy, and over the top at the end of the day. I doubt I'd trade for this again, but I'm happy to have finally tried it.  3.73/5: Insert diabeetus reference here",0.7275136995349998,3.5,0.8747

Blanc De Blancs,"Aroma is complex and very, very intense in aroma. Super funky aroma with breadiness, grape must etc. It's quite spectacular. Taste comes off moderate to high sour scale, high acidity, and a little bit boozy. Sweet as well blended with the sour. Not quite as funky in the taste as in the aroma. Feel is quite interesting as the sweet/sour taste you'd expect a cloying syrupiness in the back of your throat but it finishes very clean. Gets high marks for that.  Overall this is quite the exceptional beer, but I think the high ABV and high acidity and sour lean it a tad too extreme and not subtle complex enough.",0.7513345796895683,4.75,0.8717
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Vintage 2002. Aroma: Dank funkyness, sharp funk some cheese and citrus layers. This is going to be sharp and sour! Appearance: Dark gold and long lasting white foam. Flavors: Actually, it is not that sour. It is a very balanced rounded citrus sourness. Also, earthy notes and wood brings a nice complexity. Palate: Relatively high carbonation and full bodied. Could have been more dry. Overall: This beer was top shape and very good. Tried the 2007 vintage directly after which I liked a lot.

T: Watery, lightly acidic blueberry, mild earthy funk, barnyard, and grainy wheat. A lingering medium-light tartness imparts a nice refreshing aspect.   M: Light bodied, crisp, with medium-high spritzy carbonation.   O: Smells exceptional, but the taste is a bit watery with muted brett flavor.

Fort Point Pale Ale,"The beer is a hazy, bright, yellow-gold coloring that is almost opaque, with a frothy, foamy, bright white head that sits low profile and doesn't appear to be going anywhere. Aromas of citrus initially, with a grassy undertone that anchors the nose a bit. Flavors are a citrus blast on the forward tongue, followed by a subtle biscuit backbone that balances well. Lemon and tangerine dance across the palate with every sip, and there is a grassy and peppery blend to keep the sweetness in check. Smooth, mid-bodied, with light, almost effervescence into the aftertaste of citrus sweetness. Slick, clean, slightly dry finish that leaves some citrusy linger behind.

Oude Geuze Vintage,"Ogv 12 375ml on 172207  Pours a clouded amber color with a small, soon disappearing head, which is unusual for 3F's Geuze, which normally stays coated by a fluffy lacing the whole time.  Smells of oak, sweeter blue cheese, stale malts, earthen mushrooms and a wet cellar quality. The typical 3F funk settles also in, together with a nice lemon zest sourness, softer than on their regular Geuze. Leans heavily on the oaken barrel with an intriguing sweet and sour interplay on top.  Has a soft mouthfeel with a pleasant complexity to it, amped up by an effervescent finish, holding the sourness in balance.  Tastes aqueous, almost flat, with some wood bark and muted toffee malts. Turns more wooden during midpalate with an uncompromising lemon tartness during the finish. The beer ends utmost dry, with a lingering lemon zest tartness, revealing mushrooms, mold and cream cheese.   Actually, this appears less balanced than the regular Geuze, especially next to A&G the OGV is just not as complex.

Very robust, rich, and assertive to the nose. Coffee gives off bitter cocoa and slight dried pitted fruit. Just slight hints of fragrant vanilla. Overall very warm and inviting.   Taste: Robust coffee from start to finish. Even the aftertaste remains rich in coffee, leaving a roasty bitterness in the mouth. It's interlaced with semi-sweet chocolate, making it almost dessert-like yet still contributing a slight char and bitterness. There is also hints of smoke and dried cherries, enhancing the complexity. Maybe just trace of vanilla, nothing more.   Mouthfeel: full-bodied, rich, and silky.

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"750mL 2004 ed thanks to ygtbsm94. Pours a clear, very light pink with a scant, white head. Looking like an unblended and certainly not a rich looking as LP Kriek. Aroma of raspberry preserves, bright grapefruit, true Cantillon subtle funk, fresh berry yogurt. Taste is very sour, bitter citrus for balance, lemon yogurt, woody tannins, lots of geuze character more than just raspberry. The base lambic here is center stage. Mouth watering all the way. Lactic sour palate devastation. Super wet mouthfeel. 1/11/2011 8/4/8/5/16=4.1  750mL 2001 ed thanks again to ygtbsm94. Pours a fire amber red with an excellent pink head that is extremely healthy for a sour albeit a little fizzy. Aroma is unreal: so much fresh raspberry, raspberry preserves, and insanely sharp funk. Taste is sharp, ultimate level of lactic acidity, seedy raspberries, rhubarb, sorrel, and starchy earth. Palate is all consuming, zippy, dry, insanely powerful but quick on your body. What a complete devastation of the framboise category. I cannot believe it but Puzzl and others are right- there is some serious aging potential for krieks and framboise.

Peche 'n Brett,"This is exceptional and yet so simple. Fresh peaches, light sour, and a bit of tanginess it drinks intensely smooth and light. 10%? Seems hard to believe as this is smooth and easily drinkable.",0.7534745925725992,4.5,0.5542
Haze,"Unlike lots of DIPAs, Haze did not reek of alcohol nor taste as such. I experienced a delicate balance between 8.2abv and a surprisingly drinkable and dangerous blend of citrus, tropical aroma and welcomed hoppiness.",0.7171199204121642,4.5,0.5386
Green,"In my very humble opinion, the best beer produced by this excellent facility. I have had many of the others, but here is perfection in a glass. Piney, resinous, tropical fruit. A hint of bitterness. A creamy mouthfeel. All in balance, all part of a flavor profile that will haunt you when you have none left.",0.7220548258315982,4.75,0.5002
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"L: Golden honeycomb hues with a thin white head S: Lemons, hay, slight mineral component, and a balanced funk T: Even keeled citrus profile - grapefruit, lime, and lemon pith - complemented by a soft white wine note, oak, and that classic HF-style finish F: Effortlessly soft and crisp mouthfeel O: Another incredible saison from Hill Farmstead. Nicely complex profile with citrus, wine, oak, and a slight funk. Awesome.",0.7219311860829948,4.75,0.4997

Enjoy By IPA,"Taste: complex flowery hops, dank and dry finish. Same with the nose. Amber color, slight haze, with a refined soft foam head and defined ringed lattice. Medium/full body. This was the ""Enjoy By 4/20/17"" version",0.7131619755786459,3.5,0.4939
Nelson,"This rye IPA is a pale gold, effervescent beer that straddles the no-man's-land between hazy and cloudy; a brief-lived, medium pebbly off-white head leaves good, somewhat complex bands of lacing. The nose is moderate in intensity: pineapple juice, pine, sweet florals and more subdued citrus notes with slight alcohol overtones and a hint of body odor. Up front, the palate presents as bitter pineapple, pine/floral soapiness and a nutty bittersweetness. By mid-palate, the citrus character shows a bit, as does the body odor from the nose; the bitterness builds to a medium-strong level, offset a bit by a modest bready malt presence (I don't really pick up any rye character). The finish is balanced and closes out with a decent carbonation bite, followed by the onset of a nice strong resinous hop bitterness that lingers quite awhile. Mouthfeel is big for the medium body, and the texture is slightly creamy and moderately peppery from the fizzy-yet-restrained carbonation. (22 oz bottle, 98 days before best-by)",0.7228570014306956,4.0,0.4939
Society & Solitude #4,Very cloudy straw appearance with white head. Aroma is a significant hoppy citrus that is very appealing. Taste is a bitter hoppy citrus that is a great blend and balance.,0.7122904332458014,4.75,0.4767
Todd The Axe Man,"Look: light golden in color, clear Smell: intense citrus notes in these hops, so much hop character Taste: citrus and crisp pine notes from intense hop bitterness Feel: crisp, just like this intensely hopped IPA needed to be. not too dry though",0.7201545061871371,4.0,0.4588
Haze,Very cloudy straw appearance with white head that disipates quickly. Nice balanced aroma of citrus and hops. Taste is also a very smooth balance of hops and citrus.,0.7172574209072976,4.5,0.4215
Flora,"Flora is clean, crisp, light, and tart, with smooth background tones of wine and oak. Its simple, and in it's simplicity adds meaning to all of its variants.",0.7622485212376837,4.75,0.4019
Vicinity,"Appearance: Arrives cloudy and goldenstraw colored with a frothy but modest head; decent retention and some clumps of lacing hang around  Smell: Tropical fruit elements of pineapple, starfruit, mango and tangerine  Taste: The dankness builds after the tropical fruit flavors emerge; pineapple, mango and starfruit forward, with orange and pithy tones developing, through the middle; crisp and hoppy, after the swallow and into the finish  Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate to high carbonation; juicy and very crisp   Overall: A top notch DIPA with a really crisp finish",0.7296081735188613,4.25,0.3809
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"L- Golden-straw with a massive, off-white head S- smooth backbone of clove and wheat, with rails of light, earthy spice and banana T- banana and breadiness assert themselves, with the clove now taking a backseat F- pleasantly fluffy  Very enjoyable, well-structured Hefeweizen. The flavors are a bit light, but what they lack in intensity, they make up for in balance. I can definitely understand why this is a standard-bearer for the style, and while not particularly outstanding, is certainly not a beer to turn down in the future.",0.7285420548252981,4.0,0.3791
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Vibrant ruby with a soft head settling to a persistent creamy white film and thick collar.  Taste is full of seedy raspberry with a mild, balanced acidity that's woodier and a little funkier than Gambrinus. The soft fluffy body comes across as a bit more delicate than Gambrinus, and a little less sour. The semi-dry finish brings up notes of toasty cracker and a little char, but overall LPF is really expressive of fruit without the added acid that often comes along with it.",0.7261646978471774,4.5,0.3499
Swish,Light orange pour with a small head that quickly fades to a thin ring. Robust aroma. Fruity citrus flavor with lingering pine resin. Moderate bitter bite in the finish. Fresh dank hops with medium body and slightly viscous feeling on the palate. An incredible brew unsurpassed.,0.7167479291820434,4.75,0.2782
Beatification,"A: A contrast of transparency and haze from the yellow, and gold pour. Head retention, and lacing are marginal  S: Funk, acidity, wild, and earthy. Lots to seek out in the brett and oak notes, including some fruit undertones (apple, pineapple, citrus, lemon)   T: Earth(y) wildness; pleasurably tart and funky: apples, lemon, grass, a subtle vinous. Flavors/profiles are extremely well balanced   M: Light fizzy body and carbonation  O: Exquisitely funky and earthy for the palates canvas",0.7110375101011268,4.25,0.1096
Mastermind,"Canned on 10/9/2014. Pours a tangerine hue with a hazy clarity and a quarter inch, loose, white head that dissipates into a soapy slick that coalesces around the edges. Nose expresses citrus, pineapple and rind. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of a subtle piney quality and a slight candied flavor to the fruit. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) with a crisp carbonation and a pleasant acidity. Overall, another top-notch IPA coming out of the Northeast Kingdom. I think I may prefer this one to Heady, but falls a little shy of Julius.",0.7249700614918548,4.75,0.0745
Nectarine Premiere,Hazy orange. Tons of nectarine aroma and flavor. Crisp acidity on finish with some background Brett funk. Base beer comes through well despite huge amount of fruit character. Much more complex and tastier than a dG fruited berliner.,0.7344878820342718,4.75,0.0356
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Bottle. Hazy straw. Extra thick frothy head. Looks just the job. Cereal, spice and yeast aroma. Banana present. The bouquet continues into the taste.

Green,"Appearance: pours a hazy golden color with a 2"" head. Thick lace develops.  Smell: citrus, and some earthy bitterness is detectableby the nose.

Todd The Axe Man,"16oz can dated 9/6/19.  Pours clear gold with a chill haze and a short head. Retention is minimal. Juicy and piney in the nose. Medium bodied with a crisp, tacky mouthfeel. Pine, grapefruit, and bitter citrus on the palate with balancing malt. Finishes fairly bitter, a bit malty, and with plenty of pine.",0.7196921052905978,4.25,-0.4588
Haze,"Appearance: poured a yellowish peach color completely hazy with a bright white foamy head.  Aroma: subtle peach and orange juice. The hops give slight earthy green to the nose. The aromas were a bit more tame than the other Tree House DIPAs I have tried.  Flavor: tasted peach and oranges with hop bite at the finish. It's starts sweet and juicy but finishes with a slight gritty bitterness. But very balanced overall between the malt and hops.  Mouthfeel: medium bodied and smooth. Almost creamy. Quiet similar to those trending milkshake IPA's I have tasted.   Overall: not the best of the Tree House but still world class! It's so balanced, keeps me wanting to take a sip a split second after the other. And I wouldn't have even guessed it was 8.2% ABV!",0.7183436625520285,4.5,-0.7653
Swish,"A: Pours an extremely hazy yellow-orange color with 2 fingers of head that slowly fades down to a thin cap that leaves some good lacing  S: Explodes with citrus and tropical fruitiness. Pineapple, orange, and grapefruit are the highlights. Some dank earthy notes if you really get your nose in there. Not much malt presence behind the fruity assault  T:A bit more balanced but still quite citrus and tropical forward. Starts off with the wave of hoppiness, followed by a hint of bitterness and some earthy maltiness that balances everything out. Finishes with lingering citrus notes  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth  O: Leans extremely heavy on the hops, but really never gets much more than slightly bitter. Definitely one of the juicer DIPAs out there, and right on par with most top-tier New England (D)IPAs",0.7137368173267216,4.75,-0.8334
