Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2008 vintage purchased in Brussels from Bier Tempel.  Had to uncork with a bottle opener, but not due to a lack of pressure—the huge thunk as it opened almost perforated my eardrums.  Looks red, bright and very pleasant. Head foams up at the beginning, but then fizzed itself out so that only a thin ring of fine bubbling remains. Carbonation is gorgeously fine. Looks a great fruit lambic.  Nose is wonderfully and genuinely raspberry fresh. Plenty of tart fruit, a hint of sweetness and lots of genuine lambic acidity to give its basis. The fragrance of the fruit is very true and really lovely.  Taste has that classic Cantillon acidity: raw, cutting and tart, but the sweetness and fragrance of the raspberries gives a truly wonderful counterbalance. Still acidic and with a slightly strained bitterness on the finish, but everything else restrains and leavens it beautifully. Yes. This is a wonderful balance for a fruit lambic. Restrained, truly fragrantly fruity, balanced, but still raw and aggressive.  Yes, lovely. The fruit is just right in this one, and the Cantillon acidity is slightly more restrained. Gorgeous.",4.5,0.7947137041704799,0.9984
Abner,"brew was poured from a refillable 750mL Hill Farmstead bottle, filled at the brewery growler-style, into our Founders snifters. It glows a coppery golden orange, putting up a two finger head of creamy off white bubbles. This shows nice retention, leaving thick honeycombed lacing around our glasses. A definite haze cuts clarity, but no sediment is noted. Carbonation appears to be moderate. The nose is richly citric and resiny of hops, with pale and lightly metallic toast of grain, fresh apricot, pineapple, and nectarine fruitiness, and a floral honeysuckle air blowing across the top of it. With warmth the aromatics really start to flourish, giving enhanced hoppy bite and sweetness of grapefruity, floral, and softly earthy varietals, mineral-laden well water, mud, black pepper booziness, muscat grapes, graham cracker breadiness, fresh mint leaf, blackboard chalk, and fresh peppery vegetals. Our first impression is that the flavoring gives extraordinarily juicy and fruity hops, but with nice balancing bite from the harder water and zing of grain. As we sip, the taste begins with a strong interplay between starkly, but authentically, sweet nectarine, tangerine, and pineapple syrups, and the dominant power of grapefruit rind, hop, and stem. These are met and balanced by a menagerie of raw honey, white grape sweetness, sulfuric mineral, lemon rind, herbal and earthy leafiness, cooling vanillas, lactic creaminess, metallic yeast juiciness, and solidly pale grain. The middle comes to a peak with lemon and grapefruity hops, herbal and spicy malt undertones, ethanol, gravel, mineral water hardness, mango fruitiness, and floral clover sugars. The finish is awash with pale graininess, effectively cutting the hoppy onslaught, along with newspaper inkiness, bright yeastiness, chalk and graphite, shitake meatiness, mango, strawberry, and pineapple fruitiness, and sweet booziness, with more of an herbal hoppiness shining through the ashes of the former grapefruit gods. The aftertaste breathes bitterly of grapefruity rind, seed, and juice, sweetly of nectarine and white sugars, pale grain, ghostly wheat, gravel, distant bubblegum esters, planty sap and resins, bittering moss and musk, light amber maltiness, and sea saltiness. The body is medium to full, and carbonation is medium to high. Each sip gives beautifully soft and creamy slurp, smack, froth, and glug. Finishing pop is nice and long. The mouth is left cooled and wetly coated, with eventually mild tannic astringency across the palate, and moderately robust pucker. The abv is appropriate, and the beer drinks incredibly well.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its flavoring. While the nose gives a strong, balanced, juicy rendition of the liquid to come, the ultimate taste is astonishing from that first sip. The hops remain dripping wet, sweet, and juicy, but take on a curiously strong bitterness of grapefruity rind and citrics. The yeast works its way in giving bitterness, along with that harder well water that is so apparent, but seamlessly inclusive. The feel on the sip gives just about all you could ask for, with frothy brushes of creaminess and enough pucker to wake you up. This is a must have from Hill Farmstead, and well deserved of the reputation it has thus far attained.",4.5,0.7972832617613875,0.998
Atrial Rubicite,"500ml bottle, blend 3 (November, 2013), poured into a Jester King wine glass.   The beer pours a deep raspberry red color, hues of pink and purple with strong garnet tones. The beer itself is quite hazy, opaque with a few noticeable bits of sediment floating in the glass and a nice pink colored head, loose and fizzy that vanishes quickly and leaves no lace or film behind. The aroma is great, lots of fresh, juicy raspberry, tart and tangy, with some musty yeast, light oak, lemon citrus and a bit of other sweetened and ripe fruit. The flavors are spot on, huge amounts of raspberry, strawberry, light oak quality, the sourness is very acetic while the fruit flavors read more tart. There is a good amount of citrus quality as well as the bretty flavor present, but this beer is all about the raspberry. It's simple, but delicate, beautiful and super fresh, the raspberry is showcased extremely well and the balance between the fresh fruit and acetic sour character is wonderful. The mouthfeel is lively, crisp carbonation, lots of bubbles, that coats the mouth well, and finishes with a gentle touch with only a few prickly bubbles as it goes down.  Verdict: A tremendous effort from Jester King and easily one of the most impressive American Wild Ales I've tried to date. It's fresh, vibrant, delicate and bright and very quaffable. The balance is great, not overly sour, not overly sweet, not overly fruit centric, everything is in it's proper place. This can easily rival any of the Belgian lambics that employ raspberry, a must try.",4.5,0.7926594722992751,0.997

Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is fantastic. Zero warming alcohol for 7.5%. Overall this is an insane NEIPA! All around amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; very smooth and refreshing to drink, with the mildly bitter/drying finish, never aggressive. Amazing soft spot on mouthfeel for the style. Extremely juicy, vibrant, and dank/earthy balanced hop complexity; great bready malt backbone, not overly sweet/heavy. A highly amazing offering, and perfect style example. One of the best I have had.",4.5,0.8133884226531414,0.997
Fou' Foune,"750ml, bottled august 2012  A- Ligh orange colour with a bit of haziness. Decent white head, soon recedes but still leaves a ring and some lacing on the sides of the glass  S- Tart acidity upfront. On the background a lively, fresh fruity feel, citric, some other fruity notes that may feel like apricots though i don't know if i would have catched it if i didn't know before. Not super complex as expected but still pleasantly strong and fresh  T- Pretty much what the smell suggested. I expected maybe something more complex but this is still great. Straightforward acidity upfront, tart with a slight spicy/prickly feel. Strong fruity notes, apricots now more easily detectable (it has that tart/sweet combination that is typical of apricots), lemon, maybe peach. Again, actually quite simple but amazingly pleasant, vivid and refreshing  M- Light body, with quite a good dose of carbonation to make it more lively. Prickly on the palate and on the sides of the mouth, more on the juicy side on the tongue, with fruit flavours more vivid there. Finish is pleasantly dry and refreshing, leaves you longing for another sip despite strong tartness  O- As already mentioned, a straightforward fruit lambic, fresh, lively, amazingly drinkable for the style, though maybe not as complex as i expected",4.25,0.8027467774494913,0.9964
Zombie Dust,"Really grateful to FBarber for hooking me up with this highly acclaimed beer via trade. I had it once on tap as a nightcap. Let’s see what it tastes like on a fresh palate. Pours an amber color with an orange hue. light haze and moderate head that displays good retention. It’s not the most special looking beer ever, but the appearance does hint at a solid body. The aroma opens with a delicious burst of citrus and tropical fruit. Notes of tangerine, freshly squeezed orange juice, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, papaya and even a hint of banana. Aromas of caramel malt foresee a solid malt base to come. Amidst all of this, a wonderful pungent layer of herbal aromas, pine, grass and dank, delight the nose. From the start, the taste opens up with earthy hops flavors, piny, resiny and dank. The palate opens dry with a significant yet clean bitterness. Flavors begin to open up, particularly the interplay between malts and hops. A firm bready and caramel malt backbone adds body, roundness and moderate sweetness. A juicy burst of citrus fruit, grapefruit rind, orange pith, and a touch of lemon fills the palate. Also, notes of tropical fruit, pineapple and mango compliment the malts and other hops flavors. Delightfully sublime taste overall, supremely balanced and dynamic. Medium bodied, moderately carbonated and smooth overall. Resiny, bitter and dry finish begs for more sips. I could crush multiple bottles. This beer is a true work of art. Finely crafted and supremely balanced. I don’t buy into all of this nonsense that its time has come and that newer beer trends have surpassed it. This magical elixir is, simply put, a delicious classic that has the ability to stand the test of time and outlast passing fads. Well worth the hype!",5.0,0.7967770546453837,0.9963

Citra,"A - Slightly hazed golden apricot color with a full, smooth, creamy, white head. Great retention leaving a thin whispy layer of lace.  S - Very fruity aroma with mango, pineapple, peach, grapefruit, and hints of passion fruit. There is a pleasant sweet malty backbone with a slight bready aspect. Ripe fruit just dominates though.  T - Reflects the nose with loads of ripe fruit (all the ones indicated above). A slight resin/floral flavor is hidden away in the fruit as well. A kick of bitterness toward the finish but it is balanced nicely with the bready malt and sweet fruit.  M - Medium body with above average carbonation. Fairly lively and zesty feel.  D - Loads of hoppy goodness and fruits make this very drinkable. Alcohol is very well hidden. Maybe a little strong on the bitterness but this was a very fresh bottle.  Notes: Wonderful DIPA. Loads of fruit with a great sweet and bitter contrast. Hops are very much on display. Well crafted and very enjoyable. I was extremely happy and lucky to get a sample.",4.5,0.8019811199525785,0.9958
Citra,"Pours a big, fluffy white head. Brew is cloudy and deep orange, deeply translucent, with gold and amber highlights and hints of red. Head retention is excellent, and lacing is sticky and thick.  Huge citrus and tropical fruit aroma (think: Enjoy By). Ruby red grapefruit and tangerine; apricots; peaches; mangos. Floral with a bit of honey. Subtle biscuity malt in the background. Absolutely superb nose.  Flavor is drier and earthier than the nose. First, a hint of citrus peel; slightly resinous hops. Then, the fruit really kicks in mid-palate: juicier citrus and tropical fruit. Final third of the hop flavors returns a mix of resin, pine, and tropical fruit, with a lasting (but pleasant) citrus peel aftertaste.  Overall flavor is surprisingly balanced and even subtle; it's not over the top, especially when compared to the aroma. Amarillo is more dominant than the Citra, IMO; it's more balanaced overall, and I don't get any dank flavors. Malt backbone is virtually nonexistent as a flavor, yet there's enough there that the hop flavors don't come across as unbalanced.  Nice, medium mouthfeel, perfect and lively in the mouth (not DIPA syrup). Minimum sting, absolutely no alcohol presence. Juicy throughout, but a fairly dry finish. Excellent.  This beer isn't really perfect in many respects, but it's damn close across the board. The only thing that I think couldn't be improved is the appearance; it just looks great. The aroma is fantastic. The taste and mouthfeel are superb, but perhaps imperfect for my particular tastes; they're certainly not flawed in any way.  A very drinkable beer; IMO, a slightly better, less citrus peel on the lasting aftertaste would bump it up yet another notch. Really a fantastic DIPA that you should thank the stars if you can get your hands on it.  Thanks to JayORear for this gift!",4.5,0.79910661120683,0.9957

King Julius,"Pours an entirely clouded pineapple juice colored beer, with a one finger broad, bubbly head.  Smells of ripe oranges, peach pulp, mango and white lemon zest among a sherbet sweetness, resulting entirely from the hops. A kiwi supported dankness compliments the lemon, adding a citraic freshness to the nose. As simple as it is, there are no malts being recognizable on the nose. The fruits develop a fantastic depth by themselves, creating a luscious fruit richness, tied together by crisp lemon.  While the beer drinks very refreshing, due to its juicy hop profile, no carbonation bubbles touch the tongue at all, as a pillowy softness provides a world class silkness from the kickoff till the end. It coates the tongue, while the beers body easily provides enough depth to maintain the taste interesting.  Builds up a nice aqueous smoothness, instantly referring to the wonderfully silk mouthfeel, on which juicy orange, mango and papaya become noteable. Once crisp lime massages the palate, the fruitiness turns riper and more pungent, while getting balanced by gentle toffee malts. Those malts then get swallowed by slightly dank, slightly resinous qualities, adding to the lime's richness. Finishes slightly dry, still outstandingly fruity, with prickly kiwi now adding to the sweeter exotic fruits, creating a wonderful fruit bouquet among its initial, creamy softness.  Not only does it drink beautifully, it also tastes that way. Do yourself the favor of letting this sit and warm up for at least 30 minutes and this unfolds a never imagined plethora of aromas, getting mirrored in its taste. Truly complex, while masterfully executed, this is a dream of an iipa come true. The fruit sorbet quality you get in Tree House's Green is recognizable in this as well, although in an alternated way, depicting a mix of ripe mango, mixed into a smoothie with papaya, orange and lemon pulp. Incredibly rich on the tongue, and than there is that phenomenal mouthfeel as well...  This is perfect.",5.0,0.7958842544520662,0.9953
Abner,"Yields a completely hazed yellow-golden mango pulp color with a fluffy, stable white head.  Smells of a very intriguing hop plethora, with just the lightest note of cakey malts, perfectly complimenting to the orange quality of the hops. Also packs lime zest, wet grass a hint of dried blueberries and fresh fallen leaves.  Has a fantastic smooth, fuller bodied mouthfeel with a lively finish, never loosing any of its softness on the tongue. While turning remarkably dry, especially during the finish, the beer stays in perfect balance throughout, due to light white bread malts.  Shines from the very first moment by its world class mouthfeel, which is incredibly creamy and soft, slowly inviting fruity hops to the palate. Lemon pulp, orange peel and some unripe mango get amped up by a pleasant, adapting onion sharpness and soothing wet grass. Its only indication that this is an 8 abv beer is its doughy malt balance, which gets recognizable by rounding out the hop melange, providing just a hint of sweet maltiness - the beer drinks incredibly easy. Looses its fruitiness during late mid palate, slowly getting replaced by more silkness and an intense, long lasting lemon and leaf dryness, producing a short, earthy ginger peak.   Very impressive double ipa, gaining much of its greatness from the incredibly silk mouthfeel, while its perfectly hop composition does the rest. Awesome how this develops on the palate, turns from fruity to herbal to dry - always soothed by soft malts, very well pronounced and clean.",4.5,0.7990168630302007,0.9944
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"I am very appreciative of Stakem for sharing this 2008 bottled in '10 with Kegatron and me. Enjoyed from a Cantillon tulip to match. My 1000th bottle review  This is exactly what I conjure up in my mind when I think of a raspberry lambic, just outstanding in color and is beautiful sitting in the glass like a gem in its resplendence with a beautiful rosy glow and tight ring after collapsing from 3 fingers, the bead is tiny with light pink lace. The smell is incredible, just so packed with strong fruity and funky odor w/ light floral notes that are still punchy and fresh. The nose is intensely raspberry with kmild hint of sour yeast odor. I love the feel as much as the aroma with huge lactic acidity which seems to enhance the mild sweet tart edges of the fruitiness. There is a pretty dry finish, but semi-sharp with dry/acidic qualities and extremely high carbonation like champagne.  This blitzes the palate and mouth with both fruity sweet taste and very intense sour lactic infused flavor. The acidity intensifies as the beer is held in the mouth but there is enough sweetness in the flavor to balance from the full fruity raspberry enhancement. The taste comes off almost as bitter/spicy from the carbonic acid the high carbonation level provides. There is a puckering, mouth drying quality w/ slight woodiness and extra tart raspberry juiciness as it finishes with some residual berry, but the funk and bacteria sour flavors linger into the dry end. Simply a wonderful fruit lambic, not many out there that are this complex and able to be savored in the way I found this to be. Intense yet drinkable a true classic, one of the best I have ever had.",5.0,0.7951669492330794,0.9942

Abner,"Poured from growler into a hill farmstead tulip. A couldy yellow colour with a really nice head retention and lacing, silky white head.   Aroma is full of citrus floral notes, lemony and some light piny notes, robust florals, peppermint, grapefruit, wildflower honey. So complex and inticing.  Taste is full with balanced hop character, creamy grapefruit, resiny wildflower notes, a touch of floraly lemon sweetness then a growing gradual resiny bitterness. Tons of rich orange citrus. Fantastic balance. Drinkability is crazy with so much depth and balance.  Mouthfeel is really full, gentle carbonation with a full bodied malt creaminess, maintains enough of a full dextrin complexity to balance the hop bitterness impecably. Alcohol is well hidden and such a fruity and hoppy body with a creamy upfront malt.  Lives up the hype as an impecable ipa. It balances itself so well between the strong citrus and floral hop character and a creamy malty body. It's is delicious and complex, fantastic. Certainly an impecable beer with a great complexity and warming beer, impressed by the great balance here and the ridculous quality from start to finish.",5.0,0.8362666328871761,0.9912
Double Galaxy,"750 mL growler poured into a snifter.  Appearance - Very hazy orange body. Light wisps on the surface. Clings a little bit.  Smell - Oh yeah. Buckets of hops. Excellent citrus hop smell but it still manages to have a grainy malt presence. Sweet hoppy nectar.  Taste - Juicy citrus hop. Orange and grapefruit flavors. Nice sweet flavor behind it. Very monotonic, but deliciously so. Grainy malt and the sweetness drops off.  Mouthfeel - Medium body. Medium carbonation. Clean and just a little heavy.  Overall - One hop makes it a bit one-note, but the flavor is excellent. Definitely a top IPA.",4.25,0.7982595781543731,0.9903
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"pours out a murky brownish ruby color, nice half finger head leaves a few bits of lacing. nose reminds me of cherry coke in the best way hahah - has this sweet cherry note and an almost vanilla quality. smells delicious, very fruity and sweet. on palate there is a beautiful and rich dark fruit note up front, reminiscent of cherry and plum, the sweetness of the malts is there as well, toasty nuttyness, caramel and toffee, hints of vanilla again. absolutely no booze but a subtle hit of spice and warmth. mouthfeel is medium+ bodied and has a luscious texture to it, excellent carbonation. overall an absolute masterclass and wonderfully smooth and well rounded beer. quads are usually not my thing but its pretty much impossible not to get excited about this one. cheers!",4.75,0.7981451258740948,0.99
Fou' Foune,"The beer comes in a hazy golden yellow orange color with a big white head.  The aroma is of sweet sweet apricot along with oak, funk, and a balance of tartness and sweetness.  The flavor hits immediately of juicy fresh pure apricot then moves onto a gentle tartness that lingers lightly. There's a malt character that cleans that up and really makes this beer so perfect and balanced. It's a strong lemony sourness and dries of oak on the end.  This beer really stands out as the best sour I've had. It truly has fantastic balance. It's so delicious drinking with the fruit being the all star in this beer.",4.75,0.8008207308223143,0.9898

The beer pours a golden color, hazy and cloudy with amber and orange hues and a nice head of soapy white head, a little over a finger tall that has nice retention and yields tremendous swatches of sticky lacing. The aroma is amazing, bright peach fruit, mango puree, orange juice, very tropical with a fragrant bouquet of wildflower and a dank grassiness that brings out some earthy pine as well. The flavors are very nice, but skew to the bitter and earthier side, whereas the nose leads with a bright punch of fruit forward hop expression. There is still an ample amount of tropical character but the beer is roaring with raw and green hop leaf, grassy and dank, assertive citrus rind with a nice spicy and bitter strafe on the tongue such that the malt bill is merely an afterthought relative to any specific flavor. The mouthfeel is great, coating and lively medium body, crisp and bone dry with a hearty finish that offers a touch of boozy warmth.  Verdict: A really delightful IPA from Maine that offers a very fragrant and expressive nose that brings out the bright and delicate nature of the hop blend while the flavors deliver on a beautifully bitter experience that brings a beer brewed at the extremes into an approachable and practical balance.",4.5,0.7991635778276442,0.9893
Focal Banger,"Golden yellow in color with a hazy, unfiltered appearance and lots of floaties. Poured with a moderate, dense, creamy, bright white foam that reduced to a soapy cap. I can smell this from halfway across the room. Intense earthy, resinous citrus hop aromas with mellow floral notes. Prominent, medium malt aromas beneath. Medium bodied with soft, medium carbonation. Smooth, delicate, creamy smooth feel up front followed by light prickly warmth to the finish. Medium high earthy, resinous hop flavors up front that transition to sweet malt. Medium, pine hop bitterness through the middle returning to resinsous hop and malt flavors to the end. Finished with light, sweet, bready malt flavors followed by lingering, mellow, pine hop bitterness. Aromas were intense, but not sharp. Feel was fabulous, creamy and warming. The malt presence was surprising and providing a strong aromas and flavor backbone. Hop flavor was like getting shot out of a cannon followed by a pleasant gentle freefall. The flavors were intense out of the gate and slowly tapered to the end. Great balance, feel, aromas and flavors.",4.5,0.8008660920427504,0.9892
King Sue,"Pours a hazy light golden amber, peach coloration with a large, foamy head. Smells of light biscuity malt and bright, juicy tropical/citrus notes of mango, papaya, grapefruit and orange, as well as a light, grassy dankness. Taste is a terrific balance of somewhat sweet, biscuity malts and bright and juicy citrus/tropical hops, the citrus dominating with a distinct orange juice character, backed up by grapefruit and lighter, just slightly acidic, notes of mango and papaya, with just a hint of a certain grassy dankness. Finishes with a medium, slightly acidic, bitterness and some citrus/tropical notes lingering in the aftertaste, as well as a bit more dankness coming through. Soft mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.  A terrific, citrus-forward NEIPA with a distinct OJ character that is very well-rounded, with a great balance of sweetness and bitterness, as well as a nice dankness. While this is great, I also have to say that I don't really feel that it's any more special than any of the other great NEIPAs out there, and actually a little lacking in the mouthfeel department. I also think that this has 100 IBU in the same way that Heady Topper does, meaning not at all, actually. It's still more bitter than many of its brethren though, which is quite nice indeed.",4.25,0.8060957218724523,0.989
Double Sunshine,"A- Pours a somewhat hazy golden-straw color with a billowing white head of tight bubbles that leaves excellent lacing. Gorgeous!  S- The aroma is heavenly! A rush of tropical fruit and citrus; mango, passion fruit, pineapple, tangerine, lemon, and grapefruit all in large doses!. There is also some peach, pine, dank hops, and some grassy/floral aromas. Just plain delightful!  T- The pine and bitter hop bite up front are more than expected. As it warms more of the tropical fruit bursts onto the scene in a juicy smack to the face! There's a good bit of grapefruit bitterness in the middle/finish. There is a hint of butterscotch/caramel that balances things out. A bit astringent, but still delicious!  M- The mouthfeel is smooth, medium bodied, slightly sticky, and nicely carbonated.  O- Overall this is a wonderful beer, and definitely among the best I've ever had!",4.75,0.7955262988750219,0.9887
Fou' Foune,"From a 750 ml bottle into a tulip.  A-The brew is cloudy and light golden apricot in color. A thin white head drops quickly to patchy cap of foam. A few streams of carbonation are visible.   S-The smell has strong apricot, as you would expect, to go along with the mild, earthy funk. There is a mild sweetness here that balances the sour white grape and vinous acidity. Quite tart.  T-The taste also has heavy doses of apricot. The funk remains mild, and sort of in the background; it works well with the apricot flavor. The sour factor is pretty high here, but there is a lemon-drop type of sweetness that keeps the brew from being a pure mouth-puckerer. The finish is quite long and vinous.  M-The carbonation is fine and more assertive here than in some other Cantillons. That assertive carbonation works well with the tartness of the beer and keeps it lively and crisp-drinking.  O-This is close to my favorite Cantillon and close to my favorite beer. The apricot integrates so well with the standard gueuze/lambic flavors...much better than cherry or raspberry, in my opinion. The result is balanced, complex, bracingly tart, drinkable, and delicious.",4.75,0.7959719721847647,0.9884
Double Citra®,"Canned 1/22/18 Drink by 3/5/18 12 oz.   A Double Dose of Citra hops!!  The pour brings forth a cloudy, dirty golden color liquid with white and amber highlights. A fresh, all white foam covering lasts long, bubbly froth continues full coverage with impressive lacing.  A very classic New England style DIPA nose....mega sweet, tropical fruit, sharp and peppery citrus galore! Sweet piney and spruce tip aroma's with light, grainy and honey sweet malted barley...a bit tangy and earthy, hints of vanilla way down deep.   The flavor is seriously impressive. Thick layers of Citra hop, citrus fruit, tangy herbs, earthy tones, sour apples, oranges, pineapple, soft, lush mouthfeel, light and very clean body. Amazing drinkability, you wanna just crush this can!! It doesnot list the abv. % ....seems seriously well hidden, like Heady Topper and Green. DC might have a slightly better earthy, dry kick in the finish then both of those excellent ipa's. Back to the mouthfeel and body texture....very impressive. Rolls Royce style ride!!!  The easyy, laid-back, crushability is unreal concidering the overall complexity of flavor, aroma and texture. This one is special.",4.75,0.7963506807600854,0.9883
Double Citra®,"Poured from a growler filled at the brewery.  The pour is a cloudy, bright orange color with a 2 finger white head. Great retention and great lacing. Just a beautiful looking beer.   The aroma has lots of citrus to be expected, but also plenty of tropical fruits and some piney hop resin to balance out the sweetness. The caramel malt is very well hidden, but it's there. The aromas here just work so well together it's impossible to stop sniffing the glass.   The taste, like the nose, is a citrus bomb. So much orange peel and juicy grapefruit and tangerine. There's plenty of dank, resinous hop flavor as well to once again balance out the sweetness. The back end is held up by a subtle but pleasant malt bill. Incredible balance.   The feel is medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation. It's creamy, smooth, crisp, and refreshing.   Overall, this is not only my favorite IPA/DIPA, but my favorite beer period. For me, it just does everything perfectly The aroma is intoxicating, and the flavor is complex and extremely well balanced. The only knock on it is that it's relatively light bodied for a DIPA. But this is merely a small blemish on an otherwise flawless beer.",5.0,0.8061573578037942,0.9881
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"4500th review! 330 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 4/20/2014. Pours clear deep ruby red/brownish color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of huge raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apple, light red grape, peppercorn, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, tobacco, light leather, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with awesome complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apple, light red grape, peppercorn, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, tobacco, light leather, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Moderate peppery yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apple, peppercorn, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, tobacco, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible compelxity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from yeast spiciness as well. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy/bready, and lightly crisp/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is amazing. Alcohol is very well hidden with a only a light warmth present after the finish. Overall this is an insane quadrupel style. All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV. Very similar to Abt 12; but this one had more nutty/biscuity malt complexity and a better mouthfeel. A highly amazing offering all around, as I had hoped for.",4.5,0.8032721501997749,0.9877
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2007 vintage  A-pours a bright ruby red color with an extremely light pink colored bubbly head.  S-the nose has a hint of earthy mushroom funk to it, light sweeter oak presence, the fruits are rather bright and the raspberry is seedy and fresh, it has a hint of tartness.  T-the taste is slightly muted in comparison to the nose. the acidity picks up in the finish and detracts from the brightness of the fresh raspberries. the funk is up front and well integrated with a note of oak and earthy flavors. the rapberry in back starts sweet but the acidity really presents a problem for it to push through.  M-medium bodied beer with a slightly syrupy feel to it and high carbonation with a very dry finish.  D-put up against many other lambics and sour raspberry ales, the acidity of some of these, including this one, take away from the juicy fruit flavors you get in the nose. the integration is done very well but this would probably be best drank fresh.  2004 Vintage drank 4/10  A-pours a completely hazed orangish amber color with an egg white head the is creamy and fluffy in appearance  S-the nose is tart and sour up front with notes of acidity, a touch of lactose and funk. Tons of tart raspberries in the back.  T-this is acidic and tart, sour raspberries take over with notes of earthy musk underneath. Hints of vinegar and a light bitterness, tons of tartness at the finish.  M-medium to full body that is smooth on the palate with some light bitterness.

Double Sunshine,"Double Sunshine by Sean Lawson is amazing. Pouring a bottle into a snifter, the color is a nice nectarine hue. Aromas, so sweet and tropical...juicy!!! First taste, not a bitter IPA at all, but complex and hoppy and fruity. Piney notes, not too resiny. Subsequent sips the beer balances out and I get a touch more bitterness. Mouthfeel is great, not too thin. Overall this beer is fantastic. It is perfectly named. It's juicy and sweet and full of sunshine.",4.75,0.8100538692999406,0.9876
Lou Pepe - Kriek,"Lp kriek '13 vintage  Pours a vibrant ember to lilac color with a fizzy, bubbly head, leaving back a thick film of lacing at the rim of the glass.  Dusty, leather accompanied, funky cherry from the very first smell. Produces a ripe, dark sour cherry impression, while ensuring an intriguing complexity, due to wood bark, dried oak and heated cherry pit among a fermented tartness.  Drinks soft and perfectly balanced, while adding a subtle dryness to the uprising, associated tartness during the finish, exhibiting the beers flavor richness perfectly well.  Amarena sweet cherries among a pleasant, earth coated funkiness, showcasing the fruits ripeness with a sugary peak to them. The beer produces a prominent stone quality among a dusty, pleasantly pungent funkiness. Utmost fruity in the finish, featuring almost overripe, juicy cherries in all its facetts and layers.  A different beast than their regular Kriek, way more complex and fruitier. The sherries establish a fantastic characteristic between lusciously ripe, and already fermented fruits, tied together by a crisp, citraic sour punch.",4.5,0.806276808205578,0.9872
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a dark, vibrant, ruby-tinted brown coloring with a foamy, clingy, bubbly, off-white head. Aromas of rich toffee and date forward, with highlights of molasses, apple, caramel, fig, plum, subtle dark grapes, and earthy overtones. Very rich and layered aromas. Flavors are a richly sweet blend of old world fruit forward, sticky sweet with fig, date, plum, raisins, and followed with notes of apple, caramel, toffee, molasses, and earthy notes, as well as a solid boozy kick, and some subtle earthy notes. Extremely layered and dynamic flavor profiles, rich and earthy throughout, on a chewy, rich body. There is an edge from the carbonation that helps to lighten up this beast of a beer, but only slightly. The aftertaste is a blend of all the rich old world and stone fruits, with a solid booze warmth building. Slow, rich, lingering finish, with notes of molasses, date, and fig loitering on your taste buds. What a tremendous beer!",4.75,0.7937505787008643,0.9871

JJJuliusss,"Another incredible juicy, hazy, pillowy soft New England IPA from this amazing brewery. This one did not disappoint, and actually I would rate this as one of my top three IPAs ever (along with Green and Doubleganger). Canned date 8/1/19 so this was quite fresh. Pours a very hazy, cloudy yellow-orange, nearly opaque color with a little white fluffy head and some spotty lingering lacing. I would have given it higher marks for appearance if there were more lacing present on the glass. Smells absolutely amazing, lots of ripe fruit - grapefruit, pineapple, mango, tangerine, papaya, guava, passionfruit, lemon and a little melon. Also a good hit of floral hops, herbal hops, creamy vanilla, bread and malt. Taste follows the nose, and again there’s a trademark Tree House creaminess, juiciness and amazing blend of hoppiness and sweeter malt backbone. Mouthfeel is very tough to beat, amazingly pillowy-soft, as others have described. Very luscious, sticky on the palate, smooth and perfect amount of carbonation. Truly an awesome beer.",4.5,0.7936622623911308,0.9857
Dinner,"What a pleasant surprise to see this available on draft at Ginger Man, NYC. So nice to luck into a hard to find and highly rated Ale.  Pours a thick and slightly cloudy golden orange color. A neat and tidy layer of frothy and lathery white head retains well and displays lacing. In the nose, a succulent burst of tropical, citrus and stone fruit aromas; orange, grapefruit, mango, peach, apricot, and pineapple. A bready and biscuity malt aroma is hinted at midway. Taste opens with a sweet and fruity marmalade flavor with a lightly resiny and bitter finish. Fruity hops flavors of apricot, mango, grapefruit pulp and orange pith interplay with firm graham cracker and caramel malt backbone. Bitterness develops, displaying hops flavors that are dank, oily and resiny. A gentle touch of alcohol, citrus peel, and zesty spice throughout. Medium to full bodied with a round and soft malt mouthfeel, assertive hops bitterness and flavors. Excellent balance. Soft, smooth and gentle carbonated with a resiny finish. Finish is also dry which aids drinkability. Well worth the hype. This was a stunningly delicious DIPA I could have had more of. One of the best DIPAs I’ve ever had.",5.0,0.8327757751785156,0.9851
Pliny The Elder,"Pours a clear crisp golden hue. Thin sudsy white head dissipates pretty quickly. Some light lacing is left behind.  Aroma is a lovely pungent array of bright fresh pine, orangey citrus, with some floral notes - orange blossom, honeysuckle, and a hint of bright fresh cut lemon grass. While the hops are quite aromatic, there is a balance to this as there is a definite light malt backbone coming through even on the nose.   Taste is follows the nose with notes of citrus - lemon, orange, tangerine and orange rind - along with fresh pine and a bright floral notes. Solid cracker-y malt backbone comes through. Incredibly balanced and restrained while still being flavorful and complex. Mild bitterness on the back end with some more piney notes coming through. The classic west coast profile comes through here but without trying to punch you in the palate.   Feel is light, crisp, and pretty smooth. Does have a slight slick oiliness to it. Moderate carbonation with gentle finish.   Overall, this is a lovely IPA with a well earned reputation. What was perhaps most surprising to me was its incredible balance and deftness. In a market saturated with IPAs that try to one up each other, this beer knows what it is and does it so well. Admittedly I've wanted to this one for some time and it did not disappoint - I hope this is not the last time I have this beer.",4.5,0.7960595284579634,0.9848
Cable Car,"2009 bottle, side-by-side with Toronado 20th.  Pours a clear golden yellow with a big creamy white head that hangs on for a while and leaves good lacing.  Aroma is fairly funky with some barnyard aromas and wet grass but the most dominant aroma is the light fruity sourness. Overall, the aroma is what I'd call bright - lots of light tartness with less earthy funk.  Taste is exceptional, lemon zest up front with bready malts, some fruit, maybe pears and green apples, light vinegar. Fairly funky finish but light so with some lemon. Sublime taste, super complex, more tart than funk.  Light bubbly mouthfeel, very citric and biting. Crisp and wine-like in the finish.  This is a superb American wild - well balanced but still nice and sour. I wouldn't put it in the same class as the T20, but it's still a great beer.",4.0,0.8193515719443382,0.9846
Swish,"Poured out 16 oz can into Teku Glass  Appearance: About a finger of thin bubbly head that quickly dissipated. Beer is an extremely hazy, pretty much opaque light tangerine color; the quintessential ""new-age"" NE DIPA.   Aroma:  Oh boy. Super juicy and pungent peaches + pineapples.  Some orange sweetness in there as well (CITRA) Earthy dankness, very green Very little malt presence (if any!)   Taste: Follows aroma perfectly, peach pineapple juice. Nice zesty bitterness throughout the flavor (again, reminiscent of CITRA). Grassy Dankness on the back (Simcoe). Overall; super hoppy, like drinking a blended hop smoothie, with the hop acidity strongly present.  Feel: Medium body, well carbonated and moderately spritzy on the palate.  Overall: Excellent NE Double IPA, rather reminiscent of Trillium Brewing's hop profiles.",4.75,0.8028999643843002,0.9843
King Julius,"Poured from a can into a snifter. Canned 9/2/2016.  A: Pours a very hazy, light orange color. Orange juice-like appearance. One-inch, foamy, white head with minimal retention. Thin, white lacing throughout.  S: Strong aromas of tropical fruit, citrus, and piney hops. Pineapple, mango, melons, and peach accompanied by grapefruit, orange, and tangerine.  T: Straight juice bomb! Tropical fruit notes of pineapple and melons followed by citrus notes of grapefruit and orange. Fruitiness is well balanced with piney bitter hop character.  F: Medium bodied, juice-like, very smooth, and crisp with good carbonation.  O: Overall, this is hands down the best DIPA I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. Lives up to every bit of the hype. So juicy and fruity, but perfectly balanced with hoppy bitterness. Might move to MA just so I can drink this more often. Wow!

Focal Banger,"Cloudy, gold, with two fingers of thick white foam atop. Beautiful look.  Aroma springs from the can and leaps from the glass to fill the area. Sweet grapefruit, grapefruit pith, mango, orange pith, crisp grain, and some very tasty yeast notes make for a full strength, alluring bouquet.  Full flavored version of all the flavors in aroma, brightly and cleanly explodes in mouth, with pithy bitter winning out over grainy sweet to end the sip. Perfectly balanced blast.  Spritzy carb. could be toned down a bit, but it is viscous, soft, easy drinking, refreshing, clean flavored, and a finish that ls epic.  Best IPA they make, have enjoyed very many and I give it highest recommendation. Get. Some. Now.",4.5,0.7928626457023629,0.9832
Double Citra®,"750ml growler poured into a snifter, generously shared by Colin, Mike and Chris! Review from iPhone notes.  The beer pours a hazy, golden straw color, obviously unfiltered, true to Shaun's style with hues of lemon and orange when struck by the light. A soft, fluffy, white head, only a finger or so high rises from the beer that yields a nice network of soapy lace and maintains good retention throughout. The aroma is soft and delicate with lovely citrus, both tangy grapefruit and sweeter lemon and tangerine, mild pine and light earthy spice with some great tropical notes that really brighten the beer. I can't say it's exceedingly complex, the malt is a bit doughy as are more Hill Farmstead beers, but it's so well refined and expressive. The flavors are spot on, tangy grapefruit, lemongrass, tangerine, mango, pineapple with a bit of earthiness and crisp spice and just a subtle layer of cereal grain cross the tongue. It's bitter, but not overly so, the flavors do the talking, not the bitterness, although the nice, bitter dry bite is certainly at the finish. The mouthfeel is nice, it's juicy and full bodied, coats the mouth well, could possibly do with some more carbonation but it finishes so smoothly with a dry snap that is assertive, but not intrusive.   Verdict: A immaculate expression of Citra hops, and an artful IIPA. Certainly one of, if not the best in Shaun Hill's arsenal of hoppy beers. It's beautifully layered, yet enjoyably simplistic that really showcases what hops, barley water and yeast can do when put together in just right quantities and conditions. A masterclass.",4.75,0.8059138750784007,0.983
Cable Car,"Had at the huge whale-ish tasting at Chris's. Thanks to tai4ji2x for this one, a 1L swingtop growler.  Pours a light fizzy head (yay carbonation) which fades quickly over semi clear golden color.  Nose of a light tart fruity sour, lemony like fruit, other fruits as well, light golden malts and a touch of sweetness.  Taste is semi sweet with golden Belgian like malts, tart fruits, little zest and lemon, bready light funk, touch of fruit like apricot or peach, light toasty caramelized candy sugar like, light sweetness, bitter rind, finish is a little flemmy with a dry bready funk, almost no acidity, light oak and vanilla rounding.  Mouth is medium to lighter bodied, decent carbonation.  Overall great, very drinkable, light tartness, nice dry light bready funk, even has some carbonation.",4.5,0.8071584126291605,0.9826
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"A fruit beer executed to near perfection. With the taste of raspberry locked intact, the supporting ale celebrates the berry's bright flavor, its zesty acidity, and its crisp and refreshing taste in ideal fashion; and does so without backing down either.  Delightfully mauve-pink in color, the lightly carbonated ale carries a vibrant tawny appearance and simply glistens in the glass. The bright acidity of raspberry, rose wine, cork and burlap offers the nose a racy fruit scent that's contrasted by equal parts earth and rusticity.  As the beer hits the tongue, the palate is taken back by the beer's acute acidity that plays out above the modest lingering sweetness of fructose and wafer-thin malt. Slim on hops, the slight malt starch supports the beer's impressive sourness and its delicate brine without much interference in taste. Without being overly vinegar, or of lime, or of barnyard funk or game, the sourness is potent but elegant and refined.  Its light body is both softened with carbonation but is also given a sprite effervescent that springs from the tongue like brut champagne. Acidity strips the thirst from the palate and ushers in a high rate of refreshment and drinkability that outweighs its intense raspberry sourness. With an afterglow of fruit, wheat, cork and white pepper.",4.5,0.8060020304358352,0.981
Haze,"Pours a bright yellow, clouded color with a one finger broad white head.  Smells of a tropical mix of grapefruit, passion fruit and fresh squeezed lime pulp. Offers a tropical sweetness on the nose, without a hint of malts but a plethora of well diversed hops instead.  Has a medium, smooth and soft mouthfeel with a long lasting fruitiness and just a dry note during the aftertaste of the beer.  Tastes of lime pulp, dried oranges and papaya, with a crackery maltiness underneath. Has a light effervescence onwards from its mid palate, together with riper turning fruits. Finishes calm, well nuanced on the still fruity hops, which add a little bit of sweetness, creating a papaya, passion fruit impression.  Very hop forward in a tropical ne ipa way, well nuanced with an astonishing depth, resulting seemingly solely from the hops themselves.",4.25,0.7999016321242306,0.9795
Cable Car,"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip. 2009 vintage. Thanks to Dunt for bringing this out to the whale tasting.  Appearance: This has a nice hazy golden yellow color with a great compressed creamy off-white head.  Smell: The aroma is sour and funky. Lemon rind, peach, apricot, and grapefruit provide the fruity tartness, with a lot of great barnyard funk and hay.  Taste: Light pale malt flavor, and a flood of fruity sour notes. Apricot, peach, lemon zest, and some grapefruit toward the end. Lots of lactic sourness, a bit of oak, and some vinegar create a full sour flavor.  Mouthfeel: This is tart and quite acidic. Medium body with crisp carbonation. Lactic and vingeary.  Overall: The flavor is great and sour throughout, and each flavor note is so robust, I really enjoyed this beer.",4.5,0.8071920316315104,0.9792
Very Green,"Canned on 4/17/18 opened on 4/21/18. "" it's sooooo supple!!"" 8.3 % abv.  The pour proves to show off the now, classic Treehouse look, opaque and thick, straw and honey colored liquid with white-haze highlights. The white foam cap is super duper thick and chunky. Intricate and clumpy white lacing sticks to the glass in multiple locations and continuesbto have a decent foamy covetage at all times.   The hoppy aromatics is about as juicy and fruity as possible ! Dense pineapple>wet grass>honeydew melon>cantalope>starfruit and a very light malty balance that has an oats and wheat scent. Some subtle vanilla and mandarin orage pops out later on. Beautifully pungent! An amazing hoppy aromal   Treehouse has a very unique approach, a certain signature with multiple unique aspects that you can always expect, like : thick, opaque, healthy appearance, super super juicy hops and light malt. In my mind this IS what the ""New England Style"" is all about. They set the bar(high) in my mind. Very Green has this thick and heady density to the hoppy flavor that I have not experienced before. Complexity of the dense fruity, tropical hops is simply off the charts. Layer after layer of hop tones just keep mutating and evolving with every gulp. This one showcases the big-juicy, tropical effects of the hops, honeydew melon and cantalope flavor's explode, sweet citrus with a hint of vanilla, smoooth, light golden malt has a rich, velvety oats and wheat flavor and mouthfeel. The way Treehouse makes the malt soo light, smooth and tasty is remarkable. The perfect base and balance for the juicy-ass, tropical melon explosion from these choice American and Australian hops. There is a ""sweet n sour"" style aftertaste from the malt that is very cream and wheat based.   Speaking of mouthfeel and texture...this is as crispy, juicy, smooth, velvety and rich as it gets! A simple light malty bite, crisp and then a bit dry, smoooth and velvety, practically full feeling finish. Only the slightest hint of the 8.3% alcohol with earthy, juicy tones that seem to be maximum volume.   Overall, Very Green is a denser, thicker version of Green. Supple but massively complex, deep rivers of hop complexity and the most lush feel you will ever get from a beer. Treehouse is changing tbe consciousness of ""what is"" a beer.",4.75,0.7966160239461444,0.9784
Abner,"The beer looks beautiful. Rich, thick, cream colored head that stays. It's got great retention. The body is a hazy golden yellow. It's looks very enticing.   The smell is a great blend of citrus and floral notes. Stong orange with lighter hints of a floral bouquet and fresh cut grass.   The flavor is a 180. Strong piny hop flavor bordering on a bitterness that almost resembles coffee. It's balanced by citrus and a sugary sweetness. Leaving mainly a burning bitterness on the front of the palate and a tangy stickiness on the back of the palate.  The beer has the perfect mouthfeel of a double IPA. Rich fully body balanced by a noticable amount of sharp carbonation and hoppiness.",4.5,0.8106546154298993,0.9783
Atrial Rubicite,"Blend 4 bottled April 2014; 500ml bottle poured into a teku.  A: After a bit of an intial gush, the beer pours a beautiful dark red/purple/plum color with a foamy dark pink head that sticks around but leaves no lacing. Fairly cloudy; really looks like raspberry pure. S: My whole kitchen smells like fresh, sweet, raspberry puree. Very juicy aroma, subtle tartness present, no real traces of any funk. T: Much more dry than the aroma would lead you to believe. Great depth of fruitiness - pressed raspberries, subtle tartness, grape skin, crushed raspberry seeds, hints of earth/spice. Tartness works very well with the complex raspberry flavor and there is SOME sweetness, but overall very dry. M: Very crisp, highly carbonated (slightly higher than I pefer), bounces off the tongue, fluffy mouth feel. O: Outstandingly refreshing and great complexity of fruit flavor mingled with subtle tartness. This is an easily crushable raspberry bomb without the cloying sweetness.",4.75,0.7952655879074151,0.9778
Double Galaxy,"Drank on-tap at Armsby Abbey, Worcester, MA Served in a snifter  The beer poured a super cloudy, peach color and was topped by a small, flimsy white head. Spiderwebs of lacing coated the glass.  The aroma was amazingly fruity and pungent. Tons of tropical fruits, including mango, papaya and pineapple. Super strong notes of peaches and apricots. Lots of tangerine juice as well. Pure hop nectar in a glass!  Intense peach and apricot notes also appeared in the flavor profile. Dank and resiny with a slightly floral hoppiness. Some honey was apparent, along with a touch of caramel malt sweetness (just enough for balance). Ruby red grapefruit came through on the crisp, slightly dry finish.  The mouthfeel was medium bodied. Smooth, creamy and supple on the palate.  Galaxy Imperial Single Hop IPA is a ridiculously hopped yet super smooth and drinkable double IPA. It is definitely one of the top three versions of the style I have ever sampled and one of my favorite beers overall.",5.0,0.807050782684035,0.9776
Supplication,"Bottle label data: BOTTLE ON 082515  Dark, orange-brown body; very fine carbonation; thick, billowy, white head. Rather faint, malty aroma with that wild, brett-like quality; cherry and blackberry scent. Tart, sour cherry flavor; acidic. Very sharp, earthy bite; fine fizziness; tangy; dry.  Hmm. Overall, a fine, mouth-twisting tang and sourness to this beer. It comes across with a hard, biting crispness but with a decidedly soft and airy mouthfeel. The cherry twang is front and center, and the appearance is dynamite. I can't really say there is much brown ale maltiness left with this other than the color, yet the overall taste (considering its a wild ale) still is outstanding. Well, this is an awesome beer in all it's quirky, awesome glory...",4.25,0.7998929482183195,0.9775

Haze,Pours a nice hazy medium gold with creamy head. Good retention and nice sticky lacing. Aroma is the usual citrus and dank tropical fruit but with a strong peach accent. Flavor follows. Very delicious with perfect balance and fluffy mouthfeel. No alcohol detected. This is a very drinkable beer for over 8% alcohol. Another winner.,4.5,0.7957515224212102,0.9765
Double Sunshine,"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, yellow-copper coloring with a tall, frothy, big bubbled, bright white head and a steady flow of carbonation throughout the body. Nose of rich, floral hops on the forward nose, with a tangy grapefruit backbone blending with a truckload of resiny character. Layered and inviting nose. Wow! Flavors are smooth and balanced, with a grapefruit tart and sweet blending with a peppery and resiny hops character on the forward tongue. Some roast characteristics toward the end of the palate. The hops characteristics provide both floral aromas and bitter, resiny flavor characteristics. Fantastic. Robust body, but light at the same time. The aftertaste is richly sweet and bitter at the same time, with a heavy fistful of hops resin and citrus tenderizing your palate into a blissful state. Smooth, bitter finish with a slightly drying feel. Fantastic beer!",5.0,0.8110715726838617,0.9753
Focal Banger,"Got in a BIF from Roguer. 16 ounce can into tulip glass, no can dating. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy medium golden yellow color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tangerine, red grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berries, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pepper, pine, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/tropical/fruity/earthy hop and moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, red grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berries, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pepper, pine, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine/grassy/citrus peel/peppery bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, red grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berries, lemon/orange rind, pepper, pine, cracker, biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/fruity/earthy hop and moderate pale malt flavors; with an amazing malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderate dryness from lingering bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, bready/grainy/creamy/sticky, and lightly resinous/rindy mouthfeel that is insane. Perfectly balanced. Zero warming alcohol for 7%. Overall this is an amazing IPA! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/fruity/earthy hop and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and pretty refreshing to drink. Super dank and fairly juicy on hops; just enough malt for bitter balance, with minimal residual sweetness. One of the smoothest IPAs I’ve ever drank. It gets quite resinous/drying through the glass; but still remains very crisp, drinkable, and never astringent. A really delicious and highly impressive offering all around.",4.5,0.8237837296269023,0.9752

Thanks Mutty for the chance to try this one.  2010 Vintage  A-Nice straw yellow pour with nice big white fluffy head into an allagash tulip.  S- Lemon, grass, earth, some slight horse blanket funk but really not too funky. Really crisp smell with a hint of mild sourness. T- Very subdued tartness and super refreshing. Reminded me of a hot day and grabbing a saison or pilsner to quench the thirst but then leads into the slight funk and balanced sourness. Bright citrus fruits and lemon pepper. M- Nice mouthfeel with med-high carbonation and really balanced dry sourness and crispness D- Nice refreshing, light, balanced beer.

Double Citra®,"750ml growler poured into a oversized wine glass. Poured a hazy orangey amber, reminded me of a shandy or radler freshly made. Aroma was slightly citrusy, with a bit of sharp pine hoppy. Not over powering, or underwhelming, nicely balanced. Flavor was hop up front, with the undertones of citrus. Plenty of hop of front, but the citrus kept it from being too much one note. Nice and tingly in the mouth, coated well, and not overly chewy. Overall a great beer. Plenty of hoppy flavor without being a hop bomb, and the citrus flavor worked nicely as well.",4.5,0.8318647022995237,0.9747
Doubleganger,"16oz can, canned 9/22/2017, served in a stemmed glass exactly one week later. Pours a hazy orange-amber body, one and half finger thick, frothy white head, perfect retention and thick rings of lacing. Smell is rich tropical fruit, mango, grapefruit, light sugary caramel, papaya. It's quite bright and appetizing. Flavour is a smooth, rich combination of bright mango, grapefruit, tropical fruits on a light background of light caramel and biscuit. The hop aromatics are very much present on the palate, and it makes for a really nicely rounded juicy double IPA. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, frothy but with a really nice mild zesty bitterness on the backend. Crisp yet slightly hefty and frothy on the finish. Another very good double IPA from New England, one of the better ones for sure, but certainly not the absolute end-all-be-all of IPAs.",4.5,0.7978100412912473,0.9742

Double Galaxy,"Poured from a 12oz can into a tulip glass. Smell is classic Galaxy hops with notes of orange/grapefruit pulp, earthy/floral hops, pineapple and light resiny sweetness (tropical). Taste follows the nose with great creamy body up front. Then, a surge of refreshing orange pulp and earthy hop flavor transitions to the finish. Sweetness is low to moderate with a really nice honey/resin character, and bitterness is fairly low. Carbonation is relatively low as well, just about perfect.  Overall, this is probably my favorite IPA. This beer is absolutely delicious with great complexity and an incredible earthy and citrus hop flavor.

""OH, SO THIS IS HOW A CITRA IPA SHOULD TASTE!!""  pours out a hazed light straw color with a bright white head, some spotty lacing. this one is pretty aromatic and there are flavors of grapefruit, orange, danky herbaceous note, mellow piney character, some significant malty sweetness to provide necessary balance. overall this one looks, smells, and tastes delicious, mouthfeel is on point as well - lightish medium bodied but has some nice fluffy texture to it. very balanced and clean, good amount of juicy and citric character is matched by danky bitterness and sweet malt profile, well done!!",4.5,0.8040518854870409,0.9737
Double Galaxy,"Tap at the Armsby Abbey Hill Farmstead takeover.  Light fizzy 1/2 finger head, soapy lacing, super hazy carrot wheat color.  Nose fresh hops, light musty resin, pine, citrus, very light malt, tangerine, peach etc.  Taste starts grainy and malty, then earthy hops, light floral, then citrus galore, light tropical fruits, tangerine, mango, even slight pineapple, hint of pine and resins, light malty sweetness but little balance. Big malts and bitter hops, would be astringent if it wasn't for the malty sweet balance. finish is fairly bitter, little sweet but dry, hint of fresh pale malt, more hops, long pine and reason, lots of fresh tropical fruit hops late, and gets boozy as it warms.  Mouth med bodied, good carb.  Overall nice, big hops and malts, nice malty balance overall, a bit on the boozy side, decent tropical fruits and citrus hops, overall not too heavy but a sipper.",4.5,0.8029213868481649,0.9735
Abner,"Excited to try this. Expectations high given its reputation. On tap at BeerShop, NYC. Pours a hazy orange color with a thumbnail length frothy head. It is juicy looking and inviting. A medley of tropical, citrus and stone fruit opens the aroma. In addition, there is a touch of dank and herbal aromas evoking resin, floral sweetness and a touch of onion. The malt aroma is bready with a hint of honey and caramel sweetness. Juicy flavors all the way redolent of all kinds of fruit. Notes of pineapple, grapefruit rind, orange peel, tangerine, peach pit, and mango. There is a developing bitterness that adds balance, along with herbal and spicy hops flavors. Notes of floral hops, pine, grass, onion. There is a mild and clean alcohol spice at times. The malt profile, although mostly secondary to the hops dominance, nevertheless has notes of biscuit and honey.  Medium bodied, moderately crisp and a carbonation that is on par. A dry and resiny finish yields a lingering bitterness.  It was a delicious pleasure drinking this one. It was like a hops explosion in the mouth that represented a bouquet of complex flavors. One of the best.",4.75,0.7975738160777681,0.9729

Smell is daaank zesty lemony and orange hops, sweet flower petals, touch of honey, hints of bitter grapefruit and a melange of light tropical fruit, and then some more dank. Pungent.  Taste is big juicy pineapple and lemon zest, sweet at first fading into a more bitter grapefruit hop character, finishes spicy and floral with a touch of pine. Complex and delicious.  Mouthfeel is super rich and thick, almost syrupy, but with healthy carbonation and great drinkability. Perfect.  Damn good.  9.4/10",4.75,0.7932240870696132,0.9728

Doubleganger,"16oz can, 12.6.18, poured into a shaker pint glass.  The beer pours a super turbid and hazy orange color, amber and honey hues with a foamy white head, almost two fingers that has good retention and yields plenty of soapy lace. The aroma is very nice, ultra dank, super green with raw hop oil, tangy orange juice, a bit of mango purée, doughy pale grain and mineral water. The flavors are excellent, loads of juicy citrus, dank green and grassy hops, very floral, tropical fruits offer more fruity and juicy brightness, pale dough and mineral water. The mouthfeel is great, coating and creamy with a nice lively texture and a dry and crisp bite at the finish.   Verdict: A really delicious DIPA from Treehouse. Dank and bright with loads of hop character without being over hopped and green. There is a pleasant raw character that is in this but it melds well with the other flavors.",4.5,0.7946807381646409,0.9724

I like how balanced this one seems. It's sour, but lets the fruit flavor shine and goes down much smoother.",4.5,0.7994057259342755,0.9721
Fou' Foune,"Pours a hazy golden with a lingering frothy white head.  Aroma is lightly funky, slightly sour, vinous, lemony, and doughy. There's an earthy character countering, as well. Floral notes renege.  Flavor is quintessentially sour initially, lactic, with fruity notes of tart lemon, apricot, and strawberries adding complexity. Earthy, slightly barnyard notes form the base and carry into the lightly dry finish. Notes of sweet tart candies surface late, complementing a very light confectioners sugar sweetness.  Body is a touch light, with high carbonation. Very refreshing, with light alcohol warmth.  I hyped this beer up pretty highly, perhaps too much so. While it's a very clean, perfectly sour beer, I expected a little more fruit presence. The fruit comes out a bit more as it warms.",5.0,0.797876594220746,0.9717
Zombie Dust,"Poured into a becher pint glass, the appearance was a muddy orange color with a finger's worth of white foamy head that fell off at a moderate pace. Speckled lace, semi-sticky. The aroma possessed a fine blend of citrusy and piney hops - bold, zesty, spicy and bitter claiming a nice smooth caramel malt base following into a light earthiness. The flavor was fully bittersweet between the citrus, pine, and zesty sort of spicy hop boldness. Malt base tasted nice against the hops. Aftertaste was light and kept to the hops more than expected for an APA. The mouthfeel was between light and medium bodied with a great sessionability about it. Hop harshness isn't distracting - bitterness is there but not controlling. Overall, well done APA, spectacular for a session, a bit hoppier for the style but an honest to goodness all around great beer!",4.0,0.7970202674203894,0.9712
Heady Topper,"Pours a hazy, bright orange coloration with a medium, frothy head. Smell is very hoppy, with quite sweet, juicy and slightly zesty notes of citrus and tropical fruit: grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, papaya, peach; with the merest hint of a certain, dank grassiness and pine. Bit of cat pee there as well. Taste is incredibly hoppy with almost no detectable malt presence at all, just the slightest hint of biscuity malt. Quite sweet, juicy and slightly dank notes of citrus and tropical fruits: grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, papaya, peach that are greatly balanced. There's also a very definitive grassiness to this. I'm not really getting a very resinous character from it, but there is just a hint of pine coming through. Finishes quite bittersweet, with a moderate bitterness that could be considered strong for the style. The Mouthfeel is incredible here, very smooth soft and effervescent, Medium Body and carbonation. So this is the fabled Heady Topper. I can totally see why it's been labeled as the original NEIPA and honestly don't get the controversy that some people like to put on it. This is very sweet and juicy and neither as resinous nor bitter as some people claim, although the bitterness is high for the style. Also, I was quite surprised to not find a single floater in my glass after pouring this into it.",4.5,0.8070623042610965,0.9712
Double Citra®,"On tap. Pours a hazy, glowy orange color. Thin, off white head. Aroma is very tropical. Citra nose through and through. Nose isn't quite as intense as some other top-tier Imperial IPAs but the overall aroma is definitely attractive. The flavor of the hops is a mixture of several tropical fruits and some musty/stemmy hoppiness. Malt is semi-sweet, pale and bready. Citra hops are marvelous. Very drinkable. Not overly bitter. Flavor and aroma are great but a little less potent and pungent than I was expecting. I would still crush this if it was available to me. A long time want; just slightly below my lofty expectations.",4.25,0.7968354282229304,0.971

Solid though the head and color could use a little work.  Notes of citrus, grapefruit, pine and starfruit. A light spritz with a mellow malt body. Moderately aromatic with a decent fruit presence.   Opens grapefruit, pine and starfruit. Juicy and resiny in the middle with a touch of grassiness and pulp. Nice malt body complements a tropical fruit hop bitterness. Aggressively balanced towards the end with just a bit of accented tartness. Aftertaste of more tropical fruit. What a juice bomb!  Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth and quenching in the mouth and crisp and aggressive going down. Dry finish with a filmy, lingering aftertaste. Excellent. Super drinkable and the alcohol is barely there.  Very very good and this one gets better and better as it warms, revealing more aspects of a tasty tropical fruit bouquet. Definitely representative of the top east coast IIPAs.",4.5,0.7959507966128706,0.97
Cable Car,"Popped and poured into Lost Abbey chalices at Toronado. It gushed after popping the cork. It was hazy golden yellow, a healthy amount of foam and good lacing. There is a strong aroma, with plenty of citrus and some nice funk. The taste is fantastic they are notes of citrus, lemon, pineapple, some nice bitterness, some oak, that hoarse blanket goat cheese flavor, the strongest flavor is the tart sourness.

Very Hazy,"16oz. can into Night Shift stemware. Shared by schen9303.   Looks like pulpy orange juice. Nose is citrus, mango, papaya and melon. The brightest and dankest of tropical fruits. Super aromatic and fresh. Beer opens clementine, mango and overripe cantaloupe. Super juicy but not overly sweet. Nice balance of acidity and really soft around the edges. Finishes dry with a lingering orange and slight touch of ruby red. These beers are why Tree House is the best in the style. Body is light with moderate to low carbonation. Soft and fluffy on the palate and goes down crisp and clean with a dry finish. Incredibly drinkable.   Really really good. What impresses me about these beers are not so much the aroma or flavor, but the incredible mouthfeel on them.

Zombie Dust,"Very nice pale ale from a famous brewery that’s new to me. Tried this one on tap at 3 Floyds. Looks great, slightly darker golden-yellow-orange color with a little white head and nice rings of lingering lacing. Very nice aromas - lots of juicy grapefruit, mango, pineapple, tangerine, lemon and passion fruit fruity hops along with some floral and piney hops, nuttiness, caramel, vanilla and malt. Taste follows the nose, and there’s a great balance between the hoppy bitterness and smooth sweeter malt backbone. Good hit of bitter hoppiness at the finish. Smooth, mild, ever so slightly sticky mouthfeel. Good amount of carbonation. Really a great beer - not a 4.5 by any means, but truly very enjoyable.",4.25,0.8003983134771562,0.9686

Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Pours a pitch black coloration with a small, creamy head. Smell is dominated by rich chocolate fudge and an intense cinnamon note, as well as a strong earthy, oaky, peppery rye barrel note and hints of vanilla and chili. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by chocolate fudge, cinnamon and and a subtle but complex rye barrel character of earthy, musty, oaky, peppery notes, as well as lighter notes of roasted malt, vanilla, chili peppers and just a hint of dark fruits. Finishes with a light sweetness and some cinnamon and oaky, spicy notes lingering in the aftertaste. Full, creamy mouthfeel with a rich body and low carbonation.  The cinnamon and chili work really well with the peppery, spicy rye barrel character, although I have to say that the cinnamon presence is way overdone here for my personal taste and that there is also not quite enough of a bitter/roasty counterpoint to the sweeter chocolate and vanilla notes. While mouthfeel is nice and creamy, it's still disappointing compared to Sump as well. Does not live up well to the hype.",4.25,0.7941043506705981,0.967
King Sue,"Pours a bright and sunny yellow with soft orange hues and beautifully hazed.  Bright citrus and tropical fruit notes of grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and orange.  Orange and citrus character comes through much stronger in flavor than aroma, but the tropical fruit is definitely not overpowered and provides a nice complexity.  Medium-bodied, medium carbonation, soft, juicy, and so smooth.  Overall, while PseudoSue alone is a terrific brew, this version takes it to a completely different level. Juicy, a pungent hopping, and goes down easier than most that clock in at 8%, this is just an exception beer.",4.5,0.7926992113219297,0.9664

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2007 Edition, from a 750 ml green bottle, capped and corked. Fizzy pink head on the pour that quickly subsides. Cloudy, somewhat murky deep garnet hue.  Sour, tart and sweet raspberry characteristics in the aroma, some acidity and funk in the background.  Acidic and tart raspberry in the flavour which sweetens up a bit in the middle, with a sour funk on the finish. Some bready malt rises up well into the aftertaste, almost but not quite replacing the acidity.  Medium-bodied, slick and sticky texture, with a moderate amount of carbonation.  Enjoyed this one much more than the Kriek, perhaps the raspberries marry better with the style and blending a bit more based on their inherent nature. Definitely one to pick up if it's available, the fruit does this one justice.",4.0,0.8073600574475317,0.9638
Cable Car,"2010 vintage opened on June 12, 2011. Bottle at Toronado.  Pours a hazy and yellowed amber with a half-finger white cap. Some lacing.  Nice citrus notes – lemon and orange – alongside light white wine vinegar, green apple, and apricot. There’s some funk, but less than I expected, really: soft farmhouse straw-like must alongside a woody and mushroomy brettanomyces bruxellensis funk.  The moderate sourness gives way to a lightly fruity, citrusy tartness. It almost resembles a cider, with its notes of white wine vinegar and lactic acidity, though it is balanced by a good bit of oak and earthy funk. A citrus/quasi-tropical fruitiness (e.g., kumquat) and bready sweetness rounds out the mid-palate.  Medium light in body with medium carbonation. There’s a pleasant dry finish following the lactic acidity. Very drinkable, though I wouldn’t object to a little more acidity, which I’m sure varies according to the vintage. Personally, I wouldn’t give up the farm for this, but wouldn’t pass up a chance to try it.",4.0,0.7950408376772917,0.9636
Dinner,"Appearance - Pours beautiful bright hazy yellow with a dense white head that lasts forever. Lots of sticky lacing all around the glass.  Aroma - Great citrus aroma hits you first followed by some grapefruit and orange peel. There are some underlying floral notes but mostly lots of light citrus.  Taste - The flavors are pretty complex but well balanced. I do not get any one flavor but more everything at once. A mixture of orange peel and citrus, mild bitter grapefruit. I also get some overly ripe melon in the finish.  Feel - Light side of medium soft carbonation, no sign of any alcohol. Smooth and really easy drinking.  Overall - This is such a well crafted IPA, beautiful pour the aroma so smooth and flavorful.",4.75,0.7939802248034624,0.9622
Zombie Dust,"This is a really good, really drinkable, and really hoppy American Pale Ale (which most people would consider an IPA). Pours a light, clear orange gold with a smattering of lacing that persists. Good level of carbonation. Smell is dank, oniony mixed with ripe melon. Hints of cracker and bread malt and yeast aroma as well. Taste is wonderfully hop-forward with great depth of bitterness and flavor from the Citra. I pick up hints of pine and citrus, but mostly ripe tropical fruit in the taste. Malt is there but takes a backseat to the hop show. This is a really nice pale ale and would love to have it more often.",4.5,0.793154190346497,0.9611
Swish,"Pours golden yellow with strong carbonation and a one finger head. Smell is of sticky hop aroma, sweet malts, pineapple and grapefruit citrus. Taste is a citrus wave, with crisp hops, biscuity malts -- with solid bitterness through. Some sweetness stands out as the beer warms up. Still hop forward. Finishes dry and bitter, with a sweet lacing. Overall - really great IPA out of Maine. There's some stiff competition and this beer has to be mentioned when discussing the best.",4.5,0.7939669976321033,0.9601
Atrial Rubicite,Well I must say that the appearance of this beer is impeccable. It pours a bright cherry red which just glows in the glass. Nose is an absolute raspberry bomb. The fruit is fresh and there are even earthy notes of soil in the back. Some perceived tartness towards the finish of the smell. Taste is quite acidic up front creating a nice pucker. Some raspberry sweetness follows and balances well with the sourness. This beer is chick full of bold and big flavors. Mouthfeel is moderate with effervescent carbonation. This is a winner from Jester King!,4.5,0.7961631841880799,0.9589
Focal Banger,"Pours out a very hazy bright yellow.  Aroma is tropical, citrus, floral and piney dank hops.  Taste is orange, mango with pine, earthy dank hops, floral notes and some big citrus notes too. Lots going on!  Medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel and super smooth.  One of the more intense single IPAs on the market! Lots of flavor above and beyond most DIPAs these days, lots of complexity balanced with some decent bitterness and being super crushable! A truly awesome beer!",4.5,0.7961619603471943,0.9586
Double Galaxy,"Thanks to Sean for sharing this one!  Pours a fizzy beige head. Color is a hazed dull golden orange.  Aroma: Mango and grapefruit. Huge fruit profile. Floral, earthy, and fresh. No malts show here. Lots of hops, however.  Taste: Again, mangoes up front providing a sweetness. A light amount of grapefruit citrus. Floral and pine hops. Fresh and earthy. A touch of honey. No malts again.  Mouthfeel: Bitter and smooth. Medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. Ends sticky.  Overall, this was a solid dipa. No malts showing which was awesome. Tons of great hop and fruit flavors. This is up there with the best.",4.5,0.8058790353745291,0.9583

Julius,"Canned 3/21/18  Super hazy 8 SRM, beautiful dense and fluffy slightly off white finger of head that stays  Aroma is delicate with sweet peaches and cream, orange, some pine. Sweet and velvety, no sharp hop notes.  Taste is superb with a light piney and grapefruit hop bitterness up front followed by a moderate intensity orange julius sweetness right in the middle.

T- Melons, peaches, citrus, some blueberries, touch of tropical fruits, earth, nice piney finish. Again this has an amazing balance of flavors.  M- Smooth, light to medium body.

Duck Duck Gooze,"Glowing orange reminiscent of Veritas 007 - beautiful. Light lacing and fizzing head. Outstanding looking beer.  Floral notes, lemon, sour apple, dried apricot, not so ripe grape..  Will vanquish any sour craving, sour apple, lemon/lime tart, refined oaky background.  Light and fizzy mouthfeel - extremely drinkable, although there is an acidity to this that can be overbearing.  I'd like to age this and drink all my bottles now. I wish this was more available - quite delicious.",4.25,0.7981728622038402,0.9542
Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,"Smell: Immediately your hit with huge over ripe pineapple and tropical fruits. Mango, peach, juicy orange, tangerine. Some grapefruit zest and pine. Bubblegum Herbaceous, you also get a slight alcohol presence.  Taste: Right upfront your hit with big overripe tropical fruits pineapple, peach, mango along with this sweet bubblegum flavor. The mid palate the beer turns towards citrus fruit. Orange zest, tangerine peel, grapefruit. Along with some dry crackery malt. In the finish you get more of that citrus zest with some herbaceous notes, spearmint and a low to moderate piney bitterness.  Feel: Medium to full bodied. Semi creamy. Juicy and delicious!  Overall: This is a really explosive beer upfront overripe juicy tropical fruits that transition beautifully in the mid plate to citrus zest with a hint of juiciness. The finish has a perfect amount of bitterness. Only complaint is the spice on the back end but that should go away with a little more time in the fridge. This is a wonderful crafted beer. One of the best single IPA'S out there. A+ 100/100",4.5,0.7954535083326365,0.9534
Double Citra®,"Double Citra  Growler from bring. Thanks, Barry!  As with the other Hill Farmstead IPAs, Double Citra is rather cloudy, amber hued and topped by a lasting bubbly white head.  Pretty awesome aroma. Loads of tropical fruit, papaya and mango in particular, along with a bit of citrusy grapefruit. Little bit of subdued sweetness, a hint of alcohol. Really showcases the citra hop well.  Like the aroma, the palate has a lot of great fruity hop flavor. Peach, pineapple, grapefruit. The malt foundation is solid, but not necessarily sweet. Very slight buttery note that softens the palate a bit. Dry finish with huge biting bitterness that never feels astringent, the signature of HFS DIPAs. Easy to drink, excellent stuff.",4.0,0.7945642725090487,0.9533
Cable Car,"Hazy golden colour with a large fluffy head. Nice lacing.  Intense, funky and tart aroma with a light lemon note. Well balanced.  Sour, lactic, slightly acetic, lemony and slightly astringent. Beautifully balanced and crafted.  Medium body with moderately-high carbonation. Good.  A really good wild ale with a balanced funk character, good tartness and solid flavour.",4.5,0.8382076107965076,0.9525
Double Sunshine,"The beer comes in a hazy dark orange yellow color.  The aroma is hugely hoppy of tropical fruits. Juicy peaches, mango, as well as grapefruit and a bit of pine and earthy herbal and grassiness. Almost a Sunny D juicy or absurdly sweet fruit aroma.  The flavor follows with that tropical fruit and grapefruit citrus note in the front. It goes on and on with juicy tropical, oranges, tangerine, sweet mango, pineapple, passionfruit. Just an onslaught of juicy hops like no other beer. The middle has a light bready honey malt that adds a bit of sweetness. The finish transitions to earthy herbal hoppy and pine notes, fresh and bitter grapefruit peel. A strong bitterness on the finish, but with that ""hop juice"" flavor throughout.  The oats do this beer a wonder with a viscous, medium plus body that flows beautifully under the tongue.  I had it in a blind taste against Abner and Heady Topper, which I thought was my favorite beer of all time. This is now my favorite beer of all time.",5.0,0.7945096587459194,0.9524
Double Galaxy,"750ml swing-top growler poured into my Southern Tier tulip. It poured a pale, yellow orange color that was a little reminiscent of pineapple juice. A thick, frothy, white colored head filled the top two inches of the glass and clung to the sides as I drank it.   The aroma has a juicy, citrusy hoppiness to it with notes of grapefruit, pineapple and mango. Nice range of hoppy flavors coming out in it, and I really liked the tropical fruit notes.   The taste shows more of the juicy, sweeter, tropical fruit notes to it up front. Towards the finish more of a bitter, citrus rind, grapefruit flavor starts to take over and linger into the finish. I get some piny, resiny flavors lingering in the finish as well. Nice range of hoppiness to it.   The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall I thought it was a great beer. It was a very flavorful and easy drinking beer. It had a great range of hoppy flavors to it but more importantly it really managed to balance the juicy, sweet flavors with the bitter, resiny flavors nicely.",4.5,0.8155498099051984,0.9521
Abner,"Pours a hazy golden yellow/orange. Aroma of dank hops and biscuits. Mouthfeel perfect; crisp and refreshing. Taste is piney hops with a wonderful malt backing -- present but not overly cloying. It's certainly not the most bitter or hoppy-tasting DIPA, but its impeccable balance puts Abner up there with the best.",4.75,0.8304488090211314,0.9515
Dinner,Great hazy golden color. Wonderful nose of pineapple and melon. Same flavors on the taste with a balanced bitterness throughout. I think there is also a hint of maltiness. A very pleasant full feel with a pleasant effervescence. Fabulous beer!,4.75,0.8064460469008675,0.9515
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"One of the best Belgian quads out there. I had the opportunity to try it finally. Great color, the smell is rich with malts, not overwhelming on the palate at all.

Duck Duck Gooze,"Really amazing beer...without doubt, one of the best, most drinkable and complex sours I’ve tried (and I’ve had my share). Cloudy honey pour with an amazing amount of carbonation for the style producing a 1/4 inch ivory head that diminishes to a ring. Aroma of peaches, balsamic, citrus rind, and grapes. Flavor doesn’t show the typical ""barnyard"" qualities...instead combining tart, sweet, and fruitiness. Green apple Jolly Ranchers, lemongrass, apricot, and grapefruit...balanced and incredible.",5.0,0.7964749258301796,0.9511
King Sue,"Pour is a semi opaque, light orange hue. Big frothy head, excellent lacing. Candied orange aroma, hints of citrus, pinneapple. Real pungent hop aroma. Taste is big, juicy and resinous. Nice showcase of citra hops. More candied oranges, pinneapple, hints of mango, all with a solid hoppy backbone to compliment it. Not much malt detected, which is a good thing. Mouthfeel is soft and pillowy. Excellent.",4.5,0.801046777036798,0.9501
Supplication,"Bottled 5/11/2015. Poured from a cork and cage into a snifter, the beer is a vibrant, slightly hazed, ruby-tinted brown coloring, with a thin film of off-white head on the surface, and a ton of carbonation flowing throughout the body. Aromas of tart and sour cherries, dark and sweet pinot notes, earthy undertones, hints of currants and berries, and a solid sour component throughout. Flavors are very sour and tart cherry forward, with a solid acidity and richly sweet backbone. That backbone has notes of cherry, chocolate, currants, and toffee, but it is only an accent character, as the tart and sour blend sweeps it up very quickly. Along with the cherry, your taste buds are overrun with tannins, horseblanket, lemon juice, dry and rich pinot characteristics, wood spice and char, tobacco, and an overall sour tone. Very dynamic and layered palate. The body is dry and crisp, with the increased carbonation cleaning up alongside the astringent sourness. The aftertaste is mostly cherry and wood, but with some earthy notes still lingering here and there. The finish is bone dry, with the sour pucker and acidity wringing every last drop of moisture out of your taste buds, leaving them begging for more. What a tremendous beer!",4.75,0.8024974058022162,0.95
Fou' Foune,"Pours a hazy, straw coloration with a tiny, fizzy head. Smell is dominated by sour funk, with some apricot and just a hint of citrus zest coming through as well. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by barnyard funk and hints of apricot and citrus. There's a light estery yeast note and a certain earthy and slightly spicy note to this as well. Finishes very dry and acidic, with only a little sweetness coming through, and another mouth-puckering dose of tartness. Medium body and carbonation. I really didn't feel that this has a very rich, fruity apricot note to it at all, maybe it's the vintage (2017, I believe). The apricot is there, but quite subdued and overshadowed by the strong, funky sourness and citric acidity. This is a very nice lambic without a doubt, but highly overrated in my opinion, as it is neither especially subtle nor complex.",4.0,0.8000723149241606,0.9494

Zombie Dust,Pours a hazy orange with a great fluffy white head. Lot of lacing. Big time citrus aroma! Robust grapefruit and mango notes. Taste is similar to the nose with citrus bitterness but it’s incredibly balanced with caramel sweetness. Don’t Get me wrong it’s a hoppy beer but it’s a nice constant bitter taste mixed with the sweetness. Has a nice crisp mouthfeel medium bodied overall. Just a phenomenal beer.

Zombie Dust,"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, vibrant, golden-copper coloring with a steady flow of carbonation throughout the body, and a foamy, bubbly, low profile, off-white head. Aromas of tart and sweet grapefruit, lemon zest, and orange rind blending with dried grass and piney resinous notes. Flavors are very tartly sweet forward, heavy on citrus, but with some tropical notes here and there, as well. Pineapple and mango highlight the heavy notes of grapefruit and orange rind. All of this atop a bitter green backbone of pine resin, dried grass, and moss. Perfectly balanced, on effervesced, crisp, and dry body. The aftertaste is a solid, balanced blend of the bitter green notes and the citrus medley. Amazingly balanced from beginning to end. The finish is smooth, slightly dry, and effervesced from the carbonation that stays steady flowing the whole time you drink. Amazing beer!",4.75,0.8049621357890118,0.945

A perfect balance of pungent and bitter hops and fruity and refreshing hops, there's layers of pine, grapefruit, some peach, melon and papaya. A little bit of honey and a little bit of weed are also present. The palate opens clean and bitter, resiny, pine-heavy with some grapefruit pith and fruity mango and peach. Malt character is minimal, though a touch of honeyed toast is present. Oily and resiny with a touch of dank weed on the finish with a clean, bruising bitterness, this beer has a truly breathtaking hop expression. Despite the heavy bitterness, this is remarkably drinkable. Excellent.",4.5,0.8008285338715201,0.943

Aroma is citrusy with notes of pineapple, tangerine, orange, and a hint of grapefruit. The citrus aroma is followed by some earthy/dank and pine/resin notes.  Taste is similar to the nose with lots of citrus flavors and finishes with piney and dank flavors. Taste is very hop forward. Malts are somewhat hidden but provide a creamy base. The aftertaste is a nice mix of sweetness and hop bite.  Medium bodied with a smooth and creamy feel. Light carbonation.  Overall an excellent IPA.",4.75,0.8022720906977929,0.9428

Almost has a pulpy, resiny texture to the appearance.  Aroma is a rich, sweet blend of lemon, grape skin, vanilla oak, grass, light funk. Sweeter than expected and not as funky, but very well balanced.  Incredibly easy drinking, initially has a mild funkiness that never turns into an oppresive barnyard funk bomb. Lemon and grass sourness appears mid palate before finishing fruity and sweeter with grapes and vanilla oak.   Lighter side of medium body with soft, fine carbonation. Finish lingers with green apple and lemon.  Well that was nice.",5.0,0.7992217989729988,0.9421

The taste is balanced leaning towards hoppy with firm bitterness. This is what a DIPA should really be. Some reviewers seem to be under the impression this is a NEIPA but it is not.

Flavors are bold and big on the forward tongue, heavy on bitter hops characteristics of pine pitch/resin, dried grass, and pepper spice, followed by a smooth and juicy blend of orange, grapefruit, and a mild tropical fruit blend. Perfectly balanced on a smooth, chewy body.

Low malt presence of a buttery cracker.   Mouthfeel - Low bodied with a good deal of effervescence. Not overwhelmingly tart or astringent but well balanced.

Double Citra®,"Beautiful golden pour, with a thin head (&lt; 1/2 finger), solid retention, and nice fuzzy lacing. Beer is cloudy and opaque.  Aroma is of the most strong and consistent ""cat pee"" odors I have ever gotten from a DIPA. Beyond that, dry hops, citrus, and wheat come through.  The beer is wonderfully sweet and hoppy, and very well balanced - the only malt I get is of grain and wheat. I don't get much in the way of particular citrus or tropical fruit; just an overall sweet hoppiness.  HF avoids the syrup DIPA trap: this beer has a fantastic mouthfeel. It's sweet, hoppy, and balanced, and very drinkable.  This won't go down as my favorite DIPA, but that's really more a factor of the hops chosen rather than the craftsmanship; it's really an exceptional brew.",4.5,0.7979026351627501,0.9371

Tartness and the fruit alike continue over into the taste, but there's more sweetness and blended smoothness than many other sours.

Cable Car,"Poured from the bottle at Toronado in San Diego on 5/26/16. 2009 release.   Appears a vibrant, hazy orange. Aroma is complex with layers of peach, apricot, pear, white grape, lemon, lime... definitely fruit forward tinged with woodsy barrel notes. Flavor is highly complex - this has aged super well. Again there is a melange of stone fruit flavors balanced with tartness and funk and just the right amount of acidity. Very drinkable, yet at the same time it's totally a sipping beer due to the multiple layers of flavor. Smooth and zippy with a pleasing, fine carbonation fully intact.

Citra,"Fresh 22oz. bottle poured into a fluted snifter.  Pours a golden straw color with a thick foamy white head, the head takes its time to settle and lacing clings all over the glass. Ever so slight haze.  The aroma is bright fresh hoppy citrus, noticeable from the bottle before the pour. Grapefruit and orange zest, slight spicy lemon and a faint tropical fruit aroma. The malt is noticeable as well with a bit of caramel sweetness.  Taste is bright citrus hops with a bit of earthy resins. Bitter, but nicely balanced by an ample malt backing.

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2013  2008 vintage poured into Lost Abbey stemware.  A: Dark red with a slight orangish hue and an inch of pinkish beige froth.  S: The aroma displays an absurd amount of jammy, tart, pungent raspberry seed and flesh. It's extremely aromatic and vibrant, with an almost spicy character due to its concentration. There's a lightly sweet crackery malt foundation beneath the fruit. Oak and leather blend with earthy funk. There's a bit of vinegar in there.  T: Sweet and tart raspberry seed and flesh with jammy notes and a subtle malt presence. The fruit is explosive and abnormally expressive. Face meltingly, devastatingly, depressively fruity. Lactic, leathery, and oaky, with a delicious tartness throughout. Vinegar is light in the flavor and there's a pervasive but subtle acetic acidity throughout. Finishes heavy on the fruit with a refreshing tartness and a firm but gentle lactic presence.  M: Upper light to lower medium body with high carbonation. The mouthfeel is sticky, dry, and tannic.  Overall: By far the best bottle of Lou Pepe Framboise I've tried, though I've only had the beer a few times and mostly from older bottles. This was exceptional with a radical funky fruit presence. Highly recommended.",4.75,0.8089914798161473,0.9178
King Sue,"Pours the color and consistency of white grapefruit juice, topped by an inch of white suds. Gobs of yeast escape on the back end of the pour. Tropical aroma evokes pineapple, mango, lemongrass, apricot, and lightly grassy hops.  The taste is crisp and bright, featuring grassy, peppery hops and grapefruit pith against a backdrop of mild, biscuity malt. It's definitely hop-forward, as one would expect, but not cloyingly so. Medium body and carbonation produce a full, lively mouthfeel that synergizes nicely with the hops.  Overall, this is a bright, refreshing NEIPA with no glaring flaws. It is a testament to execution over concept, for what it lacks in complexity, it makes up for with hitting the mark as far as all the essentials are concerned.",4.25,0.8012051325156627,0.9169

Aromas of candied citrus, particularly orange and tangerine. Notes of tropical fruit, pineapple, mango and papaya. Overall, the aroma hints at fruity juicy goodness to come. As expected, a big juicy and fruity taste with notes of bright tropical and citrus fruit. A firm malt backbone is nevertheless a background for dominant hops flavors. Notes of orange cream soda and grapefruit pulp add a citrusy tanginess, while mellow tropical fruit, papaya and mango add a nice counterpoint. There are also hints of passion fruit. Earthy hops flavors add a spicy bite, resiny and redolent of sharp pine needles, as well as a developing bitterness.  Medium bodied and alternating between a crisp and fluffy mouthfeel.

Aroma is fruity, citrusy grapefruit, pale bready malt & spun sugar/cotton candy. Taste is similar to the nose with a perfectly balanced finish that transitions to a pleasant bitterness.

Slightly bitter in a woody branch sort of way. Some peach and mango as well. Orange peel and a slightly oily rind. A touch floral and bitter. Malts are lightly sweet and slightly bready with some raw biscuit dough. A touch of raw honeycomb. Some pineapple as it warms with a touch of grapefruit as well. Surprisingly balanced. Almost crackery snap as well. Almost buttery at times. Slight caramelized sweetness with an herbal push as well.  Mouthfeel: Mediumish body with a moderate carbonation. The typical smooth pseudocreaminess that all Hill Farmstead pale ales possess. Slightly dry on the finish.  Overall: Double down - win one hand.  It's Citra through and through.

Flavor with notes of pine, ruby grapefruit, slightly toasted malts, passion fruit, green resin, spicy and floral hops, a drop of coconut water and tangerine. Dry and bitter aftertaste. Medium velvety body with appropriate carbonation. Alcohol of 8% is very well hidden. Floral, tropical, spicy and resiny DIPA. Intense, but also hoppy balanced with high drinkability.

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2007 vintage opened and served alongside a rich homemade chocolate mousse  A: Medium red body. Slight pinkish hues. Thin, fizzy pink head quickly crashes into a broken collar around the edges. No lacing.  S: Bright raspberries. Nice sweetness with an underlying tartness and sourness that complements it well. Slightly earthy with decent funk.  T: Like the nose, this is all about the raspberries. Not overwhelmingly sweet, but nice and juicy. The sourness and tartness is present but is not puckering... my guests that had never had a true framboise were not bowled over with so much sourness that they couldn't enjoy it! Its got that underlying funk that most cantillon lambics have.  M: Effervescent with assertive carbonation. Medium bodied. Well balanced between sweet and sour/tart.   D: Top notch. The Lou Pepe fruit lambics never fail me.",4.5,0.8016674455349917,0.8475

King Sue,"Pale peach and orange body; hazy; thick and frothy white head with sticky rings of lacing along the glass. Big citrus fruit aroma; pineapple and grapefruit primarily. The taste is made up of bread crust and biscuit malt flavors with some pungent grapefruit notes; mildly tart and zesty with an excellent bitterness edge. Heavy body with a velvety smoothness; dry with a suggestion of alcohol heat; juicy.  By all means this double IPA is eye appealing and exudes some lush citrus aromas.

Double Galaxy,"Growler. Poured like pure fruit juice. Tropicana. Aroma is denser and has less pop than I was expecting. No matter, it still smelled pretty impressive. Galaxy, to me, always has such a ripe, tropical fruity aroma and then the flavor is more assertive. The nose here is mixed citrus with passion fruit. The flavor is more pungent than the nose. A really strong, tropical fruit medley. Passion fruit and some grass. Creamy, full bodied ale.

Aromas of amazing fruit sweetness, juicy and bright, with notes of passion fruit, orange juice, melon, pineapple, and mango. Wow! Flavors are very juicy forward, heavy on orange and mango, with a solid acidity to boot. Solid highlights of pineapple and melon, with subtle grassy hops characteristics. Big bodied, but with a dry, crisp undertone. The aftertaste is all juice, heavy on orange, but with solid tropical characteristics once again. Minimal bitterness, with a subtle acidity building into the slick, dry finish. Very tasty beer. Very juicy.",4.5,0.8106871388746236,0.8269
Double Citra®,"A- Pours a very light golden straw color with orange hues and a medium sized white head that leaves some lacing.   S- The aroma is intensely mandarin orange forward, with lemon zest and grassy floral notes in the background. A good bit of pineapple comes through later in the aroma, and there's some nice biscuity malt as well. Smells glorious!  T- The flavor is more bitter grapefruit forward, and the lemon zest and grassy/floral flavors are more pronounced than in the aroma. The mandarin orange and pineapple are still there, but not nearly as pronounced. This is a week old growler, and they don't use a tube to fill, so this could be why, since I've had a small pour of this before and it had more of these sweeter flavors. The biscuity malt is very prevalent in the finish, which is dry and bitter.  M- The mouthfeel is nearly perfect, medium bodied, buttery smooth, and just the right carbonation.

Warming finish, lightly resinous, with lots of juicy citrus fruits, tangerine, some grapefruit, nips of boosty alcohol, orange, mango, mellow bitter grass and citrus rind.

JJJuliusss,"This is the absolute epitome of citrus juice-bomb IPAs. An almost perfect beer - dark orange light-swallowing in color, a bouquet of fresh, juicy citrus in the aroma, a nice level of carbonation, and an absolute transcendent taste of heavy citrus and some dank earthiness in not quite balance. Best IPA I've ever had.",5.0,0.8033717970129903,0.6037

Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,"L - not sure how this one has eluded me for so long. Pours a thick murk. I'd say yellow, but it's a dark shade of yellow, almost brown. Oily head with a rainbow sheen.  S - fruity peach, pineapple, and apricot. Herbal mango and hop esters. Tart lemon balances an incredible aroma.  T - soft candied orange and tangerine. Subtly spicy with dank hop oils and vibrant passionfruit. Citrus rind a la grapefruit, orange, and lemon-lime, but almost no bitterness, just a mild tingle. Still manages to avoid total sweetness with a touch of dryness and overall herbal undertones. Gentle and balanced.  F - mostly soft and fluffy with a hint of electric zest from the hop acidity. Full without being overly viscous. Low carbonation.  O - one of Trillium's best. Not the juiciest or the most potent, but one of the most balanced. Soft, pithy flavors and focus on extracting as much flavor from the dry hopping as possible.

Tastes of fresh mango, orange and citrus. Crisp and tropical, so smooth and so drinkable - controlled bitterness, faint sweetness. Really stellar. The flavor matches, then exceeds just about any Tree House IPA. Green is an excellent IPA, so no doubt this was exciting before even cracking the can. But Very Green exceeded expectations.",4.75,0.7950831771350135,0.5548

Atrial Rubicite,"Blend one, thanks scotv  The beer pours a dull, bloody red with ruby tones!! some sediment, and a thin white halo of pink head that fades into nothing. The nose is dank and has a funky astringency, vegetable/beet earthiness, followed by a tart, ripe, off-the-vine raspberry fruitiness similar to homage (slightly sun dried tomato-y?). The taste is the same incredible funkiness swept away by tart raspberries. The mouthfeel is quite carbonated, juicy/fruity, tart, with a wheaty medium body, and a lingering dry finish that's cleaner than expected. I think this beer is a potent blend of raspberries and funk, delicious and different. update - Blend four a very different beer - much more fruit forward by comparison",4.25,0.8024610407375544,0.4374

Headroom,"Canned 8/11/17 Pours a turbid pale orange with a finger+ of slightly frothy white head, retention isn't great; this looks like straight up juice. Aroma is very tropical, some citrus, dank. Taste hits the same notes as the aroma, the raw hoppiness is the key note here. As the beer warms I get more distinct fruit notes with grapefruit, pineapple, nectarine, and peach. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, not at all heavy, drinks well given the level of hoppiness and ABV.

Really solid IPA, a sharper and thinner citrusy flavor than Heady Topper, more dankness, but not as much lingering flavor and thickness in mouthfeel.

Haze,"Appearance: poured a yellowish peach color completely hazy with a bright white foamy head.  Aroma: subtle peach and orange juice. The hops give slight earthy green to the nose.
