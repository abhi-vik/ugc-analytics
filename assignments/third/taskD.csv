Green,"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 3/8/2018. Pours opaquely hazy golden orange/amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with awesome retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts.

A highly amazing offering, and perfect style example. One of the best I have had.",0.813388333267598,4.5,0.997
Fou' Foune,"750ml, bottled august 2012  A- Ligh orange colour with a bit of haziness. Decent white head, soon recedes but still leaves a ring and some lacing on the sides of the glass  S- Tart acidity upfront. On the background a lively, fresh fruity feel, citric, some other fruity notes that may feel like apricots though i don't know if i would have catched it if i didn't know before. Not super complex as expected but still pleasantly strong and fresh  T- Pretty much what the smell suggested. I expected maybe something more complex but this is still great. Straightforward acidity upfront, tart with a slight spicy/prickly feel. Strong fruity notes, apricots now more easily detectable (it has that tart/sweet combination that is typical of apricots), lemon, maybe peach. Again, actually quite simple but amazingly pleasant, vivid and refreshing  M- Light body, with quite a good dose of carbonation to make it more lively. Prickly on the palate and on the sides of the mouth, more on the juicy side on the tongue, with fruit flavours more vivid there. Finish is pleasantly dry and refreshing, leaves you longing for another sip despite strong tartness  O- As already mentioned, a straightforward fruit lambic, fresh, lively, amazingly drinkable for the style, though maybe not as complex as i expected",0.8027466699758598,4.25,0.9964
Nelson,"Poured a cloudy golden body with one finger of bubbly white head. Overall impression of appearance is of an excellent IPA, very true to style. Scents of tropical fruit, especially tart passion fruit, a vinous dry white wine character, hints of mango and underlying notes of tart citrus with hints of lemon most noticeable alongside light tangerine and light vegetal hop notes and spicy rye malt. Overall impression of aroma is of a very nice rye IPA that showcases the best of the Nelson Sauvin hops along with the character of the rye. Bright and fruity describes it best. Flavor begins hoppy with notes passion fruit, oniony, vegetal hops, dry white wine, slight citrus peel and some spicy rye malt backbone. Middle continues vegetal flavors with passion fruit fading into the background, spicy rye and spicy hop flavors providing depth, lightly floral flavors and moderate notes of citrus peel. Finish is hoppy and dry with notes of vegetal hops, grapefruit peel, spicy hops and spicy rye malt and some light tangerine. Aftertaste is vegetal hops, grapefruit peel, spicy rye malt and light pine resin. Overall impression of flavor is of an excellent Nelson Sauvin hopled rye IPA, bringing forth the best aspects of both flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a sticky, resinous feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of an excellent IPA, true to form. Overall this is an amazing IPA. It uses two of my favorite ingredients, rye and Nelson Sauvin hops to create a complex and rich IPA.",0.8130119420711583,4.75,0.9963
Zombie Dust,"Really grateful to FBarber for hooking me up with this highly acclaimed beer via trade. I had it once on tap as a nightcap. Let’s see what it tastes like on a fresh palate. Pours an amber color with an orange hue. light haze and moderate head that displays good retention. It’s not the most special looking beer ever, but the appearance does hint at a solid body. The aroma opens with a delicious burst of citrus and tropical fruit. Notes of tangerine, freshly squeezed orange juice, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, papaya and even a hint of banana. Aromas of caramel malt foresee a solid malt base to come. Amidst all of this, a wonderful pungent layer of herbal aromas, pine, grass and dank, delight the nose. From the start, the taste opens up with earthy hops flavors, piny, resiny and dank. The palate opens dry with a significant yet clean bitterness. Flavors begin to open up, particularly the interplay between malts and hops. A firm bready and caramel malt backbone adds body, roundness and moderate sweetness. A juicy burst of citrus fruit, grapefruit rind, orange pith, and a touch of lemon fills the palate. Also, notes of tropical fruit, pineapple and mango compliment the malts and other hops flavors. Delightfully sublime taste overall, supremely balanced and dynamic. Medium bodied, moderately carbonated and smooth overall. Resiny, bitter and dry finish begs for more sips. I could crush multiple bottles. This beer is a true work of art. Finely crafted and supremely balanced. I don’t buy into all of this nonsense that its time has come and that newer beer trends have surpassed it. This magical elixir is, simply put, a delicious classic that has the ability to stand the test of time and outlast passing fads. Well worth the hype!",0.7967771046324729,5.0,0.9963

Taste of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, papaya, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, light honey, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind/herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, papaya, mango, lemon/orange peel, pine, light honey, bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit.

Good amount of dryness from bitterness as well. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, sticky/resinous, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is great.

Citra,"A - Slightly hazed golden apricot color with a full, smooth, creamy, white head. Great retention leaving a thin whispy layer of lace.  S - Very fruity aroma with mango, pineapple, peach, grapefruit, and hints of passion fruit. There is a pleasant sweet malty backbone with a slight bready aspect. Ripe fruit just dominates though.  T - Reflects the nose with loads of ripe fruit (all the ones indicated above). A slight resin/floral flavor is hidden away in the fruit as well. A kick of bitterness toward the finish but it is balanced nicely with the bready malt and sweet fruit.  M - Medium body with above average carbonation. Fairly lively and zesty feel.  D - Loads of hoppy goodness and fruits make this very drinkable. Alcohol is very well hidden. Maybe a little strong on the bitterness but this was a very fresh bottle.  Notes: Wonderful DIPA. Loads of fruit with a great sweet and bitter contrast. Hops are very much on display. Well crafted and very enjoyable. I was extremely happy and lucky to get a sample.",0.8019811199525785,4.5,0.9958
Citra,"Pours a big, fluffy white head. Brew is cloudy and deep orange, deeply translucent, with gold and amber highlights and hints of red. Head retention is excellent, and lacing is sticky and thick.  Huge citrus and tropical fruit aroma (think: Enjoy By). Ruby red grapefruit and tangerine; apricots; peaches; mangos. Floral with a bit of honey. Subtle biscuity malt in the background. Absolutely superb nose.  Flavor is drier and earthier than the nose. First, a hint of citrus peel; slightly resinous hops. Then, the fruit really kicks in mid-palate: juicier citrus and tropical fruit. Final third of the hop flavors returns a mix of resin, pine, and tropical fruit, with a lasting (but pleasant) citrus peel aftertaste.  Overall flavor is surprisingly balanced and even subtle; it's not over the top, especially when compared to the aroma. Amarillo is more dominant than the Citra, IMO; it's more balanaced overall, and I don't get any dank flavors. Malt backbone is virtually nonexistent as a flavor, yet there's enough there that the hop flavors don't come across as unbalanced.  Nice, medium mouthfeel, perfect and lively in the mouth (not DIPA syrup). Minimum sting, absolutely no alcohol presence. Juicy throughout, but a fairly dry finish. Excellent.  This beer isn't really perfect in many respects, but it's damn close across the board. The only thing that I think couldn't be improved is the appearance; it just looks great. The aroma is fantastic. The taste and mouthfeel are superb, but perhaps imperfect for my particular tastes; they're certainly not flawed in any way.  A very drinkable beer; IMO, a slightly better, less citrus peel on the lasting aftertaste would bump it up yet another notch. Really a fantastic DIPA that you should thank the stars if you can get your hands on it.  Thanks to JayORear for this gift!",0.7991065596949245,4.5,0.9957

Saint Lamvinus,"5800th review! 750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 11/14/2016. Listed at 7% on the label. Cork was wet under the cap, and almost fell apart removing it.

Well rounded Brett complexity and solid Lacto presence. Perfectly balanced between grapes, oak, and malts. Was expecting way more out of this.

Nelson,"22 oz. bottle, best by date May 24, 2016 printed on the label. My second beer from Alpine Beer Company, their highly acclaimed Nelson 'golden rye India pale ale'.  Poured into a Duvel tulip snifter.  A - Bright juicy golden yellow pour, appears adequately carbonated with one finger of frothy white foam head that falls quickly and leaves spotty lacing behind. Looks very nice.  S - A beautiful fresh bouquet greets the senses: fresh, juicy, fruity & floral. Fresh earthy pine hop flowers - mango, grapefruit, white grapes, peach. A very fresh & inviting aroma.  T - Flavor follows the nose: fresh, juicy, fruity, & floral. Crisp, earthy, grassy, piney. Fruity with notes of mango & grapefruit, white grape, peaches. Very juicy and fruity, thanks to the Nelson Sauvin hops. Very delicious stuff.  M - The feel is probably the best part of this beer - dangerously drinkable at 7.00% abv, this thing goes down like a 5.00% session IPA. Juicy & fruity. Floral, with perfect balance. The malts keep the hops from ever becoming too bitter.  Overall, an excellent fresh IPA. Very drinkable & refreshing. Highly recommended.

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Look: Pours a light mahogany color with a billowing three finger, khaki head of foam that laces the glass exquisitely.  Aroma: On the nose, sweet milk chocolate, red figs, dates, fresh baked pretzels, soft caramel and some floral notes of yeast akin to banana and clove.  Taste: Docile notes of sugarplums and sweet figs coupled with milk chocolate and gentle caramel. The initial flavors are complemented by a backdrop of clove, vanilla, banana and black pepper on the finish. There is a clean, soothing alcohol profile to it as it warms, and pleasantly, slightly tart notes of tamarind and orange pith emerge as it begins to open up.  Feel: Full bodied and creamy. Not overtly heavy, but rich. Mid-heavy mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation. Very supple and smooth. 11.3% ABV is very well hidden, I've had 8% beers with heavier alcohol profiles.  Overall: Rochefort 10 is a velvety, silky Belgian Quad with rich flavors of candied red, fleshy fruits and milk chocolate with undertones of sweet, peppery, somewhat floral yeast on the finish. Although the flavor is rich, it is never unctuous, unduly sticky or cloying. The mouthfeel is exceptional and absolutely perfect for the style. Worth every penny.

Abrasive Ale,"Poured from a 16oz. can.  A: Pours a hazy golden honey color with a finger and a half of frothy white head. Head retains incredibly well before resting to a thin foamy layer atop the brew. Lacing is beautiful and plentiful.   S: Lots of fruity citrus notes up front. Grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mandarin orange, lemon, sweet bready malts, and pine hop aromas. Also as some slightly noticeable alcohol notes. Overall a well balanced citrus hop forward smell.  T: Fruity and sweet initially with flavors of candied fruits, sweet malts, grapefruit, tangerine, orange peel, lemon zest, pineapple, oatmeal, and caramel. Then you get some pine hop spiciness, pear, onion, alcohol, and herbal flavors. Finishes with more tropical fruit and a nice pleasant bitterness. Very well balanced and pleasant.  M: Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation and a full smooth crisp clean feel. Has a slight alcohol warmth and nice lingering bitterness.   O: A very nice DIPA. The first few times I had this brew I was completely blown away. While it has lost some of its effect on me it is still one of my favorite seasonal brews.

Gueuze 100% Lambic,"2013 variant, somewhat gentle but down the middle pour yields an almost opaque glowing gold beer topped off with a thin ring of bright white head that quickly recedes. Just beautiful. Nose is tart, fruity, and funky. Palate builds upon this with a robust a complex fruity character - getting some lemon, orange, and grapefruit peel. This is definitely a strong funky and sour quality as well, grassy, oaky, dry, farmhouse notes of earth and hay, slight spice to it and a wine like quality. All of the flavors so smooth and perfectly intergrated. Beautifully light and slightly effervescent mouthfeel. Perfect beer.",0.8035516350596064,4.75,0.9926
Todd The Axe Man,"Appearance: Pours a deep golden-orange color with an SRM of 10. A strong white head, that fades pretty quickly. (3.75)  Aroma: Huge aromatic grapefruit, lemon, pineapple, and orange citrus. Even some sweet mandarin orange, and tangerine. . A little pineapple, peach and mango. Don't be fooled. Then comes the mosaic with huge, dank tropical melon and berry. A delicious, rich, sweet, pale-bread maltiness underneath it all. (4.5)  Flavor: The flavors have huge citrus of lemon, orange, grapefruit rind, and pineapple. A touch of peach and mango with some stonefruit marmalade. Again, then strong, dank tropical melon and berry flavors, but not even close to bitter enough to be black tea. Not much pine either. The sweet white bread malts come through for a rather sweet finish. Leans slightly sweet. (4.25)  Feel: Full-bodied, good carbonation. Slightly resinous and oily. Yet, crisp and not creamy. A blueberry flavor lingers on the tongue afterwards, but it's more of a flavor and not all that bitter. (4.25)  Compared with Furious, this one is much lighter colored and clearer. Much stronger citrus and juicy flavor. More sweet orange and pineapple sweetness. Less pine flavor. More of a malt body and is sweeter. Less bitterness, pine and black tea. Leans further east and is more fruity.  Compared with King Sue: This one has a darker orange color. Much stronger berry and dank tropical profile from the mosaic. Its heavier bodied. More oily and crisp. Less creamy. Stronger bitterness.  Overall: Man this is a good IPA. It leans sweeter, and light juice flavors. Tons of fruity and juicy flavor. Really showcases the Citra and Mosaic combo. Tons of fruity flavor like a NEIPA, but it maintains a respectable citrus, dank and pithy fruit flavors of the west-coast, while finishing with the balance of a mid-west IPA. This beer might set the standard for a midwest IPA. (Final Rating: 4.33)",0.8015707510522255,4.5,0.9917

Enjoy By IPA,"Enjoying the Enjoy By 07/04/2016! Actually...enjoy sounds like an understatement. This IPA is fabulous!! Pours a brilliant bronze and orange color. Nice thumbnail foam head. The lacing is ever present and semi sticky. An attractive drink for sure. The aroma covers the spectrum of fruity flavors with a constant undertone of biscuity malt. Mangoe, pineapple and all sorts of tropical goodness hit the nose. Midway, the citrusy tones( I'm thinking grapefruit pith) provide some zest. The resiny hop oils add some pungency. The tropical and citrusy fruit are most noticeable the first half of the drink. Also, the caramel malt backbone is present. Although there is lots of sweetness, the prevalence of hops truly takes over halfway. Citrusy hops, sharp pine needles, resin, herbal aftertaste. Overall, this is a big juicy and hoppy IPA, however, there is some dryness that keeps you wanting more. The body is medium, smooth, the carbonation is soft. So drinkable it's scary! Truly delicious! One of the best! World class!",0.7957111749072099,4.75,0.9911
Abrasive Ale,"Poured from a pint can into a tulip  The aroma is darker than apricot, lighter than copper or amber. A dark golden hazy masterpiece. A decent one-finger head gives way to a persistent skein of froth and faint lacing.  Aromas of mango, pineapple, peach/nectarine, apricot, white plum, white grape, berry, and lemon/lemongrass, with hints of white pepper and clear alcohol. Just a touch of pine/resin. The brew has a nice complex aroma, but it is somewhat subdued. In other words--good, but it would be nice to have more of it.  The aromas were skewed more ""sweet""; the flavors are decidedly more bitter, but not unpleasantly so. Very well balanced, actually. Plenty of malt backbone greets the tip of the tongue, with peach, mango, grapefruit, and pineapple all present. The mid-palate is greeted with more malty sweetness, balanced with grainy/biscuity goodness before transitioning to piney and dank hop notes. The finish features a return of white peppery goodness and a touch a booze. The ABV is very well hidden.   The brew is medium bodied, with excellent carbonation, and never gets sticky, as brews of this ABV can sometimes be. This one almost gets to ""crisp"" level in its finish.  This is an excellent American DIPA. Well-balanced in every way.",0.8130578513793985,4.5,0.9904
Temptation,"A - A bright, golden orange. Nicely carbonated, very clean. Slight lacing along the glass, minimal head that stays.  S - Almost like Champagne, with a nice citrus and tropical aroma. This aroma is quite bright. Not much of a malt smell, but not necessary.  T - That oaky, barrel flavor hits first; it's a nice sweetness of slight vanilla. Then the citrus-orange-tropical flavor strikes the middle of your tongue and joins the oak. I get a slight sour grape/mild green apple there, too, as you go to the finish. The finale is nice and dry. You definitely get a tiny bit of bitterness from the hops, too, which is a surprise.  M - Medium, fizzy mouthfeel. Nothing too strong, though. Light bubbles, again, like champagne. Smooth and bubbly at once.  O - Probably the best-balanced, wild/sour ale I've ever had. It has a wine-ness that's pleasant at first, then a great, light-citrusy beer finishes you off with a fizz. It's very fresh tartness is balanced very well, and the whole beer in the glass is a top-notch experience from pouring to tasting.",0.7945956117486795,5.0,0.9903
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"L -- Pours a fairly hazed bight orange with a dense, white, three-finger head produced with gentle pour. Fabulous, pillowy retention and excellent lacing.  S -- Fruity yeast esters (mostly banana), clove, pepper, nutmeg, pilsner malts, wheat, and a little lemon T -- Taste largely follows the nose. Quite similar to Allagash White, but with a much more pleasant spiciness and overall better flavor balance. Also getting cinnamon, cardamon, and anise F -- Refreshing, quaffable, and flavorful. Well carbonated, but not overly fizzy. Amazingly soft mouthfeel, thanks to the wheat O -- My favorite wheat beer to date, much more flavorful and well-balanced than most. Pretty good value at $12/6-pack  90/100",0.795598121342891,4.5,0.9903
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"pours out a murky brownish ruby color, nice half finger head leaves a few bits of lacing. nose reminds me of cherry coke in the best way hahah - has this sweet cherry note and an almost vanilla quality. smells delicious, very fruity and sweet. on palate there is a beautiful and rich dark fruit note up front, reminiscent of cherry and plum, the sweetness of the malts is there as well, toasty nuttyness, caramel and toffee, hints of vanilla again. absolutely no booze but a subtle hit of spice and warmth. mouthfeel is medium+ bodied and has a luscious texture to it, excellent carbonation. overall an absolute masterclass and wonderfully smooth and well rounded beer. quads are usually not my thing but its pretty much impossible not to get excited about this one. cheers!",0.7981451258740948,4.75,0.99
Fou' Foune,"The beer comes in a hazy golden yellow orange color with a big white head.  The aroma is of sweet sweet apricot along with oak, funk, and a balance of tartness and sweetness.  The flavor hits immediately of juicy fresh pure apricot then moves onto a gentle tartness that lingers lightly. There's a malt character that cleans that up and really makes this beer so perfect and balanced. It's a strong lemony sourness and dries of oak on the end.  This beer really stands out as the best sour I've had. It truly has fantastic balance. It's so delicious drinking with the fruit being the all star in this beer.",0.8008206379549067,4.75,0.9898
Focal Banger,"Golden yellow in color with a hazy, unfiltered appearance and lots of floaties. Poured with a moderate, dense, creamy, bright white foam that reduced to a soapy cap. I can smell this from halfway across the room. Intense earthy, resinous citrus hop aromas with mellow floral notes. Prominent, medium malt aromas beneath. Medium bodied with soft, medium carbonation. Smooth, delicate, creamy smooth feel up front followed by light prickly warmth to the finish. Medium high earthy, resinous hop flavors up front that transition to sweet malt. Medium, pine hop bitterness through the middle returning to resinsous hop and malt flavors to the end. Finished with light, sweet, bready malt flavors followed by lingering, mellow, pine hop bitterness. Aromas were intense, but not sharp. Feel was fabulous, creamy and warming. The malt presence was surprising and providing a strong aromas and flavor backbone. Hop flavor was like getting shot out of a cannon followed by a pleasant gentle freefall. The flavors were intense out of the gate and slowly tapered to the end. Great balance, feel, aromas and flavors.",0.8008660920427504,4.5,0.9892
King Sue,"Pours a hazy light golden amber, peach coloration with a large, foamy head. Smells of light biscuity malt and bright, juicy tropical/citrus notes of mango, papaya, grapefruit and orange, as well as a light, grassy dankness. Taste is a terrific balance of somewhat sweet, biscuity malts and bright and juicy citrus/tropical hops, the citrus dominating with a distinct orange juice character, backed up by grapefruit and lighter, just slightly acidic, notes of mango and papaya, with just a hint of a certain grassy dankness. Finishes with a medium, slightly acidic, bitterness and some citrus/tropical notes lingering in the aftertaste, as well as a bit more dankness coming through. Soft mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.  A terrific, citrus-forward NEIPA with a distinct OJ character that is very well-rounded, with a great balance of sweetness and bitterness, as well as a nice dankness. While this is great, I also have to say that I don't really feel that it's any more special than any of the other great NEIPAs out there, and actually a little lacking in the mouthfeel department. I also think that this has 100 IBU in the same way that Heady Topper does, meaning not at all, actually. It's still more bitter than many of its brethren though, which is quite nice indeed.",0.8060957218724523,4.25,0.989
Fou' Foune,"From a 750 ml bottle into a tulip.  A-The brew is cloudy and light golden apricot in color. A thin white head drops quickly to patchy cap of foam. A few streams of carbonation are visible.   S-The smell has strong apricot, as you would expect, to go along with the mild, earthy funk. There is a mild sweetness here that balances the sour white grape and vinous acidity. Quite tart.  T-The taste also has heavy doses of apricot. The funk remains mild, and sort of in the background; it works well with the apricot flavor. The sour factor is pretty high here, but there is a lemon-drop type of sweetness that keeps the brew from being a pure mouth-puckerer. The finish is quite long and vinous.  M-The carbonation is fine and more assertive here than in some other Cantillons. That assertive carbonation works well with the tartness of the beer and keeps it lively and crisp-drinking.  O-This is close to my favorite Cantillon and close to my favorite beer. The apricot integrates so well with the standard gueuze/lambic flavors...much better than cherry or raspberry, in my opinion. The result is balanced, complex, bracingly tart, drinkable, and delicious.",0.7959719173169328,4.75,0.9884
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"4500th review! 330 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 4/20/2014. Pours clear deep ruby red/brownish color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of huge raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apple, light red grape, peppercorn, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, tobacco, light leather, and yeast/toasted earthiness.

All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV. Very similar to Abt 12; but this one had more nutty/biscuity malt complexity and a better mouthfeel. A highly amazing offering all around, as I had hoped for.",0.8032721501997749,4.5,0.9877
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a dark, vibrant, ruby-tinted brown coloring with a foamy, clingy, bubbly, off-white head. Aromas of rich toffee and date forward, with highlights of molasses, apple, caramel, fig, plum, subtle dark grapes, and earthy overtones. Very rich and layered aromas. Flavors are a richly sweet blend of old world fruit forward, sticky sweet with fig, date, plum, raisins, and followed with notes of apple, caramel, toffee, molasses, and earthy notes, as well as a solid boozy kick, and some subtle earthy notes. Extremely layered and dynamic flavor profiles, rich and earthy throughout, on a chewy, rich body. There is an edge from the carbonation that helps to lighten up this beast of a beer, but only slightly. The aftertaste is a blend of all the rich old world and stone fruits, with a solid booze warmth building. Slow, rich, lingering finish, with notes of molasses, date, and fig loitering on your taste buds. What a tremendous beer!",0.793750530391271,4.75,0.9871

The aroma has a nice crisp tartness to it with hints of sour apples, vinous grapes and lemon. Acidic and woody with a little bit of basement must. Sour and tart with apple sweetness and a nice tart lemon flavor. Woody notes with a nice funky background.   Nice and light on the body with good carbonation. Overall this one is great.

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Exp. Date: 05.01.2022  Frothy, 3 fingers tall, off-white head, not persisting but leaving a small crown. Spare lacing. High malty, bready aroma upfront. Moderate estery notes, mostly raisins - dry fruits in general. High aroma of phenols. Spices,  soft alcohol hint. Seems like perfume, whiskey kind. Plenty of caramel. High malty sweetness. Very bready and rich. Medium-low bitterness. Medium-full body, oily, chewy, soft but very lively carbonation. Pleasent sweetness washed out from palate by medium dry finish.

Pseudo Sue,"High expectations for this well regarded brew. Bought two 16 oz cans, loved the first, reviewing the second. Pours a slightly cloudy yet semi clear straw golden color with visible carbonation. Good retention on the frothy and pillowy soft white head; nice sticky lacing. The aroma greets the nose with a mix of tropical flavors-mango, pineapple, papaya- and citrus-orange zest and lemon peel. Other fruit aromas are also hinted at, including apple and pear. This diverse fruit bouquet is set against a crackery malt background. The broad range of fruit evident in the aroma is reflected in the taste. Juicy flavors of mango, apple, pear and citrus pith, in particular, stand out. However, the dryness of the palate highlights other aspects of the hops and malt. For example, there is a solid crackery and bready malt body that is balanced by a bold peppery, grassy and light pine flavor. Bitterness is on the mild side of moderate. Medium bodied, moderately carbonated, hoppy and yet with a good smooth malt body. I’m loving the clean, crisp and dry finish, and the subdued resiny linger. This has got to be one of the best APAs out there. Definitely lives up to the hype!",0.8219884443574663,4.75,0.9853
Pliny The Elder,"Pours a clear crisp golden hue. Thin sudsy white head dissipates pretty quickly. Some light lacing is left behind.  Aroma is a lovely pungent array of bright fresh pine, orangey citrus, with some floral notes - orange blossom, honeysuckle, and a hint of bright fresh cut lemon grass. While the hops are quite aromatic, there is a balance to this as there is a definite light malt backbone coming through even on the nose.   Taste is follows the nose with notes of citrus - lemon, orange, tangerine and orange rind - along with fresh pine and a bright floral notes. Solid cracker-y malt backbone comes through. Incredibly balanced and restrained while still being flavorful and complex. Mild bitterness on the back end with some more piney notes coming through. The classic west coast profile comes through here but without trying to punch you in the palate.   Feel is light, crisp, and pretty smooth. Does have a slight slick oiliness to it. Moderate carbonation with gentle finish.   Overall, this is a lovely IPA with a well earned reputation. What was perhaps most surprising to me was its incredible balance and deftness. In a market saturated with IPAs that try to one up each other, this beer knows what it is and does it so well. Admittedly I've wanted to this one for some time and it did not disappoint - I hope this is not the last time I have this beer.",0.7960594236619591,4.5,0.9848
Abt 12,"330ml bottle poured into a snifter.  Cloudy dark burgundy brown in color with thick silky light tan head that withstands with good retention before slowly collapsing to an eternal foamy layer on the surface that doesn’t go anywhere until the last sip and leaving fair amount of lacing patch and spot on the glass-side.  Very inviting and enticing aroma of mellow, yet tart and sharp fruity ester with notes of ripe banana, grape, berry, fig, date, prune, and plum. There are also notes of orange peel, candy sugar, molasses, licorice, spicy alcohol, coriander spice, and peppery while malt is also there so upright with its bread, vanilla cream, caramel, and buttery toffee while hop exhibits with some earthy and herbal touch.  The taste is displayed what reflects in the aroma with all those goodness and tasty flavors ranging from mellow, yet tart and sharp fruity ester with notes of ripe banana, grape, berry, fig, date, prune, and plum, as well as orange peel, candy sugar, molasses, licorice, spicy alcohol, coriander spice, and peppery while malt is also there still so upright with its bread, vanilla cream, caramel, and buttery toffee while hop exhibits with some earthy, herbal, and bitter kick in the finish.  Full body with some bold touch through the palate but it is not that too syrupy or sticky with proper amount of body, carbonation is rather low but it is crisp enough to carry all the things well under the smooth mouthfeel. Finish is very pleasantly dry that will quickly lead to the next instant sip.  There are lots of thing going on and changing all along the tasting, from smooth to a bit sharp, from simply tasty to sheer complexity, and from good to truly great.

Todd The Axe Man,"Pours a slightly hazy dark orange. Not pulpy, but it just looks juicy. Head production is strong, and retention is very good.  The nose is an excellent presentation of the hops: green and leafy, slightly vegetal, herbal, and dank, laced throughout with juicy tones of mango, pineapple, orange, grapefruit peel, and flowers. Touches of pepper and oregano. Slight caramel to go along with honeyed biscuit from the malt.  Flavor follows: immediately dank, with juicy and herbal notes following close behind. Juicy hop notes start with orange, before ranging to mango, pineapple, berries, and start fruit. Some chewy malt emerges mid-palate with grainy pale, caramel, and honey tones. Pungent dank tones return in the second half, growing to a peak just shy of overwhelming the brew. It's a classic Mosaic/Citra brew, and the hops really shine.  Very clean and lively on the palate. Semi-dry on the finish, but the hop oils linger for quite a while. Brings the big flavor and feel of a DIPA in a single IPA ABV package.  An excellent brew!",0.7935959342628753,4.5,0.9839
Abt 12,"Pours a deep, dark mahogany coloration with an amber tint and a medium, foamy head. Smells of toasted, dark bready malt, grains and dark fruit. Taste is being dominated by dark, bready, caramel malt, pumpernickel, grains a certain candy sweetness and dark fruits, with a hint of red berries as well: fig, raisins, red/blackcurrant, as well as the merest hint of citrus. Some estery and lightly phenolic notes of banana, clove and spice as well. Finishes quite sweet and spicey, with a strong estery/phenolic note. Thin mouthfeel with a rich body and medium carbonation. While this does have a rich, complex and well-balanced flavour profile, it's just too sweet and phenolic for my personal taste. There's also a strong grainy note to this that almost feels lightly metallic.",0.79813782099778,4.0,0.9834
Gueuze 100% Lambic,"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip. This was bottled in 2012.  Appearance: Pours a quite transparent medium amber/gold and gives a finger or two of head which fizzles away very quickly to a rim around the glass.  Smell: Pleasant floral lemon, citrus rinds, mild peppercorn, grapes. Slight funk as well. Well balanced and very nice.  Taste: Lemon, grassy funk, white grapes, citrus rinds, a nice floral quality. Good amount of sour, but very nicely balanced. Just the right amount of sour in a gueuze for me.   Mouth-feel: Medium carbonation with a medium, dry body. Finish is slightly sour, dry and crisp.  Overall: This is a top notch gueuze. It's strength is it's incredible balance. Very tasty, great aroma and the right level of sour. Definitely a go-to gueuze for all occasions.",0.7988357479501806,4.5,0.9829
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"This is one of the prettiest beers to look at. Big foamy head and beautiful yellow-orange gold color, lots of carbonation. Smells very spicy and fruity, slightly fermented fruit, very sweet. Tastes crisp and also very spicy, cloves, and with some subtle fruitiness that isn't as strong as I think some people make it sound. This is a good thing, as I prefer the wheaty, honey drizzled bready flavors over sweet fruit. Feels super crisp and light, very refreshing and drinkable. Perfect for a warm, sunny day. Overall this is a veritable classic, and certainly deserves its acclaim.",0.8132372472189504,4.25,0.9819
Abrasive Ale,"Pours a hazy golden orange color with a finger of an off-white head.  Aroma definitely shows off the Citra hop. The nice sugary sweetness from the oats and 2-row go perfectly with the Citra characteristics and make it a very juicy aroma. Get pineapple, mango, lots of orange, grapefruit, all being the overly-ripe, juicy variety. Also get a big herbaceous dankness. Awesome.  Taste follows the aroma, which is what I was hoping. Get tons of overly-ripe, juicy fruits. Get mango, some pineapple, good amount of orange marmalade, and grapefruit. Lots of dankness too. Get just a simple sweetness from the light malt to provide an nice canvas for the hops. Bitterness is pretty tame compared to what the title suggests, but you still get a slight pine resin, citrus peel bitterness there. Dries out nicely into that slightly bitter finish. Very light booze taste on the finish too.  Medium body. Outstanding smoothly crisp, creamy mouthfeel. Finishes oily and sticky.  This one gets a lot of hype, but it is well-deserved. Judging by their Todd the Axeman and Abrasive, Surly really knows how to brew with Citra. A wonderfully complex DIPA that stands up there with some of the better ones out there.",0.7951380553002262,4.5,0.9815

Heavy-bodied, low carbonation, silky, chewy, wonderfully balanced.  Overall, while I've always been hesitant when in comes to beers brewed with peppers, this is truly a masterpiece.

Hopslam Ale,"A very impressive, fantastic-tasting double IPA from a great local brewery. Pours a nice amber color with some white fluffy head and some spotty lingering lacing consisting mainly of fine bubbles. Smells of a good mixture of fruity citrus hops, herbal hops and some weaker piney hops. There are also some nice aromas of caramel, vanilla and malt. The taste is outstanding and consists of loads of fruit: grapefruit, lemon, orange, tangerine, mango and passionfruit. There’s also some weaker piney hops, herbal hops, malt, caramel, bread and vanilla. Smooth mild mouthfeel with a little bit of creaminess the coats the palate. Nice carbonation. Outstanding flavors with a great balance between the slightly bitter hoppiness and sweeter malt backbone. Perfect amount of bitterness at the finish. The higher ABV is very well-hidden and this could almost fool you into thinking it was a regular IPA (by alcohol content, not flavor).

Delicious, mouth-watering green apple tartness yet light and refreshing throughout. Outstanding balance of delicate sweetness with a powerhouse punch of sourness. I can't say that my sense of taste is so refined as to differentiate between what the yeast, malt grains, and chardonnay barrel aging all contributed, but I can say that the end product is most pleasing.

Milder piney and earthy hop notes as well.  T: Strong notes of tangerine and grapefruit followed by tropical fruit notes of pineapple, mango, and melons. The oats bring about sweet, caramel, and cracker malt undertones. Ends with piney, earthy, and resinous hops accompanied by a lingering bitterness.  F: Medium bodied, smooth, and crisp with moderate carbonation. Finishes with a slight dryness.  O: Overall, this is a fantastic DIPA. One of my personal favorites for the category and definitely in my top rankings. The fruity/citrus notes of the Citra hops and sweetness from the oats are countered perfectly with the earthy bitterness that comes with the Warrior hops. Very drinkable.

Offers a tropical sweetness on the nose, without a hint of malts but a plethora of well diversed hops instead.  Has a medium, smooth and soft mouthfeel with a long lasting fruitiness and just a dry note during the aftertaste of the beer.  Tastes of lime pulp, dried oranges and papaya, with a crackery maltiness underneath. Has a light effervescence onwards from its mid palate, together with riper turning fruits. Finishes calm, well nuanced on the still fruity hops, which add a little bit of sweetness, creating a papaya, passion fruit impression.  Very hop forward in a tropical ne ipa way, well nuanced with an astonishing depth, resulting seemingly solely from the hops themselves.",0.7999016834793099,4.25,0.9795

Abt 12,"Dark reddish brown color with good cap and lacing.  Complex aroma of clean yeast with floral hops and more than a hint of spice.  Flavor is surprisingly complex. There is an element of dark or roasted malt yet no hint of bitterness, rather a smooth transition between depth of flavor with the lighter elements of sweet bread yeast and indefinable yet present spices. I will say dark fruits such as figs, dates or dark plums but not so much here as I've noticed in other Belgian Quads. I mean they're in there but so well blended together nothing stands out so much as everything melds seamlessly together. Flavors are consistent to the finish and linger just a bit in the aftertaste.  Medium full texture with balancing carbonation.  Ok, it's 10% which makes it whopping strong for a beer. Yet it doesn't seem so, rather a pleasant food accompaniment sort of drink with remarkably fresh vivid flavors that are not so strong as to overwhelm any but the lightest of dishes.",0.794547838206726,4.25,0.9787

Overall, a fine, mouth-twisting tang and sourness to this beer. It comes across with a hard, biting crispness but with a decidedly soft and airy mouthfeel. The cherry twang is front and center, and the appearance is dynamite.

Nelson,"Pours a very light, pale yellow color, with a thin layer of white head. Looks like cloudy apple or grapefruit juice. The smell is very fruity and bright, with citrus & slight mango aromas.  The taste is tart & well balanced with the slightly peppery rye flavor. The hoppiness is very nice, strong but not overpowering. There are notes of tropical fruits, but not much malt. The alcohol is well-masked.  The carbonation is moderate, with mild body. Smooth & well-balanced. This is a delicious IPA. Easy to drink, tart, fruity, bright and very tasty. I highly recommend it & will seek it out again.",0.8355953880116292,4.5,0.9775
Julius,"16oz can poured Into a tulip Canned 10/24/17  A- pours a murky dark orange color with one-finger creamy white head that has good retention after the pour  S- aroma bursts of bright fresh tropical and citrus hops; mango, passionfruit, cantaloupe, orange pith, grapefruit & peach gummy ring candy  T- fresh bright citrus and tropical hops follow the nose with notes of orange pith, mango, passionfruit, grapefruit peel & ripe melon. Mid-palate gives just a trace of sweetness that brings out the flavor of peach gummy ring candy. The finish is juicy and citrusy and lingers dry with a hint of citrus zest  M- medium body with medium carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that continues into a crisp dry finish, super drinkable   O- crushable and juicy, plenty of citrus hops without being too bitter, outstanding",0.7960678116911484,4.75,0.977
Pseudo Sue,"Look: Pours a hazy pale orange color with a massive, foamy head that lingers. Looks like a NEIPA. Aroma: Strong aromas of citrus. Mostly unripened pineapple, peach, and pine. Lemon, mango, & grapefruit are there for support. It's not quite your airy NEIPA because it has a hint of herbs and tropical dankness. Little to no earthiness. It's bitter unripened pineapple in a pine forest. Flavor: The flavor follows those nose. Slightly sweeter, but still the pineapple, peach, lemon and grapefruit. Also some mild herbal quality clove, banana, or onion. A pale malt sweetness follows the citrus for a nice finish. A mild lingering bitterness on the tongue. Body: Medium bodied and well carbonated. Feels light and crisp though. Just enough body and sweetness to satisfy, but incredibly smooth. First it's so light you think it's going to finish like juice, but then has just enough carbonation and malt to create a pillowy and light smoothness that you hardly know it's there.  Compared to Zombie Dust: This is lighter colored and bodied. It has a much more light citrus, pine, and herbal quality. More pine flavor but less bitter. Lighter bodied and more balanced in terms of herbs, citrus, and pine. Really well-rounded.  Overall: A very east-coast style citra-dry hopped pale ale. Delicious. Drinks like juice, but has just enough hop bitterness and body to be so much more. This is the NEIPA before there was a NEIPA. Of the Zombie Dust, Surley X-tra Citra, and this, this one is my choice. The balance and smoothness is unmatchable.",0.7974243497241617,4.75,0.977
Haze,Pours a nice hazy medium gold with creamy head. Good retention and nice sticky lacing. Aroma is the usual citrus and dank tropical fruit but with a strong peach accent. Flavor follows. Very delicious with perfect balance and fluffy mouthfeel. No alcohol detected. This is a very drinkable beer for over 8% alcohol. Another winner.,0.7957515224212102,4.5,0.9765
Gueuze 100% Lambic,"375ml bottle, bottled june 2011  A- Golden yellow, maybe just a bit darker than golden, slightly torbid. a finger of very fine white head disappears in the span of a couple of seconds  S- Great. Strong citric tartness, with lemon in evidence, though notes of apple and grapefruit can be noticed as well. Then some wonderful subtle hints of vinegar and also a slight earthy/barnyard feel. Sweet and rustic  T- Sour of course. Both on the tart/fruity side and on the lactic side. Tartness has dry, pleasantly astringent notes of lemon, apricots, grapefruit, apple and a lively touch of spiciness. Lactic notes bring some balance with an earthy feel and a light funk hint  M- Light bodied, medium carbonation brings a bit of a lively feel. Dry, Sharp and astringent, expecially on the palate. A bit more on the juicy side on the tongue  O- A beer that represents a style a very good one at doing this. Very complex, nice balance and drinkabilty despite strong tartness.

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Served in a Paulaner hefeweizen glass, it pours a hazy, solid yet brilliant orange of a yellow hue. It forms a three-finger foamy and creamy head with seemingly everlasting retention.  A bevy of bubbles can be seen going to the surface from the very bottom of the glass, nurturing the head of the beer.  This beer gives a nice lacing.   Lots of banana, mild bubblegum, wheat malts, very strong biscuit, honey, citrus and clove. Assertive and enticing bouquet.  Excellently rounded and subtle.  Upfront the expressive carbonation is felt, and it accompanies the flavor all throughout.  Perfect balance, the sweet notes and the hoppy bitterness are equally present in that uniform yet complex flavor that the carbonation unveils.  Notes of overripe apple, pineapple, banana, biscuit, wheat malts, hay, honey and clove. The aftertaste is long and slightly sweeter, that crispness dissipates.  Medium to full body, slightly silky and very refreshing.   The subtleties and sophistication of this beer's flavor speak for themselves.  World class beer for sure.",0.7978441230431897,4.75,0.9756
Focal Banger,"Got in a BIF from Roguer. 16 ounce can into tulip glass, no can dating. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy medium golden yellow color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tangerine, red grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berries, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pepper, pine, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/tropical/fruity/earthy hop and moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, red grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berries, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pepper, pine, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine/grassy/citrus peel/peppery bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, red grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berries, lemon/orange rind, pepper, pine, cracker, biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/fruity/earthy hop and moderate pale malt flavors; with an amazing malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderate dryness from lingering bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, bready/grainy/creamy/sticky, and lightly resinous/rindy mouthfeel that is insane. Perfectly balanced. Zero warming alcohol for 7%. Overall this is an amazing IPA! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/fruity/earthy hop and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and pretty refreshing to drink. Super dank and fairly juicy on hops; just enough malt for bitter balance, with minimal residual sweetness. One of the smoothest IPAs I’ve ever drank. It gets quite resinous/drying through the glass; but still remains very crisp, drinkable, and never astringent. A really delicious and highly impressive offering all around.",0.8237837296269023,4.5,0.9752
Pseudo Sue,"Poured from a sixteen ounce can into a tulip...  Considering this brew hales from my home state, I can't believe I've not reviewed it before now.  Pours a beyond-hazy cloudy pineapple-gold with a two finger head (quickly dissipating) with pleasing soapy persistent lacing throughout.  Tropical fruits (pineapple, mango, papaya), musk melon, and floral notes all hit the nose in a pleasing balance. Citra hops, but just a hint, join the fray, countered by a touch of ester. Spice notes (white pepper) too.  The flavor is actually a shade less complex than the nose, but it's still spectacular. A strong sweet malt backbone featuring more tropical fruit and an additional note of citrus (grapefruit). Spicy white pepper notes at the back of the palate. The hops are present, but not overwhelming, showing up as a pleasant floral/grassy flavor.   The mouthfeel is just about perfect. Medium-bodied, but well-carbonated with a smooth crisp finish.   Overall, this is a spectacular brew that nearly straddles the line between APA and IPA, with the overall soapy silky smoothness keeping it in the former category.",0.7946870565627999,4.5,0.9749
King Sue,"having recently drank some of the OH-trillium triangle test beers, my immediate impression in terms of comparison would be ... ""OH, SO THIS IS HOW A CITRA IPA SHOULD TASTE!!""  pours out a hazed light straw color with a bright white head, some spotty lacing. this one is pretty aromatic and there are flavors of grapefruit, orange, danky herbaceous note, mellow piney character, some significant malty sweetness to provide necessary balance. overall this one looks, smells, and tastes delicious, mouthfeel is on point as well - lightish medium bodied but has some nice fluffy texture to it. very balanced and clean, good amount of juicy and citric character is matched by danky bitterness and sweet malt profile, well done!!",0.8040518330784693,4.5,0.9737
Nelson,"derately hazy golden-straw with a white head and visible effervescence. A bit of lacing  S: Big pungent tropical hop notes with some citrus behind them. Guava and passionfruit all the way, with lemongrass and puckering citrus notes of kefir lime and the like. Very balanced malt backbone taking the sideline, with the rye adding a hefty dose of spiciness.   T: More juicy tropical hop notes with very restrained bitterness, and some white wine character upfront. Just enough malt to keep everything in check, with a bit of rye character to boot, but otherwise decently dry. Relatively short finish for an IPA, but very pleasant and with more bright fruit, some bready malt and a little bit of grassiness at the very end.  F: Medium body with pretty moderate carbonation. The carbonation is very tight-knit, giving the beer a fluffy mouthfeel.  Overall: Quality tropical IPA, and very drinkable. The rye is restrained enough not to take the spotlight away from the superb tropical hoppiness.",0.7963401318836436,4.5,0.9735
Todd The Axe Man,"Appearance: translucent bright peach color with no sediment.  Smell: orange citrus and peach. Very fruity and sweet. Just seems a little faded.  Flavor: taste of orange, peach and other notes tropical fruits. Its not as bitter as I expected, just fruity and sweet with some malt. This is far more balance then many IPA's I have tried. The after taste has a nice lingering orange flavor.  Mouthfeel: light to medium bodied, very smooth and clean.  Overall: a winner. I love notes of peach - I could almost swear peaches were added. Must be the Citra hops.",0.8111838699862732,4.25,0.9733
Gueuze 100% Lambic,"Review # 500!!!  Appearance: It has a nice hazy deep golden/orange color to it. It has a nice white head that dies down moderately and leaves little lacing.  Smell: The aromas definitely give out hints of barnyard funk, sour apples, tart notes and lemon zest.   Taste: Like the aromas, it has some yeast funk, tart apples, lemon and a nice sourness. Great combination of flavors.   Mouthfeel: It has a low carbonation with a very nice overall balance and feel.   Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas.",0.8015061481042144,4.75,0.9732
Temptation,Pours straw golden in color with a white head that retains nicely.  Smell has aromas of oak and dry fruity white wine upfront. Aromas of grape must and oak blend nicely with a nice tart lemon aroma at the end.  Beautiful sour lemon flavor is the first to hit the palate and is balanced nicely with a dry Chardonnay and oak finish with a slight straw malt backbone.  Mouthfeel has awesome complexity with dry crisp and sticky characteristics. Lots of bubbly carbonation makes it super drinkable,0.8271254789493864,5.0,0.9732
Enjoy By IPA,First impression: Wow! Tasted from bottle. Pours a clear gold with white head. Huge aroma of citrus floral and pine. Excellent nose. Taste is similar to the nose with robust citrus and floral bitterness mixed with a mild caramel sweetness. It's all about the bitterness here though. Medium bodied with some nice stickiness to the palate. One of the best IPAs I've had. Well done guys!,0.7956343484431883,4.5,0.9725
Fou' Foune,"Pours a hazy golden with a lingering frothy white head.  Aroma is lightly funky, slightly sour, vinous, lemony, and doughy. There's an earthy character countering, as well. Floral notes renege.  Flavor is quintessentially sour initially, lactic, with fruity notes of tart lemon, apricot, and strawberries adding complexity. Earthy, slightly barnyard notes form the base and carry into the lightly dry finish. Notes of sweet tart candies surface late, complementing a very light confectioners sugar sweetness.  Body is a touch light, with high carbonation. Very refreshing, with light alcohol warmth.  I hyped this beer up pretty highly, perhaps too much so. While it's a very clean, perfectly sour beer, I expected a little more fruit presence. The fruit comes out a bit more as it warms.",0.797876594220746,5.0,0.9717
Abt 12,"Appearance: Dark brown in color with a creamy generous tan head that demonstrates very good retention.  Smell: Rich, malty aroma with some semi sweet chocolate.

T- Quality is apparent from the first sip. Nice sweet/bitter balance. Citrus and stone fruit flavors up front, chased by pine and grapefruit peel. A tiny bit of peaty earthiness and some maltiness in the finish.  M- Moderate, resiny feel with no syrupy quality sometimes found. O- Excellent.

Mother Of All Storms,"Split a 22oz into a snifter  A: Pours a clear mahogany color with a finger of off white head that quickly receded to a very thin ring. Minimal carbonation.  S: Lots of dark fruits - figs and raisins and caramel behind with some well integrated bourbon in the background. Not overly sweet though.  T: Similar to aroma, but more toffee and bourbon. I still get a good amount of dark fruit, but well balanced with the toffee and bourbon. Also has a good amount of bitterness to balance perfectly.  M: Medium mouthfeel with low, creamy carbonation.  O: This beer is very well balanced between toffee and dark fruit sweetness and hop bitterness. The bourbon is very well integrated. Probably my favorite Barleywine, definitely more balanced than most of the style.",0.8039253409109242,4.5,0.9714
Heady Topper,"Pours a hazy, bright orange coloration with a medium, frothy head. Smell is very hoppy, with quite sweet, juicy and slightly zesty notes of citrus and tropical fruit: grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, papaya, peach; with the merest hint of a certain, dank grassiness and pine. Bit of cat pee there as well. Taste is incredibly hoppy with almost no detectable malt presence at all, just the slightest hint of biscuity malt. Quite sweet, juicy and slightly dank notes of citrus and tropical fruits: grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, papaya, peach that are greatly balanced. There's also a very definitive grassiness to this. I'm not really getting a very resinous character from it, but there is just a hint of pine coming through. Finishes quite bittersweet, with a moderate bitterness that could be considered strong for the style. The Mouthfeel is incredible here, very smooth soft and effervescent, Medium Body and carbonation. So this is the fabled Heady Topper. I can totally see why it's been labeled as the original NEIPA and honestly don't get the controversy that some people like to put on it. This is very sweet and juicy and neither as resinous nor bitter as some people claim, although the bitterness is high for the style. Also, I was quite surprised to not find a single floater in my glass after pouring this into it.",0.8070623534408964,4.5,0.9712
Zombie Dust,"Poured into a becher pint glass, the appearance was a muddy orange color with a finger's worth of white foamy head that fell off at a moderate pace. Speckled lace, semi-sticky. The aroma possessed a fine blend of citrusy and piney hops - bold, zesty, spicy and bitter claiming a nice smooth caramel malt base following into a light earthiness. The flavor was fully bittersweet between the citrus, pine, and zesty sort of spicy hop boldness. Malt base tasted nice against the hops. Aftertaste was light and kept to the hops more than expected for an APA. The mouthfeel was between light and medium bodied with a great sessionability about it. Hop harshness isn't distracting - bitterness is there but not controlling. Overall, well done APA, spectacular for a session, a bit hoppier for the style but an honest to goodness all around great beer!",0.7970202674203894,4.0,0.9712
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Pours a very deep, dark mahogany, almost black, coloration with a large, foamy head. Smells of bready, caramel malt, toffee and dark fruits, with just a hint of chocolate, licorice and estery spice. Taste is a complex balance of rich, bready, caramel malt, toffee, brown sugar, chocolate, dark fruits: raisin, fig, plum, with lighter notes of chocolate, licorice and just a hint of vanilla and clove. Finishes bittersweet, with a light/medium bitterness and some caramel malt, dark fruits, licorice and clove lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and light/medium carbonation.  Quite a rich and complex Quad that still manages a good balance of sweet and bitter notes, even though leaning a little towards sweet and boozy as it warms. Really not too bad for the style though and there really is an impressive depth of flavor and complexity here.",0.7941067692795791,4.25,0.9708

S- Big fruity tartness (cherry, apple, pear) layered over a nice yeasty funk of hay and must. Also very noticeable merlot and oak aromas.  T- Not as wine-dominant as I expected, the merlot seems to blend very nicely with sour fruit flavors, lots of cherry and grape-skin. Tartness is firm and balanced, has flavors of hay, light funk and wood.  M- Light-bodied, very smooth feel, just the right amount of carbonation, has an extremely dry finish.

Taste follows the nose, and there’s a great balance between the hoppy bitterness and smooth sweeter malt backbone. Good hit of bitter hoppiness at the finish. Smooth, mild, ever so slightly sticky mouthfeel. Good amount of carbonation. Really a great beer - not a 4.5 by any means, but truly very enjoyable.",0.8003984045363418,4.25,0.9686

Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"Mostly opaque, dark mahogany color. Nice head formation with good retention. Lacing is there, but it's only spotty. Smells rich and malty but not very sweet. Dark toffee and toasted grain at first, then notes of plum and raisin.  Richly malty and only a touch sweet. Raisin and pear, maybe some ripened red grapes in there, too. Well carbonated but soft, even silky. Candi sugar is there but it's very minimal. Yeast character is present through some clove flavor.   Excellent, but not head and shoulders above others in the style as the scores would suggest.

A light dusty funk appears mid palate finishing crisp and tart with some snappy lemon acidity.

Saint Lamvinus,"Poured a non-translucent light purple color - almost like diluted grape juice. Very little head on presentation. The smell is tart, dry and vinous with a whiff of grape skins and oak. Some funk pushing through in the nose. The taste is so balanced and easy to drink. It's tart, dry (not as dry as many of their other fruit lambics), mildly sour with just a slight oak mustiness and notes of fresh grapes skins. While it is an overall dry lambic, there is some sweetness from the grapes that balances out the tartness. It has a medium bodied mouthfeel with just mild acidity, not too harsh. Overall, one of the better Cantillon's I've tried. It really stands out for being well balanced. While it used Merlot grapes, I wouldn't describe the beer having a taste resembling the qualities of Merlot (leathery and dark fruits), however this is a 2014 bottle and it may differ from a fresher version. It does have a nice vinous quality which I assume are from the Merlot grapes.",0.8017330702504856,4.5,0.9588

Medium high carbonation and silky mouthfeel.  Overall, this is excellent lambing style.",0.8005178947207547,4.5,0.9588
Focal Banger,"Pours out a very hazy bright yellow.  Aroma is tropical, citrus, floral and piney dank hops.  Taste is orange, mango with pine, earthy dank hops, floral notes and some big citrus notes too. Lots going on!  Medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel and super smooth.  One of the more intense single IPAs on the market! Lots of flavor above and beyond most DIPAs these days, lots of complexity balanced with some decent bitterness and being super crushable! A truly awesome beer!",0.7961619081865237,4.5,0.9586
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Pours a beautiful golden amber with a nice plump and frothy three finger head of straight white foam.  Definite notes of banana, wheat, fresh grain, slightly spicy yeasty twang, and clove.  Clove, banana, yeasty spice, cereal grains, fresh baked bread.  Light-bodied, high carbonation, soft, creamy smooth, refreshing, incredible.  Overall, this truly stands out in the style as well as in general as a truly amazing beer. With this style it's difficult to stand out in aroma and flavor due to the subtle nuances, but this beer really provides for an awesome and silky smooth experience.",0.7983272192726644,4.5,0.9576
Abrasive Ale,"Pours a golden and clear, one finger head. Smells of sweet malts, sticky hops with citrus. Taste is crisp, nice strong bitter flavor, but not dominating your palate. Bitterness lingers with some subtle sweetness in the mix of all the hoppiness. The ABV is well hidden here, as this is a refreshing and unchallenging DIPA. Really delicious and well done.",0.8297887219189327,4.5,0.9573
Beatification,"Bit of funkiness on the nose. Picking up some fruit, citrus like flavors, lemonade. Almost tastes like it's aged on apricots. Very balanced white wine with sour tart flavors.

Sweet and velvety, no sharp hop notes.  Taste is superb with a light piney and grapefruit hop bitterness up front followed by a moderate intensity orange julius sweetness right in the middle.

Abrasive Ale,This beer is consistently fantastic. The pour is a hazy honey orange with an off white head that fades to subtle lacing and carbonation throughout. Wow the smell bright orange grapefruit citrus with a dank balance and a slight peachy yeast aroma. The taste hits all the aromas perfectly balanced not overly sweet bitter or citrus but does lean toward the citrus side. The taste is near perfect but I do think Pliny and ht are slightly deeper and fuller. The mouthfeel is crisp and full and you want to keep going back to the well for another. Overall a top IPA,0.8215104324743082,4.5,0.9554
Abt 12,"330cl bottle. 5/2/21 bb date. Appearance: Cloudy dark brown with a touch of amber and a low lying offwhite head. Aroma: Toasted bread crust, brown sugar and a light raisin and plum Taste: Starts with a spiced, rich malt sweetness, some pear esters, then bread crusts and apple pop up on the swallow with a fairly high bitterness for the style Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with a pleasant carbonation and a slowly warming alcohol Finish: Retronasal apple and pear aromas are strong on top of a lingering toasted maltiness. Overall: Incredibly smooth and easy drinking, with the complexity of a world class quad. Multi layered malt complexity and fruity Belgian esters, with a brisk carbonation that keeps it lively without being syrupy. High alcohol comes across as a pleasant warming and not harsh. Great beer",0.795937885743439,4.5,0.9537
Todd The Axe Man,"Faintly hazy, bright gold colored body with a relatively thin yet lasting head, a bit soapy, a bit creamy. Powerful scent of citrus and pineapple; orange, lemon; very light note of light grain. Huge juicy flavor infused with a striking yet balanced hop bitterness; grapefruit; subtle cracker notes. Medium bodied; crisp and dry with a bit of alcohol dryness, too.   An outstanding beer with a nice ABV punch, balanced and delightful in all respects.",0.8151690854341336,4.25,0.9531
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Poured 0.5l bottle into a Weizen glass.  A: Deep golden color and hazy (although clear for a Hefeweizen). Thick foamy white head, with excellent retention and very good lacing. High carbonation is visible in the glass.  S: Fresh citrusy notes (lemon/orange), followed by clove, bubblegum and hints of banana.  T: Taste follows the nose. Citrus flavors come first, clove follows, with light bubblegum flavor and banana subtly coming through in a sophisticated way. All perfectly balanced.  M: Feels light-to-medium bodied. Very smooth and crisp, with perfect amount of carbonation in the mouth.  O: Very refreshing and drinkable, with gentle velvety structure. I would call it a very sophisticated Hefeweizen. Variety of notes are delivered without allowing any of them to be too prevalent, but rather come together in a very nice balance.",0.7992361159675817,4.5,0.9528

Everett Porter,"Such a mindblowing porter. Dark black with a great lacing, strong aromas of coffee and earthy hop bitterness, lots of grapefruit citrus. Taste shows cranberry, dark malts and a really robust dark malt profile, smooth coffee and dark chocolate provoke, a gentle carbonation from the growler. A lingering finish with citrus rind, piny forest with a herbal edge. Very full body with a really rich creamy mouthfeel but also a quite assertive bitterness. Espresso, licorice, black molasses, grapefruit citrus, smoky woody character matched by a creamy body and an upfront bitterness. A very flavourful porter, and matched by its great body and balance, delicious and certainly of the most aromatic and well made porters I've tried.",0.8067384444497897,5.0,0.9516
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"One of the best Belgian quads out there. I had the opportunity to try it finally. Great color, the smell is rich with malts, not overwhelming on the palate at all.

Nice showcase of citra hops. More candied oranges, pinneapple, hints of mango, all with a solid hoppy backbone to compliment it. Not much malt detected, which is a good thing. Mouthfeel is soft and pillowy. Excellent.",0.8010467292005868,4.5,0.9501
Supplication,"Bottled 5/11/2015. Poured from a cork and cage into a snifter, the beer is a vibrant, slightly hazed, ruby-tinted brown coloring, with a thin film of off-white head on the surface, and a ton of carbonation flowing throughout the body. Aromas of tart and sour cherries, dark and sweet pinot notes, earthy undertones, hints of currants and berries, and a solid sour component throughout. Flavors are very sour and tart cherry forward, with a solid acidity and richly sweet backbone. That backbone has notes of cherry, chocolate, currants, and toffee, but it is only an accent character, as the tart and sour blend sweeps it up very quickly. Along with the cherry, your taste buds are overrun with tannins, horseblanket, lemon juice, dry and rich pinot characteristics, wood spice and char, tobacco, and an overall sour tone. Very dynamic and layered palate. The body is dry and crisp, with the increased carbonation cleaning up alongside the astringent sourness. The aftertaste is mostly cherry and wood, but with some earthy notes still lingering here and there. The finish is bone dry, with the sour pucker and acidity wringing every last drop of moisture out of your taste buds, leaving them begging for more. What a tremendous beer!",0.8024974058022162,4.75,0.95
Fou' Foune,"Pours a hazy, straw coloration with a tiny, fizzy head. Smell is dominated by sour funk, with some apricot and just a hint of citrus zest coming through as well. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by barnyard funk and hints of apricot and citrus. There's a light estery yeast note and a certain earthy and slightly spicy note to this as well. Finishes very dry and acidic, with only a little sweetness coming through, and another mouth-puckering dose of tartness. Medium body and carbonation. I really didn't feel that this has a very rich, fruity apricot note to it at all, maybe it's the vintage (2017, I believe). The apricot is there, but quite subdued and overshadowed by the strong, funky sourness and citric acidity. This is a very nice lambic without a doubt, but highly overrated in my opinion, as it is neither especially subtle nor complex.",0.8000723149241606,4.0,0.9494

Zombie Dust,Pours a hazy orange with a great fluffy white head. Lot of lacing. Big time citrus aroma! Robust grapefruit and mango notes. Taste is similar to the nose with citrus bitterness but it’s incredibly balanced with caramel sweetness.

Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"Appearance: It has a dark cloudy amber/brown color to it. It has a thick creamy beige head that dies down slowly and leaves some lacing.  Smell: The aromas definitly give out hints of dark fruit (grapes and raisins), with some belgian yeast and spices.   Taste: Like the aromas, it has nice fruity complexity giving out grapes, raisins and plums with a nice spicy clove character and bready yeast.

Zombie Dust,"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, vibrant, golden-copper coloring with a steady flow of carbonation throughout the body, and a foamy, bubbly, low profile, off-white head. Aromas of tart and sweet grapefruit, lemon zest, and orange rind blending with dried grass and piney resinous notes. Flavors are very tartly sweet forward, heavy on citrus, but with some tropical notes here and there, as well. Pineapple and mango highlight the heavy notes of grapefruit and orange rind. All of this atop a bitter green backbone of pine resin, dried grass, and moss. Perfectly balanced, on effervesced, crisp, and dry body. The aftertaste is a solid, balanced blend of the bitter green notes and the citrus medley. Amazingly balanced from beginning to end. The finish is smooth, slightly dry, and effervesced from the carbonation that stays steady flowing the whole time you drink. Amazing beer!",0.8049621357890118,4.75,0.945
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Absolutely shocked that I had never reviewed this one before, as I consider it a (the?) defining example of the style.  Golden color, somewhat cloudy. Pours a monster head, creamy and lingering.   Almost a pilsner like spicy note on the nose initially. A soft, slightly sweet and clove nose as it warms a bit. Slight hint of a sweeter fruity banana kind of aroma.   A slightly sweet and clove flavor up front, fairly balanced despite no apparent hop flavors. A very rounded flavor, incredibly smooth with no rough edges. Not overpowering with banana/clove types of flavors - fairly clean palate for a hefe   MF - Medium body and medium to high carbonation. Surprisingly creamy despite the carbonation.   An incredibly easy drinking beer that has the hefeweizen flavor notes without being overpowering.",0.8036784877696607,4.5,0.9434
Focal Banger,"Thank you, Devin.  Decanted, this beer is a mostly clear light orange with a dense, off-white head with good retention and lacing. The nose is _excellent_. A perfect balance of pungent and bitter hops and fruity and refreshing hops, there's layers of pine, grapefruit, some peach, melon and papaya. A little bit of honey and a little bit of weed are also present. The palate opens clean and bitter, resiny, pine-heavy with some grapefruit pith and fruity mango and peach. Malt character is minimal, though a touch of honeyed toast is present. Oily and resiny with a touch of dank weed on the finish with a clean, bruising bitterness, this beer has a truly breathtaking hop expression. Despite the heavy bitterness, this is remarkably drinkable. Excellent.",0.8008284854112421,4.5,0.943
Green,"Poured into Tree House snifter. Hazy gold with one inch off white bubbly, foamy head that slowly dissipates to a nice ring and thin cap.  Aroma is citrusy with notes of pineapple, tangerine, orange, and a hint of grapefruit. The citrus aroma is followed by some earthy/dank and pine/resin notes.  Taste is similar to the nose with lots of citrus flavors and finishes with piney and dank flavors. Taste is very hop forward. Malts are somewhat hidden but provide a creamy base. The aftertaste is a nice mix of sweetness and hop bite.  Medium bodied with a smooth and creamy feel. Light carbonation.  Overall an excellent IPA.",0.8022721395594105,4.75,0.9428

Sip Of Sunshine,"This is a super solid DIPA. The smell is bursting with dank sticky hops, over ripe fruits, and a hint of honey sweetness. The taste is balanced leaning towards hoppy with firm bitterness. This is what a DIPA should really be. Some reviewers seem to be under the impression this is a NEIPA but it is not. It's a proper American IPA - solid malt backbone balanced perfectly with huge hop flavors, and ending with a strong bitter finish. yb",0.7939934377238597,4.5,0.9418
§ucaba,"900th review! 2015 vintage at 13.3%.  Appearance - Pours a deep ruby red with two fingers of bubbly off-white head.  Smell - Bready malts, caramel/toffee, dark cherry, oak, vanilla bean, hint of alcohol to warm the nose, somewhat port-like aroma, touch of dark chocolate, mild earthy hops.  Taste - Harmonious blend of bready malts, caramel/toffee, dark cherry, oak, and vanilla. Hints of dark chocolate, mild bitter earthy hops, and the slightest alcohol flavour. Sweetness from malts, dark cherry, and dark chocolate lingers on the palate.  Mouthfeel - Medium-to-full bodied with moderate carbonation. There is a smooth warmth of alcohol along with a touch of softness.   Overall - An out-of-this-world English barleywine from Firestone Walker. I can't get over the array of complex flavours and aromas. The vanilla and oak round out this barleywine very nicely. This is a dangerous brew as the alcohol is well hidden, really just providing a nice warmth on the palate.",0.7977771654775961,4.75,0.9418

Gueuze 100% Lambic,"375ml bottle dated 12/3/12 served slightly above cellar temp  Light golden color with head reducing to ring of lacing. Wonderful aromas of fruit - apple, grape, peach - with a slightly sour nose. Taste is fruity rush up front with lemon, apple grape, slightly sweet, almost like a dry riesling, followed by sour notes (both lactic and mild acetic) which dwindle into a dry oaky tannic bitterness. Mouthfeel is inviting with effervescent carbonation over an ever so slightly viscous beer. The flavors combine into a light, flavorful, complex and wonderful beverage. I expected more funk - perhaps that comes with age? A different experience the 3F OG. A bit more refined and lighter on the brett characteristics. Terrific gueuze worth seeking out.",0.7969898880828991,4.75,0.9398

Clean and appealing, but not profound in any way. 4  A surprising bit of raisin flavor is the first thing I taste, followed by unripened peach, earthy, floral funkiness and a sharply tart apricot juice flavor. 4.25  It's tart with some lemony acidity and a full-bodied feel. The finish has some tart bite before a vinous dryness and sticky funkiness that lingers.

The malt is noticeable as well with a bit of caramel sweetness.  Taste is bright citrus hops with a bit of earthy resins. Bitter, but nicely balanced by an ample malt backing.

King Sue,"Pours the color and consistency of white grapefruit juice, topped by an inch of white suds. Gobs of yeast escape on the back end of the pour. Tropical aroma evokes pineapple, mango, lemongrass, apricot, and lightly grassy hops.  The taste is crisp and bright, featuring grassy, peppery hops and grapefruit pith against a backdrop of mild, biscuity malt. It's definitely hop-forward, as one would expect, but not cloyingly so. Medium body and carbonation produce a full, lively mouthfeel that synergizes nicely with the hops.  Overall, this is a bright, refreshing NEIPA with no glaring flaws. It is a testament to execution over concept, for what it lacks in complexity, it makes up for with hitting the mark as far as all the essentials are concerned.",0.8012051325156627,4.25,0.9169

The nose is pungent with fresh orange rind and pine resin. On the tongue is juicy orange, bitter grapefruit pith and a touch of resinous pine. The malt backbone is extremely light - just the way I like an IPA - but with that slightly spicy rye kick. So nice. The mouthfeel is light and pillowy with light, prickly carbonation.

Pseudo Sue,"Pours a hazy, amber color topped by an inch of coarse, white suds. Wonderfully tropical aroma evokes lemon, mango, and grapefruit. Bountiful lees can be seen both in suspension and on the floor of the glass.  The taste is founded on a deft balance of lemongrass, lemon, pepper, and biscuity, crackery malt. The synergy between malt and hops, both of which are tastefully understated, is quite excellent--a cohesive whole more so than the sum of its parts. Medium body and delicate carbonation produce a smooth, velvety mouthfeel that's reinforced by a mildly chalky yeast character. A dry finish leaves you ready to dive back in for more.  Overall, this is a fantastically well-balanced and refreshing APA. While not especially complex, it is well integrated and has no off flavors to speak of. With its delicate, refreshing flavor profile, herbal bitterness, and luscious mouthfeel, it almost evokes an American interpretation of a saison.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation.  Overall, a nice DIPA. I remember it being a bit fruitier with less resin and better balanced on tap.",0.8108045210513856,4.25,0.8288
Nelson,"Poured on-tap in a tulip, the beer is a hazy, bright, golden orange color with a fluffy, clingy, off white head. Aromas of orange, grapefruit, apricot, and melon, all blending and balancing with a grassy and piney hops character. Very balanced. The flavors are tart and sweet forward, with a blend of grapefruit, melon, and passion fruit. Hops notes come in midpalate, providing notes of bitterness, subtle herbal and floral notes, and some dank, vegetal highlights. Smooth, robust bodied, with a dry edge and an aftertaste heavy on resinous hops profiles, bitter and green.The finish has a decent resinous linger, over a smooth, dry feel. Good beer.",0.8267158577779624,4.25,0.8271
Fou' Foune,"From tasting notes when I had this on draft. Pours a hazy yellow, orange color without much head at all. The aroma is bright stone fruit and lemon. Not getting the funk I expected. Taste is bright, tart lemon with apricots, more earthy than funky. Mouth feel is medium bodied and crisp making this very drinkable. It still needs time to develop some more complexity, but still excellent.",0.7941971534632654,4.25,0.8233
Abt 12,"Packed with enough flavors and aromas to push this into fine-wine territory. Velvety, creamy mouthfeel with an almost burning alcohol presence that detracts a little from the spicy, fruity flavors. Dessert in a glass. The best Belgian beer I've had to date   93/100  EDIT (5/28/18):  Had on tap at Six Degrees North in Edinburgh. Raspberries up the wazoo, both in aromas and flavors, this time around. Love it. Less fluffiness in the mouthfeel, but that's ok  EDIT(10/25/18): Finally trying this side by side Rochefort 10. Appearances are roughly the same, with marginally better head retention and lacing on the Rochefort 10. As noted last time, raspberry dominates the aromas, with some doughy maltiness and fruity yeast ester. Flavors of banana bread, caramel, fig, prune, raspberry, currant, and dusty earthiness. Killer silky mouthfeel. Overall I think this inches out Rochefort 10 thanks to its subtle complexity and balance",0.7974265213564484,4.5,0.823
Pseudo Sue,"16oz can. 4/4/19 package date. Appearance: Truly hazy light golden with a fluffy white pillowy head.  Aroma: Strong grassy, mango, pineapple, and citrus hop notes.  Taste: Moderate malt sweetness, bready, quickly turning into a mango and orange citrus with some grassiness and a soft but moderately high bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy bodied for the style, with some creaminess and moderate carbonation.  Finish: Bitterness accelerates on the finish, dry on the tongue, with a touch of grass and citrus rind.  Overall: This has all the components of a top notch hazy IPA, created long before the style is what it is a today. A true showcase of the Citra hop, with such a softness to the bitterness, while delivering an intense hop aroma. Amazing beer",0.8159521869961669,4.5,0.8225
Temptation,"A: Pours a clear straw yellow with three fingers of white head that recedes into a thin cap with decent lacing.  S: Sweet Belgian notes up front with aromas of bubblegum and candy sugar.

Abrasive Ale,"Surly abrasive '15  Pours an orange-amber color, with a half finger broad, white head.  Intriguing aromas of grass, lime, pineapple and biscuity, sweeter malts. Due to the prominent malts, the fruity hops melt well into the beers sweetness, evoking aromas of juicy ananas dipped into honey, with a prikly kiwi peak to it.   Lively, slightly metallic mouthfeel, highlighting the citrus qualities of the beer.  Tastes of citrus, with a dank quality to it and balancing, earthy malts. This is bursting with hops, unleashing a very bitter, slightly tropical onslaught, almost overpowering my palate. It does not, because of glazed malts, providing nothing more but a basic malt presence, letting the hops shine big times. Finishes with an immense, dry bitterness, accentuating citrus hops, which stay on the tongue for a very long time.  Pine and honey, accompanied by a subtle metallic hint, resulting from the carbonation, interact incredible well with the tongue numbing citrus bitterness, tranforming the taste more and more into a tropical fruit direction, due to the distinct, honeyed malts infusion.
